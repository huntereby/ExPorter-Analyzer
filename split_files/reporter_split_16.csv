10857291,"Project Summary/Abstract: The proposal includes a comprehensive 5-year mentored career development
plan for Dr. Frank Ko to transition to an independent investigator who studies intramembranous bone
regeneration. The candidate is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Cell & Molecular Medicine
(CMM) at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) and conducts his research at RUMC and at its affiliated
centers and institutions. He is well supported by the institution and will devote 100% of his time to his research
and career development plan. The candidate has assembled mentors and a scientific advisory committee with
a wide array of complementary expertise and extensive mentoring experience to offer career guidance during
his transition to independent research and train him in new intellectual and technical skills for his proposed
studies. His mentor, Dr. Rick Sumner, is an expert in the field of bone regeneration and implant fixation, the
Chair of CMM at RUMC, and the director of Rush MicroCT/Histology Core Facility. His co-mentor, Dr. Anna
Spagnoli, is a clinician-scientist with an expertise in the field of skeletal development and diseases and is the
director of Section of Molecular Medicine in the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at RUMC. Scientific
advisory committee member Dr. Noriaki Ono is a molecular biologist studying skeletal stem and progenitor
cells. The science focuses on the role of periostin-expressing cells in intramembranous bone regeneration
following marrow ablation surgery. The candidate discovered that these cells, which are normally absent in
marrow and reside in the periosteum, are present in the regenerating marrow cavity following the surgery and
their depletion delays intramembranous bone regeneration. Thus, the specific aims are to investigate: 1) the
necessity of periostin-expressing cells and periostin in intramembranous bone regeneration; and 2) the lineage
commitment, molecular signatures, and differentiation of periostin-expressing cells and their progeny during
intramembranous bone regeneration. To complement his prior training in bone biomechanics and molecular
biology in intact tissues, the candidate will be trained in the use of reporter mice, animal surgery, and
regenerated bone phenotyping, including light sheet and expansion microscopy, gene and protein expression
analyses, and in vitro culture and assay. Further, he will participate in career development activities that
include didactic lectures and seminar series focusing on tissue regeneration, stem cell biology, biostatistics,
grant writing, responsible conduct of research, and scientific presentation. This K01 proposal will allow the
candidate to gain valuable career development mentoring to achieve his goal of becoming an independent
investigator studying intramembranous bone regeneration."

This proposal seeks to develop a dedicated Cancer Epigenetics Training (CET) program at Van Andel
Research Institute (VARI) to train two new postdoctoral fellows per year for three years each. The objective
of the CET is to prepare 10 postdoctoral fellows to become independent academic and industry research
leaders in the field of cancer epigenetics. The CET program will build upon the Center for Epigenetics that
was established in 2014 by Peter Jones, Ph.D., D.Sc. (hon) and has grown into a world-class, internationally
recognized center of excellence for basic and translational epigenetics research. To launch the CET program,
we have assembled a team of 9 mentors and 6 co-mentors who collectively hold ~$5.7M of funding per year
and have highly complementary and interdisciplinary cancer and epigenetics expertise. CET faculty include
several epigenetics pioneers; two members of the National Academy of Sciences; the Van Andel Institute
Stand Up to Cancer Epigenetics Dream Team (VAI-SU2C); two leaders of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
project; and mentors/co-mentors from all career stages. Trainees will be able to pursue basic and translational
research projects in cancer biology; tumorigenesis, cellular development and differentiation; mechanisms
governing DNA methylation and chromatin regulation; epigenomics and advanced tool development; GWAS
and EWAS; transgenerational inheritance; structural biology; metabolism; and epigenetic therapies. The CET
program is overseen by a dedicated Advisory Committee composed of domain-level experts from academic,
industrial, and clinical careers. We have developed a targeted diversity and recruitment plan to increase the
T32-eligible pool size and attract and retain individuals from underrepresented groups. Upon acceptance,
each Trainee is assigned an Individual Development Team (IDT) to coach, mentor, and guide the Trainee
through the scientific and non-scientific dimensions of career development. The faculty and CET Trainees are
supported by a dedicated Office of Postdoctoral Affairs that is directed by a PhD-level biomedical career
development professional. Each Trainee is required to complete a comprehensive curriculum of scientific and
professional development training. Key deliverables and milestones for T32 Trainees include annual seminars
(internal and external); at least one semester of teaching or mentoring experience; one first-authored
publication; and at least one submitted F32 (or equivalent) and K99/R00 application. The training
requirements and expectations are formalized within Individual Development Plans (IDPs) that are reviewed
annually by the Advisory Committee. Research-related, individualized training not otherwise defined in the
CET training program is provided by VARI. The CET will be rigorously evaluated through entrance, annual,
exit, and alumni assessments. With the superlative faculty, resources, and guidance afforded by the CET,
postdoctoral fellows will emerge with a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary skill set, perspective, and foundation
from which to establish their independent research careers in cancer epigenetics."

We propose to establish a Chemistry–Biology Interface (CBI) Training Program that will enable trainees at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) to obtain the breadth of scientific training essential for
modern, mechanistically informed chemical biology. This program draws from two historically successful
programs at UNC: the Division of Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry (CBMC) in the UNC Eshelman
School of Pharmacy, and the Biological and Organic Chemistry Divisions in the UNC Department of Chemistry
(College of Arts and Sciences). These two units have a strong and continuing tradition of collaboration,
common coursework, and a shared seminar series. Although UNC has a highly regarded scientific tradition,
there is no chemistry-oriented NIH training program on the UNC campus. The proposed program will bring
together 25 established researchers who encompass the breadth of chemical biology, ranging from analytical
bioanalysis to protein structure/function to medicinal chemistry/drug design. In addition, three promising junior
faculty members will join the program as “mentored mentors”, working closely with senior colleagues as they
continue to establish their programs. The program leaders, one from CBMC and one from the Department of
Chemistry, are accomplished senior faculty with mentoring and administrative experience; they will provide
program guidance with input from an internal steering committee and a distinguished group of external
advisors. Students will be recruited from the two primary units and from a UNC umbrella biological/biomedical
sciences program that has shown remarkable success in recruiting outstanding and diverse graduate students
to the campus. The training program includes (1) common coursework that establishes the basis for research
at the chemistry–biology interface, including responsible conduct of research and rigor/reproducibility training,
(2) biweekly meetings that alternate between a journal club and a smaller discussion group focused on
individual learning and professional development, (3) an program retreat that will be held before the fall
semester, providing orientation and early formal training in rigor and reproducibility, and (4) a trainee-organized
symposium that will become a major annual event at UNC. Work at the chemistry–biology interface has
become increasingly relevant as our understanding of biology has required more molecular insights.
Accordingly, the activities of the proposed program will capitalize on the diverse expertise in CBMC and
Chemistry, and the extensive educational and research resources that are available at this internationally
recognized institution. This program will provide trainees with a superior education from the perspective of
depth and breadth, and develop well-trained PhD scholars at the interface of chemistry and biology who will
play a critical role in the biomedical sciences across academia and industry."
10828418,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a cholestatic liver disease of infancy and is the leading cause of pediatric
liver transplantation. Current evidence supports the principle that BA arises from an aberrant
immune response to an environmental trigger. However, the exact mechanism of disease remains
unknown. While macrophages (M) have been implicated in both human and murine BA, M are
heterogeneous by nature and the metabolic networks responsible for pro-restorative vs pro-
inflammatory M polarization have not been defined. Our central premise is that identifying
macrophage-specific immune-metabolic signatures associated with patient outcome will lead to
novel prognostic biomarkers and cell-subset specific therapies to prolong transplant-free survival.
We have been the first to identify a prognostic metabolite signature in BA infants at the time of
diagnosis. We have shown that distinct changes in serum arginine metabolites, particularly
increased polyamines, in BA infants at the time of diagnosis was associated with increased
survival with native liver (SNL) at the age of 2 years despite no baseline differences in clinical
characteristics. Polyamines are known to reprogram M to an anti-inflammatory phenotype, in
part through efferocytosis (i.e. apoptotic cell uptake). Our preliminary data found that BA patients
with a polyamine-high metabolic signature had increased hepatic numbers of previously
characterized monocyte-like M (MLM, increased expression for genes associated with
monocytes) and serum GM-CSF. We thereby hypothesize that recruited MLM promote hepatic
adaptation to biliary obstruction; thus, metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming of MLM towards
and anti-inflammatory phenotype will be associated with SNL at 2 years of age. To investigate
this hypothesis, we will: 1) define the prognostic role for serum arginine metabolites, and 2)
identify cell subset specific transcriptional phenotypes associated with SNL."
10910100,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infection remains the most prevalent bacterial sexually transmitted infection (STI)
worldwide, with over 120 million new CT infections reported annually. In the US, African Americans and women
are disproportionally affected by CT infection. Although over 1.5 million CT cases were recently reported in the
US, this is likely an underestimation as the above-mentioned vulnerable population experiences inequities in
access to routine healthcare. Women experience a greater burden of CT infection due to many reproductive
complications associated with this infection. To date, prevention and control efforts have not significantly reduced
CT infection rates. In addition, up to 20% of infected persons are reinfected within a year suggesting either a
short lived or suboptimal immunity. In the context of both murine models and human studies, we and others have
previously showed a role of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells in chlamydia clearance and protection against
reinfection. Recent studies in humans have however shown that CD8 T cells could play a role in CT infection as
well. CD8 T cells recognize pathogens in the context of peptides presented by an infected cell via classical MHC-
Ia alleles (in humans, HLA-A, B or C) or non-classical MHC-Ib alleles (in case of humans, HLA-E). Prior work
has shown that HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells (HLA-E/CD8s) exert an important immune-regulatory role in control
of several intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium and Salmonella. The role of HLA-E/CD8s in
CT infection as it pertains to clearance of CT infection is unknown. Two previous human studies examining CD8
T cell responses to CT indirectly demonstrated responses restricted by non-classical HLA-I alleles. However,
the precise nature of this restriction and the role of such cells in disease pathogenesis as it pertains to clearance
of CT infection was not defined. Since HLA-Ia and HLA-Ib (i.e., HLA-E) are ubiquitously co-expressed,
appropriate molecular tools and methodologies are needed to dissect the unique contributions of CD8 T cells
responding to peptides presented via each of these alleles. We have recently generated HLA-E*01:01 and
E*01:03 specific cellular resources that allowed us to identify HLA-E/CD8s and to assess their relevance in the
context of CT infection. Specifically, our preliminary data shows that HLA-E/CD8s producing CD107a/IFN-γ/TNF-
α are preferentially detected in women who clear CT infection. Our overall hypothesis is that HLA-E restricted
CD8 T cells will play an important role in clearance of CT infection in women. In Aim 1, we will determine
if CT-specific HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells play a role in the clearance of CT infection in women. In Aim 2, we
will determine if CT-specific HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells can be primed from CT naïve female donors with no
current or prior CT infection. In summary our completed studies will demonstrate the biological relevance and
functionality of HLA-E restricted CD8 T cell response in clearance of CT infection and thus has direct applications
for immunogen selection for a preventative CT based vaccine."

There is presently an urgent need to develop methodical approaches to evaluate the function of genomic vari-
ants. Clinical genomic testing is growing rapidly, and with it a larger-than-ever number of genetic variants that
cannot be defined as either disease-causing or benign. The problem affects clinicians and their patients, who
struggle to understand and interpret molecular diagnostic reports, the implications of the results, and how to
manage their patients in the absence of definitive information. Systems that involve single cells to generate
high-content, high-resolution functional data are of paramount importance to solving the problem posed by var-
iants of uncertain significance. Here, we propose to utilize a novel cell-based platform that uses machine learn-
ing to determine the combination of morphological phenotypes that define pathogenicity. We will apply the
technology to the comprehensive functional assessment of variants in IDS, the gene responsible for Hunter
syndrome. The core hypothesis outlined in this proposal is that experimental data measuring the direct func-
tional effects of variants will inform accurate disease risk prediction. In addition, we hypothesize that an in vitro,
cell-based assay based on morphological features will more accurately detect disease compared to existing
biochemical testing using artificial substrates. We will perform a functional assay in a variant library using the
RaftSeq pipeline in the Buchser laboratory, where a cellular phenotype will be established and then tested us-
ing a second set of variants combined with rescue experiments. The results will inform variant classification in
IDS molecular testing and improve diagnosis of individuals including those identified by low iduronate-2-sulfa-
tase activity on newborn screening."
10811759,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally, despite effective
therapies for many known risk factors. The majority of CAD loci identified by genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) are not associated with traditional risk factors, providing opportunities to discover novel mechanisms
and therapies. Encouragingly, many new therapies targeting causal genes and pathways inspired by GWASs
have received approval or fared favorably in clinical trials. Despite the success, the bottleneck remains the lack
of experimental studies systematically linking CAD variants to the causal genes and pathways at scale in a cell
type-specific manner. To overcome these barriers and define tissue/cell type-specific contribution to the genetic
predisposition of CAD risks, we leverage the STARNET eQTL data in nine CAD-relevant tissue/cell type
from >1300 subjects and public eQTL data of immune and vascular cells. Aim 1 will apply advanced
computational pipelines to nominate candidate causal CAD variants, cis-regulatory elements (cREs), and their
target genes and related pathways at CAD loci in CAD-relevant tissue and cell types, providing tissue/cell type-
specific mechanistic and therapeutic insights for CAD. Initial analysis supports that ~30% CAD risk loci are most
strongly associated with eQTLs in macrophages or foamy macrophages compared with the other seven tissues
in STARNET data. This is in line with the major role of circulating monocyte-derived macrophages in driving
atherosclerosis. Leveraging the rich functional genomic datasets available for monocytes/macrophages, Aim 2
will apply mid-throughput functional assays, including single-cell CRISPR screening, massively parallel reporter
assay, and arrayed knockout or overexpression cellular assays, to experimentally define the genetic
contributions of monocytes/macrophages to CAD by connecting variants to genes and phenotypic roles, and
build machine learning models predicting functional cREs and their target genes. Our study addresses unmet
needs in the functional follow-up of CAD GWASs by performing integrative genomic analysis of CAD loci at an
unprecedented scale, experimentally connecting variant to function in cell types critical for the genetic
predisposition of CAD, building machine learning models for predicting functional cREs and their target genes
for improved prioritization workflow, and providing a generalizable framework for extended discoveries in other
CAD-relevant cell types. With the MPI’s expertise in statistical genetics, machine learning, macrophage biology,
and functional genomics, our study has significant and broad impacts by providing (1) novel insights into
tissue/cell type-specific contributions to the genetic predisposition of CAD that inform new biological mechanisms
and therapeutic targets; (2) a catalog of phenotypically tested target genes highly likely to be causal for CAD,
allowing immediate refocus to the most promising targets for accelerated translation, and (3) an innovative
computational and experimental framework for systematic variant-to-function discoveries."

Persistent and symptomatic anxiety during childhood is pathological and is a risk factor for the later development
of stress-related psychopathology. Anxious young girls are particularly at risk, as during the transition to
adolescence the prevalence of anxiety disorders (ADs) and depression markedly increases in females compared
to males. Our work in children demonstrates that persistent and symptomatic anxiety is dimensionally related to
altered function of neural circuits identified to be associated with responses to threat. Additionally, anxiety
symptoms and levels of distress are highly overlapping between children that do and do not meet DSM-5 criteria
for ADs. These findings, along with the risk conferred by early-life anxiety, provide a rationale for studying the
broad range of pathological anxiety in preadolescent girls. In addition to daytime worries and fears, sleep-related
symptoms (e.g. pre-sleep arousal, poor sleep quality) are common in anxiety, occurring in up to 90% of youth
with ADs. It is critical to understand how sleep physiology relates to the pathophysiology of childhood anxiety
because sleep is a homeostatic regulator that is involved in learning and memory consolidation, and also
influences emotion regulation. Here, we will use a translational approach leveraging our nonhuman primate
(NHP) model of pathological anxiety to conduct parallel neuroimaging and EEG sleep studies in preadolescent
girls and preadolescent female rhesus monkeys with pathological anxiety. Using multimodal imaging, hdEEG
sleep recordings, and home sleep EEG data, studies in preadolescent girls with pathological anxiety will explore
hypotheses implicating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and anterior insula (AI) in mediating altered anxiety-
related daytime neural circuit function as well as alterations in REM and regional slow wave sleep. Studies using
similar methods will be performed in NHPs that will be aimed at causal mechanisms. By chemogenetically
activating BLA or AI neurons prior to sleep, the NHP studies will test the roles of the BLA and AI in mediating the
linkage between alterations in sleep and daytime neural circuit function that are associated with pathological
anxiety. Understanding daytime neural alterations associated with pathological anxiety in relation to disrupted
sleep physiology is highly relevant for elucidating mechanisms underlying childhood pathological anxiety and in
conceptualizing new treatment approaches."
10833119,"AI-Powered Biased Ligand Design
A biased ligand which elicits a certain cellular signal but does not affect other pathways is an
attractive drug candidate as it can minimize unwanted or adverse effects. Unfortunately, very few
current computer-aided drug design methods can enable biased ligand design. Moreover, there
is an urgent need to expand the druggable chemical space for those very promising drug targets
which have plenty of potent ligands developed, but unfortunately, no approved drugs. We plan to
apply the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to address the two challenges by developing
interaction profile scoring function models to enable biased ligand design, and Drug-GAN models
to achieve de novo chemical structure design. The central hypothesis of this application states
that the function as well as the signaling pathways elicited by a ligand is encoded in the ligand-
residue interaction profile (IP), and machine learning algorithms can learn the key attributes of
the IP and generate scoring functions, coined IPSFs, to recognize similar ligands in a screening
library. The second hypothesis of this application states that generative adversarial networks
(GAN) can learn chemical patterns from input and de novo design novel chemical structures.
Thus, the AI-powered algorithms and Drug-GAN models will be able to tackle the two challenges,
and likely revolutionize future drug discovery. Cannabinoid receptors, CB1R and CB2R, are an
ideal model target system for experimental evaluation. The proposal has four aims. In Aim 1, we
will develop IPSFs to specifically design agonists or antagonists of CB1R or CB2R, and agonists
which can activate a certain signaling pathway. Those target-specific, function-specific and
signaling pathway-specific IPSFs will enable biased ligand design. In Aim 2, we will develop Drug-
GAN models to rationally design novel chemical structures as potential agonists or antagonists of
CB1R and CB2R. In Aim 3, we will acquire top hits of screening compounds and Drug-GAN
designed compounds, and conduct binding and functional assays to validate the predictions. In
Aim 4, we will develop an expandable computational platform called PBLD to integrate the
developed IPSF models and Drug-GAN-generated druglike chemicals, and launch webtools and
APIs to conduct biased ligand design using the developed IPSF models and de novo design using
the developed Drug-GAN models. We estimate that IPSFs and Drug-GAN models can be
generated for about 300 drug targets based on a recent statistics analysis on the ChEMBL
database. PBLD has the potential to become a national resource for biased ligand design with
more and more IPSF and Drug-GAN models implemented to PBLD."
10929296,"Project Summary
Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is a serious eating disorder with a mortality rate among the highest of any psychiatric
illness. Identifying modifiable targets for the development of novel AN interventions is crucial because leading
treatments achieve remission rates of less than 50%, and relapse is common. One aspect of AN that likely
contributes to poor long-term outcomes is maladaptive food choice, i.e., the persistent and stereotyped choice
of low-calorie, low-fat foods. Food choice requires individuals to construct the subjective value of foods from a
number of attributes. Yet, despite the centrality of food choice in AN, little is known about how people with AN
construct the subjective values placed on foods, leading to maladaptive food-choice behavior. The overall goal
of this research is to elucidate the cognitive and neural mechanisms that contribute to subjective food valuation
in AN. Leveraging fMRI, eyetracking, and computational models that have advanced understanding of
decision-making in healthy individuals, we propose two studies to examine: (1) how individuals with AN
combine across attributes to construct subjective value for food; (2) how the cognitive and neural mechanisms
that contribute to valuation and food choice differ between individuals with AN and healthy controls (HC); and
(3) how the value construction process can be biased to influence food choice. Study 1 will examine choices,
reaction times, eyetracking, and fMRI measures obtained while individuals with AN (n=75) and HC (n=75)
perform a novel multi-attribute decision task during which they will rate food items on attributes such as
healthiness, tastiness, and savoriness, and then choose between 2 “meals” each composed of three different
food items from different categories. We hypothesize that compared to HC, individuals with AN will base their
subjective valuation of meal options largely on healthiness-related attributes and attend more to healthiness-
related attributes. We also hypothesize that representations of healthiness in patterns of BOLD activity in the
orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) will be more related to food choice in AN than HC. Study 2 will use cue-approach
training (CAT), which has shown that the mere association of a cue and an action (a button press) with an
image leads to enduring preference changes and attentional biases in favor of cued items. We will combine CAT
with multi-attribute choices used in Study 1 and cue highly tasty foods for all participants. We hypothesize that
attentional bias following CAT will alter the value construction process in AN (but not HCs) by increasing the
value of tastiness attributes, and that healthiness representations in patterns of BOLD activity in AN OFC will
be no more related to meal choices than tastiness representations. This research is the first effort to identify
mechanisms underlying subjective food valuation in AN, and test whether value construction can be altered to
normalize food-choice behavior. Results will inform the development of novel, neuroscience-based
interventions designed to modify food preferences in AN and enhance the efficacy of existing treatments."
10922673,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maternal inflammation during pregnancy, as defined by elevated levels of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines,
can have adverse effects on offspring neurodevelopment. However, mechanisms remain elusive. Accelerated
biological aging has been proposed as an underlying mechanism by which prenatal exposures influence future
health. This process can be evaluated through epigenetic clocks, which estimate epigenetic age based on DNA
methylation levels, and are widely used as clinically relevant biomarkers that measure epigenetic age
acceleration. To date, pediatric epigenetic studies have been limited by: (1) use of adult-specific or all-age clocks;
and (2) scant longitudinal epigenetic data due to challenges of pediatric blood collection. Here, we use a newly
developed pediatric-specific clock [the pediatric buccal epigenetic (PedBE) clock] that can be evaluated using
non-invasive buccal swabs, facilitating repeat measures across childhood. Our long-term goal is to identify easy-
to-measure biomarkers in infants and young children that reflect exposure to maternal inflammation during
pregnancy and predict subsequent risk for morbidity in offspring. This innovative and cost-effective longitudinal
study will leverage the infrastructure, biorepository, and extant data of a rigorously phenotyped cohort of healthy
pregnant women and their offspring followed from the first trimester through age 4 (R01HD083369,
UH3OD023349). The Understanding Pregnancy Signals and Infant Development (UPSIDE-ECHO) cohort
includes comprehensive assessments of inflammation across pregnancy, repeated measures of
neurodevelopment across childhood, detailed psychological, sociodemographic, clinical, and life history data,
and a rich repository of biospecimens collected from 2015 – 2024 (age 3-4 visits in progress). Our central
hypothesis is that maternal inflammation during pregnancy accelerates the offspring’s epigenetic age, adversely
influencing neurodevelopment. Our interdisciplinary research team is comprised of experts in maternal and child
health, epigenomics, immunology, cognitive science, perinatal epidemiology, and biostatistics. In Aim 1, we will
establish trajectories of longitudinal changes in offspring epigenetic age from birth through 4 years of age and
identify factors associated with offspring epigenetic age acceleration. In Aim 2, we will study associations
between maternal inflammation during pregnancy and offspring epigenetic age acceleration. In Aim 3, we will
examine associations between offspring epigenetic age and neurocognition through age 4, and explore if
epigenetic age mediates the association between maternal inflammation during pregnancy and neurocognitive
outcomes. The research proposed in this R01 is significant because it will generate new insights into the link
between maternal inflammation during pregnancy and genomic biomarkers of accelerated aging, with a focus
on how accelerated epigenetic age can impact offspring neurocognition. This formative work will advance our
understanding of how epigenetic age trajectories change across a critical developmental period and identify
opportunities for maternal/offspring interventions to improve neurocognitive outcomes across the entire lifespan."
10813096,"Summary:
CD19 directed CAR-T cells have transformed the treatment landscape of B-cell lymphoid malignancies.
However, despite high initial complete remission rates, relapses occur within the first year of therapy in
approximately 50% of patients who receive commercially available autologous CAR19 T-cells. Relapses can be
classified into two patterns: CD19-positive relapse related to CAR T-cell exhaustion and senescence, or CD19-
negative relapse related to target antigen loss. Patients who relapse after CAR19 T-cell therapy have poor
prognosis; hence, there is an urgent need to develop the next-generation of CAR engineered immune effector
cells that target tumors with efficacy and with minimal toxicity. There is growing interest in natural killer (NK) cells
as a candidate for CAR therapy as they may prevent antigen escape through their innate ability to kill tumor cells
and they are safe and well-suited for use in the allogeneic therapy setting. In a first-in-human study, our group
showed the safety and promising activity of cord blood (CB) derived CAR-NK cells targeting CD19 in patients
with B-lymphoid malignancies (Liu et al NEJM 2020). This proposal aims to build on this platform to develop the
next-generation NK cell therapies by enhancing NK cell potency and persistence through optimal costimulatory
signaling, cytokine armoring and checkpoint inhibition. We have identified CD70, as a novel therapeutic target
in patients with B-NHL after CAR19 T-cell failure and developed a novel strategy to target CD70 by genetically
modifying CB-NK cells with a retroviral vector (iC9-CD27-DAP10-CD3ζ-IL-15) that incorporates (i) the gene for
a truncated human CD27 (the natural receptor for CD70) to redirect their specificity; (ii) DAP10 as an NK-specific
costimulatory domain linked to a CD3ζ signaling endodomain; (iii) IL-15 to support their survival and proliferation,
and (iv) inducible caspase-9 (iC9) as a suicide gene. Our preliminary data show the efficacy and safety of this
approach in vitro and in vivo and support its translation to the clinic. In addition, we have developed a robust
strategy to cryopreserve CAR-NK cells, allowing for the generation of a biobank of off-the-shelf engineered NK
cells, thus reducing cost and increasing accessibility. Finally, we have devised a novel strategy to target the
immune checkpoint CIS in our CAR-NK cells to modulate their metabolic fitness and potency. We hypothesize
that targeting CD70 with iC9/CAR27D10ζ/IL-15 NK cells will greatly improve outcomes in patients with NHL after
CAR19 T-cell failure and that by targeting the immune checkpoint CIS we can further enhance the CAR-NK cells’
metabolic fitness and potency. These concepts will be evaluated in three specific aims: In Aim 1 we will conduct
a Phase I/II clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of iC9/CAR27D10ζ/IL-15 NK cells in patients with CD70+
NHL who have failed CAR19 T-cell therapy (FDA approved, IND #27757). In Aim 2 we will apply innovative
single-cell proteomic and transcriptomic studies to comprehensively characterize the fate of the CAR-NK cells
and to identify key mechanisms of efficacy and resistance. In Aim 3, we will perform mechanistic studies to
elucidate how CIS deletion enhances the metabolic fitness of CAR-NK cells and will perform IND enabling studies
in preparation for the next-generation clinical studies testing CIS deficient iC9/CAR27D10ζ/IL-15 NK cells."

Untreated, urinary urgency and incontinence can precipitate a vicious cycle of decreasing physical activity,
social isolation, fear-of-falling, and falls. The urge to urinate frequently can also limit physical activity - concern
for finding oneself too far from a bathroom can be a powerful motivator for just staying home. Structured
behavioral interventions or medications are common initial treatment options. But they elicit their effects
through very different mechanisms of action that may influence fall related outcomes differently. There is,
however, a critical lack of direct head-to-head trial evidence on non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic
treatments for urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), particularly in women with co-existing fall risk. The proposed
feasibility pilot study is a randomized, multi-arm, mixed methods, clinical trial comparing three currently in use
initial treatment options for older women: i) a 12-week structured behaviorally based pelvic floor muscle
training (PFMT) intervention administered by physical therapists in the clinic; ii) a 12-week course of the beta-3
agonist, Mirabegron; and iii) a 12-week course of the antimuscarinic, Trospium Chloride, in women 65 and
older with UUI or overactive bladder (OAB) who also screen positive for increased risk of falling. Mirabegron
and Trospium are not associated with longitudinal effects on cognition that the traditionally used anticholinergic
mediations have recently been linked to. Our Specific Aims are 1) Conduct a pilot study in clinical settings to
determine the feasibility of enrolling older women with UUI or OAB who are at high risk of falling in a three-arm
(PFMT, vs. mirabegron vs. Trospium), randomized comparative effectiveness trial; 2) Characterize outcomes
across the three interventions; and 3) Qualitatively explore perceived factors influencing the non-
pharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment experience in these patients. Forty-eight ambulatory women (16
per arm) 65 years and older with UUI or OAB and who screen positive for high fall risk will be randomized
(1:1:1) to one of three arms. Feasibility will be determined through key milestones on evaluability, adherence to
the interventions, attrition, adverse events, productive recruitment methods, and sample characteristics. We
will also measure important indicators of symptom severity, quality of life, physical activity, falls, and fear of
falling. Building upon our preliminary work, fall risk will be determined by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) fall risk screening tool. The
proposed study is the first to compare these common non-surgical treatments for UUI and OAB in a high fall
risk patient population and will lay the groundwork for a program of research investigating the bidirectional
relationships that exist across these two common geriatric syndromes both at the level of shared risk factors
and responses to treatment."

Neuropathy is a highly prevalent, disabling condition that leads to pain and reduced quality of life, yet little is
known about neuropathy diagnosis and management in Black, low-income populations. Our preliminary data
indicates that 61% of primarily Black, low-income patients >40 years with neuropathy are undiagnosed.
Without appropriate diagnosis, optimal management of modifiable risk factors, such as hyperglycemia and
obesity, and neuropathic pain is unlikely. Computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) improve
primary care physician (PCP) diagnoses and management by delivering evidence-based recommendations
based on patient characteristics. This proposal’s overall objective is to assess neuropathy diagnosis and
management at two Flint, Michigan clinics (54% Black, 40% <US poverty line), then adapt and pilot an
intervention to address determinants of gaps in neuropathy diagnosis and management. We expect that there
is substantial a neuropathy diagnostic and management gap among Black, low-income patients and that an
adapted CDSS will reduce these gaps. These hypotheses will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
quantify gaps in neuropathy diagnosis and management in a predominantly Black, low-income population, 2)
determine PCP-level predictors of gaps in diagnosis and management, and 3) adapt a CDSS intervention
emphasizing neuropathy screening, risk factor modification, and pain management and evaluate CDSS reach,
adoption, and implementation. The first aim will use a piloted study design to assess neuropathy prevalence
and determine gaps in diagnosis and management. The second aim will utilize the Theoretical Domains
Framework to assess PCP knowledge, attitudes, and clinic level determinants of neuropathy diagnosis,
management of risk factors and neuropathic pain using mixed methods. The final aim involves adapting an
existing CDSS intervention for neuropathic pain to include neuropathy diagnosis and risk factor management.
This intervention will then be piloted at two clinics in different health systems serving predominantly Black and
low-income patients. The proposed research is highly innovative because it examines gaps in neuropathy
diagnosis and management among a population most likely to be affected by neuropathy and their usual
PCPs, which few studies have done. Even fewer have assessed determinants of gaps in neuropathy diagnosis
and management in this patient population. Uncovering determinants of neuropathy diagnosis and
management represents a significant impact as this will form the foundation for an intervention aimed at
improving neuropathy diagnosis and management in this population and other similar, underserved
populations."

Title: B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-driven mechanistic connection between B cell lymphomagenesis
and autoimmunity
 Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies affecting lymphocytes.
Collectively, NHL are the fifth most common cancers in the US, and more than 90% of NHL are of B cell origin.
There are roughly equal number of T and B cells in spleen and more T cells in lymph nodes. Why are B cells
so prone to lymphomagenesis? This is probably due to B cell-specific DNA mutagenesis processes, somatic
hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). SHM/CSR are initiated by activation-induced
deaminase (AID) and are required to produce high affinity isotype-switched antibodies (Abs) that are essential
for immunity against pathogens. However, B cells pay a high price for utilizing AID to generate point mutations
or DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) during SHM/CSR. AID is a genome mutator and, if dysregulated, can
cause genome-wide DSBs that lead to chromosomal translocations and lymphomas. Hence, AID expression is
tightly controlled and only occurs in activated B cells during infection or immunization.
 B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is essential for B cell survival and for recognizing specific antigens
including self-antigens. However, signaling by the BCR alone cannot induce AID expression and CSR in vitro,
and it is unclear whether BCR activation by antigen alone can induce AID expression in vivo. Why is it such an
important question to be addressed? Because this may serve as a protective mechanism to keep self-reactive
B cells from turning cancerous. If antigen alone could induce AID expression in the absence of pathogen-
associated co-stimulation, B cells might generate harmful auto-antibody responses, given the abundance of
self-antigens in our body. Chronic activation of BCR by such self-antigens will lead to survival and proliferation
of B cells, which, together with abnormally induced AID expression, would significantly increase the likelihood
of tumorigenesis. Hence, understanding the role of BCR signaling in AID regulation is highly significant, with
important implications for autoimmunity and B cell lymphomagenesis as well as the mechanistic connection
between these two pathological conditions. In this proposal, we will elucidate what factors regulate the ability
of BCR to induce AID expression, genomic instability and lymphomagenesis in B cells."
10833173,"Abstract. The rate of progress in understanding the basis for reproductive health and disease is breathtaking,
accelerated ever further by constant advances in cellular and molecular techniques. Nonetheless, research in
traditional academic departments and research in clinical departments often does not overlap. As such, the PhD
trained in a purely academic environment will remain unexposed to the clinical mindset and practices and so fail
to pursue translational goals, while the clinician Fellow is well aware of the clinical problem and by definition
focused on the human itself, but may be less aware of recent conceptual and methodologic advances available
to investigate clinically derived research questions. As PA-18-403 RFA states, “past studies have shown that
health professional trainees who train in programs with postdoctoral researchers who have intensive research
backgrounds are more likely to apply for and receive subsequent research grant support”. To that end, the goal
of this proposal is simple - to provide for the PhD and MD Fellow a combined and integrated immersion
experience in a cutting edge cross campus research program that is in itself embedded in and focused upon a
more clinical environment where health and disease is the primary consideration, and to then promote the use
of nonhuman primate and human derived models in MD or PhD Fellowship projects lead by MD/DVM/PhD
Faculty of combined clinical and traditional training backgrounds. The campus home for this program will be the
integrated Program in Endocrinology (iPEnd), which was founded in 2016 to foster and promote collaboration
focused on fetal development and the compromised adult outcomes of adverse pregnancy. We propose here
that iPEnd also offers a vibrant interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary environment comprised of MD, PhD and
DVM trained faculty with which both MD and PhD Postdoctoral Fellows could train together to enter the world of
translational research. Such a blended training environment is very much needed if we are to maintain a future
pool of interdisciplinary translational research team members intellectually and professionally ready to pursue
the goals of NICHD to improve reproductive health and outcomes. Another consideration by NIH is that trainees
do not go on to future independent success by simple exposure to ‘good science’ alone. Indeed, both Trainees
and Trainers need support and professional education to ensure the best outcomes. To that end, our proposed
training includes a deep immersion in higher level research training typical of many T32 programs at this time,
but we aim to go far beyond to include the evidence based 8 core competencies for Postdoctoral trainees
combined with added Mentee and Mentor training and the complimentary Professional Development Resources
in order to achieve the rich blended training environment so strongly recommended by NIH. We believe iPEnd
is ready to promote the concepts of the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary ‘Translational Workforce’ through
the proposed Training Program, operating within first class campus environment geared for basic but
increasingly supportive of translational research. On that basis, we submit this application."
10834839,"ABSTRACT: This Conte Center proposal unites collaborators from 15 different institutions with the overarching
goal to understand the role of slow network fluctuation in the brain. Across Center projects, experimental data
will be collected on humans and non-human primates (NHP). The Data Aggregation, Standardization, and
Sharing Core (DASS-C; Core C) is the component of this center through which the overall management and
sharing of experimental and processed data will be conducted. Dr. Alexandre Franco will serve as the project
leader of the DASS-C and will be based at the Nathan Kline Institute (NKI). We will support the research efforts
within our team project, by facilitating the standardization and sharing of data across projects, member
laboratories, and the scientific community at large. We will follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
and reusable) guiding principles for scientific data management and sharing. The DASS-C will also perform
quality control and minimal preprocessing of the data and support the computational needs across P1-4 and
Core B (Multimodal Data Analysis & Integration Core).Thus, the overarching goal of the DASS-C is to
maximize the scientific value of the data produced by the center and to minimize the difficulty in accessing it
among center researchers and the scientific community. We have four Specific Aims. 1) - Guide and support
the development and adoption of community data standards. 2) - Provide a data management platform to enable
data aggregation and sharing across projects. 3) - Perform quality control and minimal preprocessing of data.
4) - Facilitate the dissemination of datasets and the reproducibility of analyses."

In 2017-2018, we worked closely with the Rwanda Ministry of Health (MOH) to develop and pilot test a theory-
based, multi-level intervention targeting postpartum family planning (PPFP) supply and demand in 5
government health facilities in Kigali, the capital. This innovative PPFP intervention is known as `C4' because it
is informed by Clients, Clinic providers, Champions, and Community Health Workers. Long-acting reversible
contraceptives (LARC), the intrauterine device (PPIUD) and implant, are fundamental to PPFP programs.
LARCs are highly effective and are the only reversible methods that may be safely used in early postpartum
period by breastfeeding women. During our pilot, LARC uptake among postpartum women increased
significantly (172% for PP implant, 2,687% for PPIUD), PPFP feasibility and acceptability were high among
providers and clients, and side-effects were rare. We now propose to use an implementation science framework
to evaluate the effectiveness of different PPFP demand creation strategies and test the hypothesis that C4 is
adaptable to large-scale implementation, cost-effective, and sustainable. In a Type 2 effectiveness-
implementation hybrid study, we will evaluate facility organizational readiness prior to implementing C4 in a
clinic randomized trial in 12 high-volume health facilities in Kigali, Rwanda (Aim 1). Adaptability and
sustainability within government facilities is a critical aspect of our proposal, and the MOH and other local
stakeholders will be engaged from the outset. We expect to deliver C4 PPFP counseling to over 21,000
women/couples during the project period. We will then evaluate C4 effectiveness and implementation
processes using RE-AIM (Aim 2). We hypothesize that C4 will significantly increase the number of
stakeholders engaged, PPFP providers and promoters, couples/clients receiving information about PPFP
(reach), and LARC uptake (effectiveness) comparing intervention versus standard of care. We expect PPFP
client satisfaction will be high and side-effects will be rare. The independent effectiveness of each demand
creation strategy on LARC uptake will be estimated. We assess measures of C4 adoption, implementation, and
maintenance at the patient-, provider- and stakeholder-level to assess C4 sustainability. Finally, we will
evaluate C4 cost-effectiveness and develop a national costed implementation plan to guide Rwandan MOH
decision-making for nationwide roll-out of PPFP services (Aim 3). We hypothesize that C4 will be cost-saving
relative to standard of care. C4 represents an important contribution to the Rwanda Family Planning 2020
goals and the MOH are enthusiastic to see our successful pilot efforts expanded to a larger number of facilities
for greater and sustained impact. Our PPFP implementation model is designed to be replicable and expandable
to other countries in the region which similarly have high unmet need for PPFP."
10815721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mucosal healing is the primary goal of all therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). No currently
approved therapy directly promotes wound healing of the bowel epithelium, which forms a single-cell barrier
between the host and lumen and regulates the immune response. The cellular and molecular mechanisms that
define the healing process remain to be defined. The intestinal crypt maintains the normal turnover of epithelial
cells within a vertical lineage hierarchy of basal stem and terminally differentiated luminal cells. During wound
healing, this lineage hierarchy is suspended, and epithelial cells can undergo dedifferentiation to mediate re-
epithelialization. In recent work, we have identified an alternate source of wound healing in the distal colon of
mice. In acute and chronic models of colitis, a skin-like cell population at the anal transition zone (ATZ),
bordering the sharp squamocolumnar anorectal junction, migrates into the colon and forms a permanent hybrid
epithelial structure called squamous neo-epithelium of colon (SNEC). SNEC represents the end-product of
wound healing by cells of the ATZ. The ATZ is an anatomically small region that is composed of a unique
population of epithelial stem cells that have a mixed colonic/epidermal phenotype and are capable of wound-
healing plasticity. Moreover, these stem cells are partially resistant to the damage of colitis. The study of these
cells could highlight new pathways for colonic epithelial regeneration in the context of IBD. However, the
lineage diversity and relationships within the myriad tissue types of the human ATZ are not known, and
furthermore it remains to be defined whether ATZ stem cells might provide enduring intestinal function, protect
from potential oncogenic sequela, or repair ulcers throughout the colon. In the proposed work, we will test
whether ATZ-derived stem cells could be suitable reagents to mediate colonic epithelial wound healing and
identify key pathways that contribute to their proliferative potential. The Specific Aims of the project are: 1) to
define regenerative cell populations in the human ATZ, 2) to define long-term outcomes of endogenous colonic
wound healing by ATZ cells, and 3) to identify mechanisms of functional ATZ plasticity in wound healing. A
deeper investigation of the mechanisms, implications, and potential translation of this noncanonical form of
colonic wound healing could reveal new therapeutic targets to direct mucosal healing in IBD."

 Recent successes of machine learning (especially deep learning) in analyzing electronic health record (EHR) data have
not only stimulated excitement in stake holders but have also raised concerns potential unfair or biased clinical decision
making facilitated by machine learning. A number of fairness measurements have been proposed. However, they
underappreciate the chronical systematic differences between the distributions of protected and unprotected groups. Hence,
when used to develop machine learning methods, they may worsen within-group issues and dampen performance of the
trained machine learning models. The situation can be further complicated by missing values that are common in EHR data,
which will exacerbate unfairness if not handled properly. In this project, we aim to develop a novel fairness evaluation
methodology (Aim 1) and incorporate it into the development of innovative machine learning models and techniques to
reduce biases and increase interpretability (Aim 2). To better and more fairly handle missing values, we will develop new
machine learning models that contain trainable in-process missing value imputation components and new algorithms to train
them with constraints defined by our new fairness evaluation method (Aim 3). In addition, we will develop proactive
machine learning techniques to advance heath equity (Aim 4). We will evaluate and improve our new fairness measurements
and machine learning techniques in the context of facilitating clinical decision making (Aim 5). Large datasets from two of
the largest US healthcare systems will be used in carrying out the proposed research."

Dengue remains stubbornly endemic in many countries. Vaccine development efforts have been hampered by
a poor understanding of the immune response. We do know that pre-existing immunity from vaccination or
historic infections is key to driving disease risk, however, accurate markers of risk or protection are lacking,
including how they change over multiple years. Less is known about the role of non-neutralizing antibody
functions, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent enhancement in driving disease
risk. Neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibody responses have not been characterized alongside cellular
immune responses that have been identified to be associated with risk of illness. Here, we will expand upon
previous work on the diversity of neutralization responses to specifically add characterization of non-neutralizing
antibody responses and cellular immune responses from natural infection and vaccination using samples taken
from the same individuals over numerous time points. These samples come from cohorts that had regular
collection of sera and PBMC and were followed for instances of infection and illness, many of which severe. This
includes a cohort of individuals that were vaccinated by the only licensed dengue vaccine, a cohort followed for
13 years. We also have access to samples from individuals vaccinated with another candidate vaccine followed
over five years. Finally, we will re-recruit cohort participants to provide samples 23 years after their participation
to investigate long term responses after infections. We will measure multiple non-neutralizing and neutralizing
responses to a diverse set of dengue viruses a wide range of antibody measures as well as a limited set of
cellular immune responses, providing a multi-dimensional, systems characterization of humoral and cellular
immune responses. We will use this multi-dimensional measure and mathematical models to reconstruct full
infection histories and immune dynamics. These efforts will provide a set of correlates of protection/risk of illness
and infection that can be used to assess risk in vaccine trials and epidemiological studies. These mechanistic
models will be generally useful to infer dynamics of immune responses to antigenically variable pathogens and
can be used to assist in the design and analysis of vaccine trials and epidemiological studies.
Relevance to Public Health
Multiple candidate dengue vaccines are currently in development, however, their likely effectiveness over short
and long time periods remain unknown due to a lack of good markers of protection or risk. Identifying such
markers, and how they change over time is critical to their optimal use, continued efficacy and population safety.
More broadly, characterization of non-neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to a diverse set of
dengue viruses alongside neutralizing responses in humans followed over many years who have experienced
dengue infection and/or vaccination will increase our understanding of immune responses to dengue."

Human genome is peppered with an estimated one million enhancers that can regulate their specific target
gene(s) from a distance up to megabases away, and in an orientation-independent manner. The broad goal of
this project is to define the fundamental architecture and function of human enhancers in a in-depth manner
and to better understand the specificity of their interplay with different classes of promoters that use different
transcription factors and/or are regulated at distinct steps in transcription. We have shown that enhancers can
be identified and precisely mapped using our GRO/PRO-cap assay that map transcription start sites of nascent
RNA with highest sensitivity of all available methods. This assay has shown that both enhancers and
promoters share a common architecture whereby both are delimited by two divergent core promoters (CPs)
and a central cluster of transcription factor (TF) binding motifs. The roles and required organization of the
multiple sequence motifs that constitute enhancers and the two CPs need to be fully dissected to understand
how active enhancers function. Additionally, enhancers can interact productively with specific promoters, and
the basis of this specificity especially at long range remains ill-defined. Finally, we know that promoter and
enhancer elements have sequence motifs that can act at distinct regulatory steps of the transcription cycle, but
how these activities coordinate gene regulation has yet to be examined. In Aim 1, we will test the activity of all
PRO-cap identified enhancer candidates in K562 from representative human Chromosomes 8 and 11 with a
carefully chosen set of promoters harboring distinct regulatory features. A set of active enhancer-promoter
combinations will then be subjected to a comprehensive motif mutagenesis of the central clusters of TF binding
motifs and each of the two core promoters. These studies test our fundamental enhancer unit hypothesis and
assess the relationships of enhancers to targeted promoters, and the role of specific motifs and sequence
features in enhancer function. In Aim 2, we examine quantitatively enhancers and key mutants identified in
Aim 1 by barcoding and integrating WT and mutant enhancers 5 kb upstream of their normally responsive
promoter in a chromosomal context at the AAVS1 safe harbor locus. These assays will rigorously test function
of enhancer motifs, core promoters, and the overall architecture of enhancers in a constant chromosomal
background. In addition, we will also test the regulatory code underlying enhancer specificity for promoters and
evaluate effects of mutant TF motifs on TF binding and on nascent transcription using targeted genomic
assays. Finally, in Aim 3, we explore the ability of enhancers to act over long distances, using the NMU
enhancer (eNMU), which resides 94 kb upstream of the NMU promoter and stimulates its transcription by
10,000-fold. We will utilize this robust model enhancer, which is not confounded by redundant/shadow
enhancers at the native locus, to establish a novel long-range, chromosomal, massively-parallel reporter
system using a landing pad at the eNMU locus and characterize functional motifs of eNMU by mutagenesis."

 Norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (Epi) have been implicated in complex cognitive functions,
such as sensory processing, sleep-wake/arousal state transition and attention, in the brain, and other
biological processes in various tissues and organs, including the heart, pancreas and spleen.
Dysregulation of adrenergic transmission is linked to a number of neurological diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease, depressive disorders and schizophrenia, as well as many other health problems,
including cardiovascular diseases, immune-deficiency and tumorigenesis.
 Despite the potential involvement of NE/Epi in myriad physiological and pathological conditions,
the precise regulation and exact functional role of adrenergic transmission remain poorly defined, due
primarily to limitations of available tools for monitoring NE/Epi. We have recently developed a family
of intensity-based G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation-based genetically encoded NE
(GRABNE) sensors by coupling a circular permutated green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) with a human
adrenergic receptor. While these GRABNE sensors allowed the first visualization of adrenergic
transmission, the sensors were suboptimal in determining synaptic properties of adrenergic
transmission. To facilitate NE/Epi research, we recently engineered high-performance GRABNE
sensors that allowed high-sensitivity and high-resolution visualization of adrenergic transmission events
at single release sites. The new sensors and preliminary data build up our confidence to test the
hypothesis that high-performance GRABNE sensors may resolve the adrenergic transmission
properties that could deduce the adrenergic functional role. This application follows two specific
aims: Aim 1 is to determine whether high-performance GRABNE sensors may resolve adrenergic
transmission properties, and Aim 2 is to test whether adrenergic transmission plays an essential role in
the precision- and attention-demanding behaviors. We expect the proposed experiments to
characterize the first set of fundamental synaptic properties of a new form of neuronal transmission and
define a novel, unique functional role for adrenergic transmission."

This proposal aims to use innovative advances in sodium MRI (NaMRI) and proton (1H) diffusion MRI to identify
imaging biomarkers of disease in patients with Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI). NaMRI provides unique in
vivo ionic information about the brain, though has historically been plagued by low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
limiting its utility in studying clinical populations. However, recent technological advances proposed here allow
translation to clinical groups such as patients with MTBI. MTBI is a major public health problem yet the underlying
pathophysiology remains a mystery and ionic imbalance including sodium dysregulation has been implicated in
the disease in cell and animal experiments as well as preliminary studies in human subjects. Quantifying brain
sodium in MTBI and finding NaMRI biomarkers for disease is particularly exciting as this could shed light on the
mechanism of injury in MTBI and open the door to the development of new treatment pathways which are badly
needed. Furthermore, there are promising results from cellular and animal models of MTBI using selective
sodium channel blockade that mitigate damage relating to injury, suggesting sodium plays a central but as yet
unexplored role in the pathophysiology of MTBI.
Our team’s combined strengths in innovative and cutting-edge NaMRI methods, diffusion microstructure imaging,
and MTBI will allow us to meet the goals of this project. We propose to leverage technical advances that make
NaMRI clinically feasible at 3.0T, including work from our group in multinuclear coil design, image acquisition,
image reconstruction and data analysis. The work specifically seeks to quantify NaMRI signal to 1) characterize
changes after injury, 2) explore the link between known white matter compromise and altered brain sodium in
conjunction with advanced diffusion MRI and 3) determine if sodium mediates the relationship between
microstructural changes and clinical symptoms. Identifying surrogate imaging biomarkers to better quantify injury
and recovery will allow development of objective return-to-activities recommendations, address the need to
develop methods to predict risk for prolonged symptoms, and point to new pathways for therapy."
10914777,"Most discoveries of the genetic basis of Alzheimer disease (AD) were made in Caucasians of European ancestry
(EAs) and required samples between 10,000 and 150,000 subjects to detect them. We and others have
demonstrated that discovery of AD risk variants can be accomplished in more genetically homogeneous cohorts
comprising several thousand or fewer subjects. Studies of non-EA populations also afford the opportunity to
discover variants that are relatively rare or absent in EAs and that display a smaller effect size in EAs due to
modification by other genes and environmental factors. We will focus on Jews and Arabs currently living in Israel
who are descended from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Although MENA Jews assimilated to some
extent with their non-Jewish neighbors, they have maintained a distinctive genetic profile that reflects some
admixture with non-Jews, ancient Jewish background, and a unique component reflecting genetic drift and new
mutations during the last two millennia. Our previous studies of Arabs living in the Israeli village called Wadi Ara
revealed a genome-wide significant association for AD with ACE, were central to the establishment of SORL1
as an AD gene, and contributed to a trans-ethnic GWAS leading to the discovery of several novel AD genes. In
this project, we will leverage the genetic architecture of MENA Jews and Israeli-Arabs, as well as their distinctive
environmental exposures and lifestyles, to promote discovery of AD-related genes and variants. Specifically, we
will recruit 3,000 MENA Jews at three sites in Israel, as well as 1,000 Israeli-Arabs located in multiple villages
(equal numbers of AD cases and controls in the total sample). We will obtain from each participant a blood
specimen for DNA and biomarker studies, and phenotypic data including clinical, cognitive test, medical history
and lifestyle information, as well as brain MRI data for a portion of the sample. DNA specimens will be whole
genome sequenced (WGS). WGS data will be processed using pipelines established by the Alzheimer Disease
Sequencing Project (ADSP). We will conduct a GWAS for AD using admixture mapping and methods for single
variant and gene-based tests. Top-findings will be replicated in Ashkenazi Jewish and non-Jewish datasets
assembled by the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium and ADSP using trans-ethnic analysis and
approaches that focus on variants affecting protein structure, transcription, and gene expression. We will also
conduct GWAS for age at onset and AD biomarkers using single outcome and pleiotropy models. Next, we will
identify gene targets of the top-ranked SNPs by performing expression quantitative trait locus analysis using
locally derived and publicly available data containing genotype and gene expression data in brain and other
tissues, and establish functional connections among the top-ranked SNPs and genes using pathway, co-
expression network, and Mendelian randomization analysis. Finally, we will evaluate the association of viruses
detected in WGS data with AD using machine learning methods and regression models. We expect that this
project will identify novel targets for development of effective drugs to treat or retard processes leading to AD."

10861776,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental knowledge gap and missed opportunities due to the current lack of understanding of
the relationship between age-related risk factors, such as loss of both global and pelvic skeletal muscle
function, and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among older women and men. LUTS are associated with
functional impairment and poor quality of life and are at increased risk of falls, fractures, and mortality. The
current narrow focus on urinary tract pathology has led to minimal understanding of what causes these
symptoms and correspondingly few effective interventions. A new aging-focused paradigm of LUTS
pathophysiology could lead to novel interventions to treat LUTs by defining modifiable LUTS risk factors, such
as age-related changes in muscle health, and mechanisms shared across syndromes of aging.
My goals are to build an epidemiologic backbone for understanding age-related LUTS risk factors by
leveraging high-quality existing data, defining novel and modifiable risk factors and mechanisms for age-
related LUTS, and to lead subsequent translational efforts to target these risk factors and mechanisms in older
adults. The objective of this application is to evaluate longitudinal associations between multiple measures of
skeletal muscle and LUTS. My hypothesis is that age-related changes in skeletal muscle – at the system
(strength and physical performance), organ (muscle mass/volume), and cellular (mitochondrial bioenergetics)
level – are associated with LUTS severity, independent of chronological age and confounding factors.
This hypothesis will be tested by efficiently using data from the prospective cohort “Study of Muscle Mobility
and Aging” (SOMMA) to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) Determine how baseline and longitudinal
changes in muscle function (strength, power) and physical performance (walking speed) are associated with
change in LUTS severity; Aim 2) Determine how baseline and longitudinal changes in muscle mass and
baseline measures of both total body and pelvic floor muscle volume and shape are associated with change in
LUTS severity; and Aim 3) Determine how baseline measures of skeletal muscle mitochondrial function are
associated with change in LUTS severity. This project is innovative because it leverages the rapidly evolving
field of geroscience to improve the inadequate existing urogenital-focused paradigm of LUTS pathophysiology.
The proposed research is significant because it will produce a paradigm of age-related LUTS pathophysiology
that will result in improved care for older adults with LUTS by 1) identifying biomarkers of age-related LUTS; 2)
improving the benefit:risk ratio for existing therapies by stratifying based on novel LUTS phenotypes; 3)
distinguishing the role of changes in global versus pelvic floor muscles in the development of LUTS; 4)
facilitating the development of new treatments that target age-related LUTS mechanisms; and ultimately 5)
preventing LUTS complications (e.g., frailty, impaired mobility, falls, and poor quality of life) that may be directly
caused by LUTS or indirectly caused by shared modifiable factors for which LUTS is an early marker."
10804667,"Background: The VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program (VASQIP) predicts risk for important
postoperative outcomes and shares process improvements from high performance sites with lower
performance sites to continuously improve surgical outcomes. The VASQIP was so successful it was
implemented in the private sector and continues today. The proposed research will add pharmacogenomic
data from the Million Veterans Program (MVP) to the VASQIP. In addition, the VASQIP is collaborating with
the VA National Artificial Intelligence Institute (NAII) to add more phenotype data from other VA databases
including VASQIP, Centralized Interactive Phenomics Resource (CIPHER), VA Informatics and Computing
Infrastructure (VINCI), and the Corporate Data Warehouse. This phenotype data will also be added to the
VASQIP and machine learning/ artificial intelligence will be used to update the VASQIP in a separate project
that will be done in parallel.
Significance: Pharmacogenomics examines an individual person’s genes that affect drug metabolism, drug
target, drug transport, or drug immune response and the impact on adverse drug events and treatment
effectiveness. Pharmacogenomics can explain the variation in treatment response that is commonly seen in
clinical practice. Pharmacogenomics has been associated with both worse and improved outcomes and cost
effectiveness in a number of clinical settings. Pharmacogenomic data is included on 499 FDA drug labels.
Despite this acknowledgement of the benefits of Pharmacogenomic testing, such testing is not routinely
completed within the VA in general, and not for surgery specifically.
Innovation & Impact: There are several innovative approaches to the proposed research. Applying
pharmacogenomic data to surgical outcomes, using machine learning and artificial intelligence to add
phenotypic data to the VASQIP program with the goal of rapidly implementing the results into patient care to
optimize patient centered decision making and outcomes are all innovative.
Specific Aims: 1) Identify pharmacogenomic risk associations with outcomes among individuals receiving
vascular surgery and cardiac surgery the past 10 years for established (tier 1 and 2) drug/ gene sets. 2)
Identify pharmacogenomic risk associations with outcomes among individuals receiving vascular surgery and
cardiac surgery the past 10 years for non-established (tier 3) drug/ gene sets. 3) Assess frequency of study
drug usage and presence of pharmacogenomic genes for power modeling future studies. 4) Identify high-risk
subgroups that may benefit from pharmacogenomic testing.
Methodology: This is a retrospective cohort study that will use the standard VASQIP variables and outcomes.
Baseline analysis will use linear regression or Cox’s proportional hazards model and will control for patient
baseline characteristics and surgical factors using propensity scores with matching or inverse weighting.
Machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks, classification and regression trees, or ensemble
learning will be used to improve predictions and account for nonlinear relationships and interactions among
the potentially large set of pharmacogenomic features.
Next Steps/Implementation: The results of the proposed research will be used to update all VASQIP
surgeries, then field implementation can occur for real time clinical decision support. High risk patient
subgroups will be identified that would benefit from preoperative pharmacogenomic testing and further
intervention studies."
10899705,"Project Summary/Abstract: Despite advances in the identification of risk factors and use of evidence-based
strategies to manage cardiovascular (CV) diseases, recent declines in mortality have stalled and race/ethnic

laboratory, clinical, or population studies into clinical applications, while implementation research promotes the
integration of research findings and evidence-based interventions into healthcare policy, public health and
clinical settings. A well-trained and diverse workforce of translation and implementation scientists who can test
innovative ideas and advance the adoption and practice of proven therapies are sorely needed in Louisiana

that can tackle CV health disparities in the region. The Tulane University training program for Diversity in
tRanslation and Implementation research in cardioVascular disEase (DRIVE) will draw on the expertise of
outstanding investigators to provide trainees from underrepresented backgrounds with the didactics,
experience, skills, mentoring and resources they need to become successful researchers in CV translation and
implementation sciences. The program will provide in-depth, structured training support for eight predoctoral
candidates from diverse and underserved backgrounds, leveraging outstanding investigators and on-going
translational research in CV clinical trials (T3) and community-based implementation studies (T4). The DRIVE
training program will be rooted in multidisciplinary team science with integration of junior and senior mentors to
guide the trainee via their Individualized Development Plan in acquiring critical skills and applying these skills
in hands-on research experiences to address CV health disparities across Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta
region. The program director will be assisted by an executive operating committee and a committee of external
advisors from underrepresented backgrounds with exceptional research careers and experience in mentoring.
Mentors will use defined and proven methods to enhance the development and success of the trainees, while
all trainees will participate in a series of workshops that teach grant writing, manuscript writing and professional
development skills, including best practice strategies to optimize presentations, communications and
networking. The proposed training program seeks to contribute to diversifying the translation and
implementation workforce, reducing the burden of CV diseases and metabolic risk factors, eliminating health
disparities, and improving health equity in Louisiana and the nation."

The recurrence of periodontal disease (PD) is a poorly immunologically defined or therapeutically targeted
clinical challenge. Uncovering the homeostatic and pathogenic potential of long-term immune cells in
periodontal tissues is crucial to revealing the cellular drivers of PD recurrence. This proposal focuses on
an overlooked periodontal-associated cellular compartment, CD4+ T memory cells (TM), which can readily
recognize microbial antigens for a quick and robust response. For this purpose, we will utilize a newly
characterized murine model of recurrent PD and a method for gingival T-cell enrichment. In this model,
time is a critical variable for recognizing disease initiation, resolution, and recurrence. By establishing this
model, we will be able to define a “recovered” baseline instead of a “healthy” baseline state, which is more
clinically accurate. Also, it allows defining how multiple relapse episodes incrementally impact the complex
periodontally-associated immune network. The preliminary studies revealed that CD4+ TM developed in the
gingiva soon after birth due to increasing environmental antigenic exposure. While the mice fully recovered
from ligature-induced PD, the bone loss rate accelerated during PD recurrence. Most intriguingly, CD4+ TM
subtypes are enriched in the gingiva during PD recurrence. Gingival CD4+ tissue-resident memory cells
induced bone loss when circulating T cell infiltration was inhibited. Based on these findings, we will test the
hypothesis that the PD-induced generation and persistence of CD4+ TM subtypes determine PD
recurrence. Thus, targeted depletion of these cells by inhibiting metabolic checkpoints will enhance
immune-regulatory responses and inhibit PD recurrence. There are three interconnected but independent
Aims: 1) To identify the spatiotemporal development of CD4+ TM cells in periodontal tissues. Here, the
focus will be on understanding the constitutive and pathologic generation of CD4+ TM cells to determine
their roles in the gingival immune landscape. 2) To elucidate PD-induced CD4+ TM pathogenicity. Here, we
will evaluate which CD4+ TM subtypes retain pro-inflammatory and osteoclastogenic programming after
PD. We will make transcriptomic comparisons between CD4+ TM subtypes and assess the findings with ex
vivo functional assays to validate their pathogenic potential. 3) To develop an intervention strategy for CD4+
TM depletion to prevent PD recurrence. Here, we will employ a metabolic-based strategy to selectively
deplete PD-induced CD4+ TM and enhance regulatory T cells enrichment to prevent PD recurrence. The
independence award (PAR-22-041) will foster my independent research growth and allow me to accomplish
my long-term career goal to become a productive, independent translational scientist in periodontology and
related fields focused on chronic diseases’ recurrence."
10845638,"Self-directed violence (SDV), defined as anything a person does intentionally that can cause injury to one's
self, including death (i.e., suicide attempt, suicide ideation, non-suicidal self-injury), is a significant public health
issue. A growing number of SDV prevention programs train adults and peers (termed “gatekeeper training”) to
be more active bystanders– to try to help when they see someone who may be at risk for self-injury. Such
programs have demonstrated positive changes in knowledge and attitudes about suicide, but have had less
success in changing behaviors in real world settings. Limited impact may be due to the absence of longitudinal
research on how SDV bystander actions unfold and what attitudes and barriers influence bystanders' behavior.
A recent national survey of 1,031 youth and young adults conducted by this research team to inform the
current proposal revealed that 83.1% have been exposed to SDV in their lifetimes. While this suggests great
opportunity for interventions focused on bystanders, studies also document the mental health impact of those
exposed to SDV (i.e., “bystanders”). Indeed, lifetime exposure to suicidal behavior is associated with past
month trauma symptoms, suicide ideation, and thoughts of self-harm among youth. Also, we have surprisingly
limited information about how these bystanders are impacted by the help they provide. In the interpersonal
violence field, research suggests that the feelings of bystanders about their intervention are influenced by the
way their actions were received by the other person. Given research on the contagion of SDV among young
people, extending this research to SDV bystanders is critical. Further, exposure to SDV may be amplifying
existing mental health disparities experienced by sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations. Youth with
SGM identities experience elevated rates of suicidal behavior and associated risk factors including depression,
substance use, and peer victimization because of discrimination and structural inequalities. The negative
impacts of SDV exposure noted above may amplify these disparities. New and innovative approaches are
clearly needed to help narrow these gaps in SDV risk and exposures among SGM and other minority
populations. To address these gaps, we propose to conduct a national longitudinal study of youth, ages 13-22.
Participants will be recruited via social media to facilitate a national reach and oversampling of SGM youth.
Specific Aims are informed by the research team's prior work, previous research about interpersonal violence
bystander behavior, and guided by the Enhanced Social Cognitive Model for SDV (ESC-SDV). Specifically, we
will: 1) Recruit and survey a cohort of 5,000 adolescents and young adults to identify the pathways through
which attitudinal and contextual components of the ESC-SDV predict: a) opportunity to act, b) intent to act, and
c) actual bystander behavior for SDV; 2) Survey these youth two more times, 12 months apart, to identify the
impact of bystander behavior on the bystanders themselves; and 3) Examine how these trends are different for
important subgroups of youth."
10774293,"Project Summary Abstract
Mosquitoes infect hundreds of millions of people with deadly pathogens every year. Since mosquitoes
identify humans and other important resources primarily via their sense of smell, the disruption of
mosquito olfactory systems has long been recognized as a potential strategy for controlling these
pathogens. For example, repellants that scramble or block the detection of odors may be used to push
mosquitoes away from humans and the areas where we live and work. Conversely, irresistibly attractive
blends of volatile chemicals may be deployed to pull mosquitoes into lethal traps. Despite some
advances in this area over the past decade, progress has been limited by the fact that the olfactory
systems of our most important vector mosquitoes remain largely uncharacterized. We know that
mosquitoes detect odors using tens to hundreds of ligand-specific olfactory receptors expressed in
approximately 60 different types of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) found on their antennae and
maxillary palps. But we don’t yet know exactly which neurons mosquitoes rely on for detecting humans,
flowers, and oviposition sites, nor which receptors are expressed in those neurons. Moreover, exciting
preliminary data from our lab and others indicates that the 1-to-1 matching between receptors and
sensory neurons observed in Drosophila vinegar flies does not apply in mosquitoes. Instead, mosquito
sensory neurons appear to express multiple, ligand-specific receptors. This means that the tuning of the
neurons that drive behavior cannot be equated to the tuning of individual receptors and thus helps to
explain why previous receptor-focused studies have largely failed to unlock the logic of mosquito host
attraction. Here, we propose to characterize the molecular and functional properties of all major OSN cell
types on the antennae of the arbovirus vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. In Aim 1, we will conduct single-
nucleus RNA sequencing of antennal neurons to identify putative OSN cell types and the receptors
expressed therein. In Aim 2, we will use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate OSN type-specific
expression drivers that can be used to match OSN types to their target glomeruli in the antennal lobe of
the brain. In Aim 3, we will use in vivo antennal lobe imaging to characterize the tuning of a subset of
OSN types to a panel of 200-300 biologically relevant odorants and natural blends. Taken together we
expect to generate a receptor-neuron-glomerulus map for this important disease vector and a library of
genetic tools with which to manipulate it—facilitating the identification of the neurons that drive behavior
and opening the door to the efficient and rational design of chemical repellants and attractants for use in
vector control."
10911011,"ABSTRACT
A key problem in substance use disorders (SUD) is their etiological and functional heterogeneity, which is not
well captured by the current psychiatric nosology. An influential neuroscience-based heuristic framework,
Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA), proposes that to address this heterogeneity, the assessment of
addictions should be multi-dimensional and focus on three key domains: executive function (EF), incentive
salience (IS), and negative emotionality (NE), assessed with comprehensive batteries of self-report and
neurobehavioral tasks. While computational tools have increased the knowledge extracted from these tasks,
there are surprisingly few high-quality assays for monitoring and characterizing these domains. The burden of
administration of current assessment batteries may take up to 10 hours and most assessment instruments lack
precision in identifying underlying etiological mechanisms. Critically, most neurobehavioral and neuroimaging
tasks have low test-retest reliability, which limits their utility for biomarker discovery. To address these limitations,
we propose to apply Bayesian adaptive design optimization (ADO; Myung & Pitt, 2009) to established tasks that
index the three ANA domains, with the goal of developing rapid, robust, and reliable neurobehavioral probes of
these domains. ADO is a general-purpose computational machine-learning algorithm that optimizes data
collection and extracts the maximal information from participant responses in the fewest possible trials. Our
preliminary data show that ADO led to 0.95 or higher test-retest reliability of the delay discounting rate in under
1-2 minutes of testing, captured approximately 10% more variance in test-retest reliability, and was 3-5 times
more precise and 3-8 times more efficient than conventional assessment methods (Ahn et al., 2020). The current
study proposes to develop and evaluate a battery of ADO-based tasks, software, and mobile apps using state-
of-the-science computational approaches that will significantly reduce the time for neurocognitive task
administration, while increasing task reliability, precision, and efficiency. To capture the heterogeneity of
addiction, this battery will be tested with neurotypical individuals and several diverse populations with different
types of SUD (opioid, stimulant, alcohol, and tobacco) in three countries (USA, South Korea, Bulgaria) where
we have developed infrastructure for this type of research. This value-added perspective would be useful for out-
of-sample validation of our models and allow us to address not only the generalizability of the ANA domains to
different types of SUD, but also the cross-cultural generalizability of the domains, which has not been examined.
The specific aims of the study are to: (1) Develop a battery of reliable and efficient ADO-based neurobehavioral
tasks of the ANA domains and assess its test-retest reliability in neurotypical individuals; (2) Assess the predictive
utility of the newly developed ADO tasks for SUD outcomes by testing patients with different types of SUD; and
(3) Design web-based platforms and mobile apps for measuring cognition with the newly developed ADO tasks,
and open-source software platforms with the ADO and other computational methods we develop."
10906260,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed research and training in this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award application are
intended to help the PI, Dr. Christian Vazquez Ph.D., become a prolific NIA-funded researcher that works with
underserved aging Latino communities to improve their health by maximizing their use of eHealth and increasing
eHealth literacy. The proposed work responds to NIA’s Health Disparities Research Framework to focus on
strategies to increase the inclusion of underrepresented populations in aging research. Candidate: The PI is an
Assistant Professor at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) School of Social Work. The PI’s research is
focused on the intersection of aging, Latinos, and eHealth. This area is timely given the racial/ethnic inequities
highlighted during COVID as the use of technology in health became ubiquitous. The PI’s long-term goal is to
become a leader in the development and implementation of eHealth interventions with Spanish-speaking Latinos
in the US, via consistent funding from NIA. Environment: UTA provides all the resources commonly found at
Research 1 universities to aid in the completion of the proposed studies. UTA also provides a rich environment for
formal and informal training in career development. Research: The proposed research covers three aims. In aim
1, the PI will identify barriers between Spanish-preferred older adults and use of eHealth by carrying out: 1a) a
systematic literature review on the topic of eHealth interventions with US-based Spanish-speaking Latinos and 1b)
a qualitative study using Photovoice method, in which participants will take photos to answer: What are examples
of successful health information communication? Spanish-preferred older adult Latinos will take photos of health
information they see on TV, online, in a doctor’s office, etc. to provide their perspective on what health information
communication patterns may be useful in eHealth training. Aim 2 includes culturally and linguistically adapting an
evidence-based English-language intervention to increase older adults’ eHealth literacy. The adaptation will focus
on cultural factors such as religion, family, forms of respect, and Latino diversity (e.g., country of origin, length of
time in the US). In aim 3, The PI will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the adapted intervention with Spanish-
preferred older adult Latinos. Career Development: This award will support the PI’s career development by building
on his existing training in Latino health disparities and quantitative methods. The career development plan includes
mentored training, didactic coursework, and other career development opportunities guided by three training goals:
a) understand barriers to Spanish-speaking older adults’ engagement in eHealth and eHealth interventions, b)
learn how to culturally adapt an English-language intervention for Spanish-preferred older adults, and c) learn to
implement and assess feasibility and acceptability of an adapted intervention. Combined with a rigorous training
plan, working with top experts in the fields of aging, Latino/a health, implementation science, and technology-based
intervention development, this proposal will generate novel data to justify a future R01 proposal to advance aging
research with underrepresented populations and assess the efficacy of the intervention with a larger sample."
10839844,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The overarching goal of this application is to identify novel mechanisms by which enteroviruses infect the human
intestinal epithelium. The events associated with enterovirus infections of the human intestinal epithelium remain
largely unknown, largely due to the lack of suitable in vivo models that recapitulate the enteral route of infection
in an immunocompetent setting and the inability of standard cultured cells to recapitulate the multicellular nature
of the GI epithelium. Using two parallel three-dimensional (3-D) cell models of the human intestinal epithelium
recently developed in our laboratory, including a primary stem cell-based model, we have identified several
unique mechanisms used by enteroviruses to infect the GI epithelium. The studies proposed in this application
will provide important insights into (1) the role of non-lytic release in the enterovirus life cycle in the human
intestinal epithelium, (2) the impact of enterovirus infections on intestinal epithelial structure and function, and
(3) the role of epithelial host interferon signaling in the control of enteroviral infections. These goals are premised
on the central hypothesis that intestinal cell-associated pathways directly impact enterovirus pathogenesis in the
human GI tract. Our proposal pioneers research into a variety of aspects of the molecular mechanisms of
enterovirus-GI cell interactions. Notably, our research will also illuminate virus specific-pathogenic pathways,
which may explain why some enteroviruses are relatively well-tolerated, and others cause severe disease. Given
our extensive expertise in enterovirus research, specifically studies related to the GI tract, we are uniquely
positioned to perform these studies, which will provide new paradigms for our understanding of enterovirus
infections of the GI epithelium."
10864027,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Discrete populations of neurons in the hypothalamus (including the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH) and
medulla (rostroventral lateral medulla, RVLM) of the brain densely innervate the spinal cord, and regulate renal
sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). Via these neurons, the brain regulates salt balance, renin release and both renal
plasma flow (RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in health, and they may play a significant role in chronic
hypertension and, in the setting of sudden stress (acute kidney injury). Many brain neurons regulating kidney
function project from PVH and RVLM to the T8 - T12 intermediolateral column (IML) region in the spinal cord,
synapsing on most of the preganglionic sympathetic fibers which in turn drive renal sympathetic nerve activity
(renal SNA). Some PVH neurons which regulate renal function project to RVLM. Because each of these brain
regions has many neuron subpopulations which regulate a wide array of somatic functions, we must apply new
approaches and tools to identify and characterize those neuron subpopulations which participate in controlling
renal function. To achieve this goal this multi-PI R01 proposal brings together a strong group of neuroscientists
and renal physiologists to apply these approaches and tools. At BIDMC we have been using RNASeq and NucSeq
methods to develop expression atlases of PVH and RVLM neuron subpopulations. At Pittsburgh we have been
determining which PVH and RVLM neurons connect polysynaptically to the kidney using pseudorabiesvirus
(PRV) injections into the kidney. The proposed studies will identify PVH and RVLM neuron subpopulations
which drive renal SNA and regulate renal function. For PVH (Aim 1a) we will identify neuron subpopulations
which project to T8 – T12 and RVLM using AAVretro injections into T8 – T12 and RVLM to label nuclei of neuron
subpopulations which project to these regions, followed by FACS sorting and NucSeq. These newly identify
subpopulations will be validated to polysynaptically innervate the kidney using a kidney injection of the
transsynaptic tracer pseudorabies virus and in situ hybridization. In Aim 1b, we will optogenetically stimulate
these subpopulations of PVH neurons projecting to T8 – T12 or to RVLM and determine the impact on renal
SNA, renin secretion, Na+/electrolyte balance, renal plasma flow (RPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and
arterial blood pressure (ABP). Aim 2a will construct an RNASeq atlas for RVLM using NucSeq and validate that
these subpopulations innervate the kidney using pseudorabies virus and in situ hybridization. Aim 2b will
determine the effect of optogenetic stimulation of bulbospinal C1 and non-C1 RVLM neurons on various aspects
of renal function. These studies will identify novel subpopulations of neurons in these critical brain
regions that control renal function, which neurons connect to them and likely regulate their
activity, and how their activity is altered in disease states. The proposed studies will open the way
for a detailed understanding of how the brain controls renal function in health and disease."

Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) microscopy and accompanying automated image analysis is a widely
used technique which allows for the assessment and visualization of the tumor immune microenvironment
(TIME). Generally, mIF data has been used to simply examine the presence and abundance of immune cells in
cancer patients; however, this aggregate measure assumes uniform patterns of immune cells and overlooks
spatial heterogeneity. The spatial contexture of the TIME has not been adequately explored, in part due to the
lack of available analytical approaches and tools. Therefore, the goal of this research is to develop novel
statistical methods and software for the downstream analysis of mIF data. We will apply these methods to the
study of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the US, to develop an
immunoscore predictive of survival among EOC patients. Aim 1 is focused on developing spatial statistical
approaches for the analysis of mIF data which leverages the spatial architecture of the TIME. Aim 2 will
develop Bayesian models for the analysis of mIF data which accounts for the zero-inflated and over-dispersed
nature of the immune count data for determination of immune subtypes. Lastly, Aim 3 will characterize the
immune landscape of ovarian tumors and develop an immunoscore (Oimmuno) predictive of survival using
existing mIF data from ~2,500 diverse EOC patients enrolled in established epidemiological studies. We will
validate the Oimmuno by generating targeted mIF data in two independent cohorts, each with more than 1,200
EOC patients. In summary, this proposal will develop and test novel statistical methods for the analysis of mIF
data that incorporates the spatial heterogeneity of the TIME, in addition to abundance measures of immune
cells, producing freely available software that can be used in the study of EOC or adapted for use in other
cancer types. The derivation of methods to quantify the spatial contexture of immune cells has important
applications as such biomarker discovery for predictors of outcomes and therapeutic efficacy in cancer
patients, ultimately reducing cancer mortality."

Working memory (WM) is a core component of executive function. WM is impaired in conditions that affect
roughly 20M people in the US alone, including Alzheimer’s disease (5.8M), Parkinson’s disease (1.2M),
schizophrenia (1.5M), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (6.1M) and autism spectrum disorders (7.3M).
Despite this, there are few non-addictive medical treatments that are effective in ameliorating working memory
deficits. Focused ultrasound (FUS) is an emerging noninvasive method of brain stimulation that has the ability
to reach deep brain structures. FUS has been used for direct neuromodulation and to open the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) for targeted drug delivery. The proposed experiments will test the effects of FUS
neuromodulation and drug delivery on working memory performance in awake, behaving nonhuman primates
(NHP) as a step toward developing novel therapies for dementia. The experiments will also address the
mechanism of action of FUS neuromodulation and BBB opening in cortico-striatal circuits using a suite of MRI
methods (BOLD, DTI, UTE, pcASL, and qBOLD). Finally, we will address the safety of FUS neuromodulation
and BBB opening in cortical and deep brain structures; this has not been done previously and establishing
safety in NHP is a critical step prior to a clinical trial. We have demonstrated that FUS can be used to improve
behavioral performance during decision making in NHP and now propose to evaluate FUS for improving WM.
Aim 1 will test the effects of FUS neuromodulation alone on working memory capacity and span in intact and
impaired NHP, and compare FUS to electrical deep brain stimulation. Aim 2 will test the effects of FUS-
mediated blood-brain barrier opening and drug delivery and on working memory. Aim 3 will investigate the
mechanism of FUS neuromodulation using noninvasive MRI. Broader Impact: This project will provide
preclinical safety and efficacy data for human neuromodulation studies focusing on cognitive deficits
associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders."

Human morbidity and mortality due to tuberculosis (TB), caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), continue to be of significant health concern throughout the world. Bacille Calmette-Guerin
(BCG) still remains the only approved vaccine against TB. Although BCG is considered safe and partially
effective against extra-pulmonary childhood TB, its ability to protect against childhood and adult pulmonary TB
is still questionable. In addition, there is a concern that BCG does not induce long lasting immune responses in
the immunized individuals. However, our findings with Mtb- and BCG- derived recombinant vaccines strongly
suggest that BCG can be improved to be more efficacious against TB.
 The goal of this proposal is to improve BCG by rationally deleting genes. We plan to sequentially delete
three genes of BCG namely sapM, zmp1 and nuoG, through homologous recombination, to result in a triple
knockout BCG (BCG-TKO) strain. These genes encode proteins that enable BCG to evade host immune
response by preventing phagosome-lysosomal fusion, autophagy, apoptosis and other related processes in the
antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells and macrophages. We hypothesize that deletion of
these genes will allow the BCG-TKO strain to be efficiently processed by APCs, which will lead to increased
antigen presentation to the immune cells and enhanced in vivo immunogenicity and efficacy. Additionally, we
anticipate that deletion of these genes will reduce the virulence of the BCG, thus making the BCG-TKO to be
HIV safe. We plan to accomplish our goal with three aims: 1) construct a BCG-TKO strain through homologous
recombination, 2) analyze the immunogenicity and safety of the BCG-TKO strain in a SCID mouse model, and
3) investigate the efficacy of the BCG-TKO in the regular and humanized mouse models with and without HIV
infection. Overall, we expect that this proposal will produce a highly efficacious, third generation BCG vaccine
against TB that will be suitable for administration even in HIV infected infants."

Cisplatin is a widely-used and effective drug that is used to treat a variety of cancers. Cisplatin has several
significant side effects, including permanent hearing loss (ototoxicity), which reduces quality of life for cancer
survivors and can be dose limiting. There is a major unmet clinical need for therapies that reduce cisplatin-induced hearing loss without compromising the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. Our published work in animal
models suggests that statins, a class of FDA-approved drugs that are commonly used to manage
hypercholesterolemia, reduce cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Retrospective data in humans undergoing
cisplatin therapy to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) indicate that subjects taking
atorvastatin had significantly reduced cisplatin-induced hearing loss compared to those not taking any statin
drug. This study is a multi-site, randomized, placebo-controlled interventional trial designed to determine the
extent to which atorvastatin reduces cisplatin-induced hearing loss in patients with head and neck cancer. As
primary objective, we will determine the extent to which atorvastatin reduces the incidence and severity of
cisplatin-induced hearing loss in patients with HNSCC. Subjects with previously untreated HNSCC who are
scheduled for cisplatin-based chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and are not already taking a statin will be
randomized to receive either oral atorvastatin (40 mg) or placebo daily throughout CRT. Baseline audiometric
thresholds will be measured prior to onset of cisplatin therapy and again 3 months after completion of all cycles
of cisplatin. The primary outcome is the difference in incidence of a CTCAEv5.0 Grade 2 hearing loss following
cisplatin-based CRT comparing subjects taking atorvastatin vs. those taking a placebo. As a secondary
objective, we will assess for differences between atorvastatin and placebo groups in patient-reported outcomes
focusing on overall quality of life, hearing, balance, tinnitus, and peripheral neuropathy. As an exploratory
objective, we will estimate whether statins affect survival in patients with HNSCC. Subjects will be followed for
two years after CRT to estimate 2-year overall and disease-free survival."

Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth
face substantial health disparities compared to their cisgender and straight peers. They must also contend with
stereotypes, such as the model minority myth, contributing to misconceptions and inaccurate/insufficient
information to guide intervention strategies. AANHPI youth are not a monolith; yet, they are often aggregated in
studies, masking important health disparities across AANHPI subpopulations. Intersectionality is a critical
analysis framework describing complex ways that power and privilege are structured based on mutually
constitutive social positions and how processes that confer privilege and disadvantage impact people’s lives.
Exposure to overlapping concurrent forms of social oppression (e.g., homophobia and racism simultaneously)
may differentially affect treatment of AANHPI youth subgroups, yielding longer-term health concerns. AANHPI
youth facing multiple marginalization may experience challenges that affect healthy development, but also
unique strengths. AANHPI youth are a fast-growing, poorly understood population, especially AANHPI SGM
youth, and their risks and support needs are critical public health issues. This proposed developmental study
responds to NOT-HL-23-001 and is an ancillary study to a funded R01 (MD015722). We will use an
intersectional lens and a sequential explanatory design to answer questions specific to AANHPI SGM youth
(13-19 years old), which are beyond the scope of our existing study: 1) What are differences in bullying, risk
behaviors, mental health, and protective factors among AANHPI youth with different social positions (e.g.
AANHPI sexual and/or gender minority youth, various ethnic groups)? 2) How do differences in protective
factors and other characteristics explain variations in bullying, risk behaviors, and mental health among
AANHPI youth (and ethnic groups) with different social positions? and 3) What positive and negative
experiences are relevant to the overlapping, simultaneous production of inequalities by AANHPI ethnicity and
SGM identity? We will explore these new areas using two study aims: first, conduct intersectionality-informed,
harmonized and parallel quantitative analyses of three adolescent datasets to examine risk and protective
factors for AANHPI youth at intersecting social positions. We will use the California Healthy Kids Survey
(N~1,042,000), Minnesota Student Survey (N~122,000), and LGBTQ National Teen Survey (N~17,000).
Second, we will conduct interviews with 15 AANHPI SGM youth to gain rich insight into Aim 1 findings and 15
professionals who work with AANHPI SGM youth to understand training/resource needs and interpersonal and
community-specific assets. Findings will generate concrete recommendations to bolster care and service
systems for AANHPI SGM youth. This study, capitalizing on existing protocols, resources and mentorship of
our funded R01, is expected to provide preliminary data to develop and test training programs for educators,
health professionals and service providers in various settings to improve the wellbeing of AANHPI youth."

 Breast cancer frequently metastasizes to the axillary lymph nodes (ALN). The cancer spread from the
primary breast tumor can occur during the early stages, and ALN metastasis is usually the earliest detectable
cancer spread. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the standard approach for axillary staging in breast
cancer patients with no palpable axillary adenopathy or when ALN metastasis is not detected during the
presurgical diagnosis. Currently, SLN is identified by a peritumoral injection of a radioactive tracer, technetium
99mTc and/or blue dye, followed by a SLN biopsy for pathological examination. Although this peritumoral
injection method can identify the location of SLN, it does not intraoperatively distinguish between LN
metastases and healthy LN as it stains SLN regardless of the status of LN metastases. Thus, once SLN is
identified by 99mTc and/or blue dye, SLN is surgically removed regardless of cancer metastases status in SLN,
and sent for pathological assessment. The majority of patients with breast cancer (~70%) who undergo a SLN
biopsy are pathologically negative. Although the clinical benefits of a SLN biopsy have been observed, SLN
biopsies are often associated with postoperative complications such as lymphedema, seroma formation,
sensory nerve injury, and limitation in range of motion. Moreover, after a SLN biopsy, if pathological reports
show cancer negative in the SLN, then a complete ALN dissection can be avoided. When SLN is cancer
positive, patients need a second operation to complete the ALN dissection. This decision can be made during
the primary tumor resection or SLN biopsy if surgeons can detect LN involvement intraoperatively. Therefore,
a new intraoperative method for a clinically translated surgical visualization tool that can accurately detect LN
involvement is clinically needed to eliminate any delay in treatment and prevent unnecessary surgeries.
 To overcome previous and current challenges in identifying LN with cancer cells, our approach in this
application aims to intraoperatively distinguish LN with cancer cells from normal LN with a real-time
visualization tool. Our preliminary results with one breast cancer cell line showed that ICG-p28 preferentially
accumulated at the primary breast tumor and LN metastases, but not in healthy LN. Based on our preliminary
data, we hypothesize that our real-time imaging approach with ICG-p28 can intraoperatively/accurately
distinguish between LN metastases and healthy LN which will substantially improve the health of breast
cancer patients. We will test our hypothesis in mimicked intraoperative settings. Each aim/sub-aim will occur
in the collaborative and interdisciplinary environment to carry out our proposed research. Our unique imaging
approach can potentially provide a significant impact on SLN biopsy procedures. It will potentially provide
better treatments for breast cancer patients, which is a major milestone and relevant to the NIH focus area."
10825593,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Loneliness is highly prevalent among older adults and is associated with substantially increased risk for
dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recent evidence indicates that loneliness is associated with
accelerated rates of cognitive decline and neurobiological changes including accumulation of AD
neuropathology, neurodegeneration, and lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). However,
most prior studies have relied on cross-sectional designs or assessment of loneliness at a single timepoint, and
thus are not able to examine the temporal ordering or directionality of relationships. As a consequence, it remains
unclear whether loneliness is a risk factor for, or an indicator of, cognitive and neurobiological changes that are
associated with dementia. In the proposed project we will address this critical gap by: examining the longitudinal
bidirectional relationships between loneliness and cognitive function (Aim 1), and exploring neurobiological
mechanisms linking loneliness with dementia risk (Aim 2). To address these aims, we will leverage intensive
longitudinal data and biological samples from the established Einstein Aging Study (EAS), which includes a
diverse sample of older adults (aged ≥70 years) recruited via systematic probability sampling from the Bronx
County Registered Voter list. These participants have completed up to 4 annual assessment waves that include
a 16-day ecological momentary assessment (EMA) burst, collection of blood samples, and in-clinic assessment
for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Blood samples from each assessment have been analyzed for biomarkers
of AD neuropathology (amyloid-β, tau), neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]), and BDNF Val66Met
genetic polymorphism. The proposed project will add to this by analyzing BDNF levels in plasma from each
assessment wave. The outcomes of the project will be significant in informing whether loneliness is a sensitive
early indicator of cognitive dysfunction or a viable target for intervention to reduce risk for cognitive decline and
dementia. This will be the first study to examine the longitudinal relationships of loneliness and biomarkers of
AD, neurodegeneration, and BDNF in humans, to identify neurobiological mechanisms contributing to increased
cognitive decline and dementia risk of lonely individuals."

Emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern pose a
global challenge to the effectiveness of existing and future vaccines. This project will address questions
surrounding the immunological response to different sarbecovirus exposure patterns with implications for
vaccine development by conducting longitudinal repeated surveillance of unique human populations,
previously determined to be highly exposed to a diversity of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in
Myanmar. There is a timely opportunity to follow these communities, particularly immediately following
SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination to understand which previous sarbecovirus exposure patterns
expand the likelihood of development of pan-sarbecovirus neutralizing antibodies. We will evaluate the
impact of diverse patterns of natural and vaccination-based sarbecovirus exposure on development of pan-
sarbecovirus neutralizing antibodies by following three specific human cohorts: (1) elephant loggers
engaged in bushmeat hunting (including bats and pangolins) during the process of active deforestation of
Myanmar’s remaining teak forests, (2) bat guano harvesting communities surrounding HpaAn cave systems
in Kayin State and (3) a previously uninvestigated population engaged in religious activities within the Karst
cave systems in the Northern Dawna range. Waxing and waning of specific antibody responses will be
followed over time through use of pre-pandemic archived specimens from these populations and repeated
prospective sampling. We will utilize a novel Luminex bead-based multi-plex sarbecovirus assay, capable
of simultaneously detecting neutralizing antibodies against 21 different hACE2-binding sarbecoviruses.
Exposure patterns to specific sarbecoviruses will be identified and viral characteristics evaluated for their
contribution to the likelihood of developing pan-sarbecovirus antibody responses, including viral genetic and
functional phenotypic similarity and host plasticity (breadth of host species a virus is known to infect).
Patterns of prior natural sarbecovirus exposure coupled with natural SARS-COV-2 infection and / or
vaccination will then be evaluated for contributions to broadly reactive antibody responses. Data generated
through this project will inform on potential cross sarbecovirus clade vaccination strategies that could protect
against both known and future emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We will also conduct an in-depth
investigation of behavioral risk factors contributing to zoonotic sarbecovirus spillover that will aid in
mitigation strategies in this critically important ecological region for coronavirus emergence."

Excitatory synapses exhibit characteristic proteinaceous microcompartments at the membrane known as
the post-synaptic density (PSD). The PSD is richly organized into multi-protein complexes composed of
glutamate receptors, scaffolds, cytoskeleton, and signaling effectors. The dynamic reorganizations of the
higher-order architecture and composition of PSD signaling complexes underlies synaptic plasticity,
learning, and memory. Dissecting the interactions and allosteric communication mechanisms of the PSD
is a prerequisite for understanding the molecular underpinnings of synaptic plasticity. Synaptic signaling
complexes are large and highly dynamic, problematic targets for mainstay structural biology approaches.
The overarching goals of this project are to surmount the challenges of structural characterization of
PSD signaling complexes by applying a battery of protein footprinting, spectroscopies, chemical tools,
and proteomics approaches to probe protein structure in biologically relevant milieu. This project
focuses on the architecture, activation mechanisms, and scaffolding roles of SynGAP, an abundant PSD
GTPase-activating protein. SynGAP is critical to brain development, long-term potentiation, and spatial
learning. Importantly, SynGAP mutations in humans are associated with autism spectrum disorders,
schizophrenia, and intellectual disability. Despite its ubiquity and central signaling role, the architecture
and signaling mechanisms of SynGAP remain largely unknown. Defining the molecular mechanisms of
SynGAP signaling is critical for understanding the basis of brain disorders caused by SynGAP
dysfunction. Hybrid structural biology approaches will be integrated to build a structural model of the
multi-domain holoenzyme. These approaches are uniquely amenable to characterizing dynamic protein
interfaces and conformational changes in solution. Phosphorylation-induced conformational changes
will be defined to determine activation mechanisms. SynGAP apparently regulates opposing pathways
dictating synaptic strength via dual specificity toward both Ras and Rap. Specificity switching
mechanisms will be revealed by mapping structural determinants of Ras and Rap interactions. By
dissecting the structural basis for SynGAP function the proposed research will be a vital contribution to
the ongoing movement to characterize the molecular architecture of the PSD. Resolving SynGAP
signaling complex structure and mechanisms will clarify the basis of SynGAP-linked neuronal disorders
and spur the development of future therapeutics."
10802371,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Intestinal malrotation (IM) is a highly prevalent birth defect that can lead to life-threatening conditions
necessitating surgical intervention and long-term supplemental nutrition. Atrazine (ATR), a ubiquitous herbicide
that perturbs electron transport chain (ETC) reactions, was found to cause IM at high frequency. Preliminary
data show that ATR decreases mitochondrial respiration (i.e., oxidative phosphorylation; oxphos) and increases
glycolytic activity in the developing intestine. However, while early gut development can subsist on glycolysis
alone, later gut development requires oxphos; thus, ATR may block a critical metabolic switch from glycolysis to
mitochondrial respiration (oxphos) during intestine morphogenesis.
 During normal gut development, intestinal rotation occurs simultaneously with gut lengthening, and
shorter gut lengths are often associated with IM, suggesting that gut elongation mechanisms are integral to the
rotation process. Indeed, cellular analyses reveal that ATR perturbs crucial events required to drive intestinal
lengthening, including early mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions (MET) and, later, interkinetic nuclear migration
(IKNM) -- common morphogenetic processes recently found to be influenced by cellular metabolic states.
 Together, these data suggest that a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxphos drives proper
intestine rotation by regulating the timing and/or localization of MET and IKNM events during gut
elongation. This hypothesis will be tested using innovative metabolomics technologies to determine: 1) how
ATR affects the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular metabolism during intestine morphogenesis, and 2) how
dynamic cellular metabolic states affect the timing and localization of MET and IKNM within the developing
intestine. Successful completion of these aims will illuminate the poorly understood etiology of IM, and will have
implications for the role of metabolism-altering toxins, diseases, and/or pregnancy conditions in the development
of structural birth defects that depend on MET- and/or IKNM-mediated morphogenesis."
11123770,"Brain-immune crosstalk in myocardial infarction
Project Summary
Myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause of death worldwide and even survivors suffer from reduced
quality of life, increased hospitalization rates, high health care costs, and lower life expectancy. Decades of
research have improved primary prevention as well as interventional and drug therapies, but the clinical
problem for MI patients remains huge, particularly regarding aspects of post-MI healing. While some patients
develop a stable scar with adaptive remodeling of the surviving myocardium and a compensated cardiac
function for many years, other patients with comparable extent of initial damage rapidly develop ischemic heart
failure with extremely poor prognosis. Furthermore, an MI triggers a vicious inflammatory cycle of further
atherosclerosis acceleration, increasing the risk for subsequent ischemic events. Various studies have shown
that the immune system plays a critical role in these processes. An MI activates multiple sensory systems of
the brain, including pain, stress, and autonomic centers, as well as hypothalamic and brainstem sensors of
inflammation and hemodynamics. It was recently described that distinct brain regions control large scale
leukocyte shifts and functional alterations during episodes of acute stress (Poller et al., Nature 2022). How
different brain centers orchestrate the immune response to an MI and whether such neuro-immune axes can
be therapeutically harnessed to optimize post-MI inflammation and healing via targeted non-invasive brain
interventions is unknown. This project combines state-of-the-art tools of neuroscience, cardiology, and
immunology to comprehensively explore how an MI alters regional brain activity and how different brain
centers in turn shape the course of MI healing. Aim 1 combines interruption of different sensory input branches
with iDISCO cFos ClearMap histology, fiber photometry, and retrograde tracing to map MI-induced alterations
in neuronal circuit activity. Preliminary data show strongly altered neuronal firing after an MI. Aim 2 elucidates
the effects of MI-activated brain centers on the peripheral immune response after an MI. Preliminary data show
that ablation of stress centers in the brain increases post-MI leukocytosis in bone marrow and heart, whereas
chemogenetic stimulation of hypothalamic CRH neurons after an MI strongly reduces myocardial inflammation,
which is known to correlate with better functional outcomes. Aim 2 combines different MI models with an
established set of gain and loss-of-function interventions, including chemogenetics, optogenetics, viral tracing,
brain-region specific KO mice, and cell-type specific stress hormone receptor KO mice to investigate how
different brain regions contribute to post MI inflammation and healing. Finally, Aim 3 integrates gained insights
and focuses on blocking detrimental while enhancing beneficial aspects of neuro-immune signaling, e.g. by
dynamically manipulating CRH neuron activity during defined phases after an MI, to therapeutically tailor brain-
immune crosstalk toward better MI healing. Aim 3 will provide the scientific basis for translational approaches
such as transcranial magnetic stimulation of specific brain regions to improve MI patients’ outcomes."
10820428,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., accounting for about 132,000 deaths per
year. While targeted therapies of lung adenocarcinoma have improved overall survival, similar advances in lung
squamous carcinoma (LUSC) have been stagnant. Extensive molecular profiling through the Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) effort revealed that LUSC tumors are highly idiosyncratic and rarely driven by solitary actionable
pathways. Also, metastasis, rather than primary tumors, is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths.
However, the mechanistic underpinnings of how LUSC spreads are very poorly understood. In this proposal, we
will investigate the roles of a circle RNA (circRNA), CDR1as, on its regulation of LUSC metastasis. To investigate
the regulatory role of CDR1as on LUSC metastasis, we have recently developed sophisticated LUSC models
that metastasize to sites common to human disease. By integrating clinical LUSC TCGA data with our mouse
models, we have identified CDR1as as a key driver of LUSC metastasis. We have found that CDR1as plays a
key role in stabilizing the coding mRNA transcript for cerebellar degeneration-related protein 1 (CDR1). We found
that CDR1as and CDR1 are each necessary for LUSC metastasis, and CDR1 over-expression alone is sufficient
to promote LUSC metastasis. We found CDR1 interacts with several specific Golgi trafficking proteins, and CDR1
expression corresponds with poor LUSC survival and tightly couples with an epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) program. Additionally, we have found key structural elements of CDR1as that promote its RNA stability
and expression levels. Taken together, key questions arise, such as: 1) How does CDR1 trafficking in the Golgi
vesicles promote migration and metastasis? 2) Can oligo-mediated targeting of CDR1as block LUSC metastasis
and prolong survival? The objectives of this proposal are to define how CDR1 promotes LUSC metastasis
through Golgi trafficking. We will also determine the biologic and therapeutic implications of interrupting structural
elements of CDR1as."
10833161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Poly-(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors as a drug class are considered one of the great success
stories of Precision Medicine with Food and Drug Administration drug approvals accumulating for growing
proportions of patients with diverse cancer types. As well, preclinical studies are investigating their use in a
multitude of non-malignant diseases. These drugs inhibit multiple PARP enzymes at once, some of which are
critical enzymes for sensing and coordinating repair of several types of DNA damage. Further, these drugs trap
the PARP1 enzyme onto DNA, resulting in a DNA double strand break to resolve this lesion. Thus, by design,
these drugs increase DNA damage in cells, raising concern that they could be toxic to or even mutate normal
cells that rely on PARP enzymes for their functions. Thus, clinical trial and drug safety databases showing serious
bone marrow adverse effects, including severe, and sometimes irreversible lowering of the blood counts, and an
increased risk of deadly therapy-related bone marrow cancers suggest that hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells are uniquely susceptible to PARP inhibitor effects. However, mechanism and causation are not yet clear.
 The long-term goal is to understand normal bone marrow function and if patients with germline or
acquired mutations in their bone marrow cells are uniquely susceptible to the adverse effects of specific
exposures. The central hypothesis is that 1) PARP inhibitors, due to their ability to stall replication forks and
cause double strand DNA breaks, impair hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation, resulting in
decreased blood cell production from the most proliferative subsets more than others., and that 2) these PARP
inhibitor effects mobilize long-term stem cells to help meet blood production demands and at the same time
create a competitive environment in which stem cells with TP53 or other mutations are favored to outgrow wild-
type, but ultimately predisposing patients to bone marrow failure or leukemia. The rationale for this project is that
an ever-expanding group of patients are being treated with PARP inhibitors and many experience serious blood
and bone marrow toxicities, including development of therapy-related blood cancers, but the mechanism and
methods to prevent these serious toxicities are not known. Using mouse and human in vitro and in vivo models,
we will test these hypotheses with the following specific aims: 1) Determine how PARP inhibitors disrupt normal
hematopoiesis to cause cytopenias; and 2) Determine whether PARP inhibitors create a selective environment
and unmask fitness differences in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with varying genotypes or are able to
mutate these cells on their own.
 The research proposed in this application is innovative because it is the first study to determine how
inhibiting multiple PARP enzymes simultaneously impacts normal hematopoiesis on a mechanistic level. This
proposal is significant because it will allow identification of prevention strategies for safe PARP inhibitor use and
of new drug targets for improving hematopoiesis via PARP enzyme manipulations."

The major goal of this grant application is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which age-related
elevation of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) in dermal fibroblasts creates a microenvironment that promotes
the aging process and age-related skin pathologies, including cancer.
Aging affects all individuals and is the single greatest risk factor for most common diseases, including cancer.
The characteristic features of aged human skin include dermal thinning, wrinkles, sagging and loss of elasticity,
resulting from disruption and degradation of collagen, the major structural protein in skin. Deterioration of
dermal collagen ﬁbrils is also directly connected to age‐related skin morbidities, such as tearing, bruising, poor
wound healing, and critically contributes to weakened immunity, and cancer. We found that matrix
metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), which initiates cleavage of collagen fibrils, is significantly increased in aged
human skin dermal fibroblasts. This increase is associated with fragmentation and disorganization of collagen
fibrils and creates age-related aberrant extracellular matrix (ECM) microenvironment in the dermis (dermal
aging).
Based on above human skin in vivo data, we have recently generated a mouse model of skin dermal aging by
fibroblast-specific expression of human MMP1, the source of the elevated MMP-1 in aged human skin, driven
by a stromal cell-specific pdgfra-Cre transgene (pdgfra-Cre;MMP1). pdgfra-Cre;MMP1 mice exhibit
significantly accelerated dermal aging, which closely mimics those observed in aged human skin. Importantly,
pdgfra-Cre;MMP1 mice have substantially increased susceptibility to skin cancer/papilloma development,
suggesting dermal aging microenvironment promotes age-related keratinocyte skin cancer.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that age-related elevation of MMP1 in dermal fibroblasts leads to
progressive alterations of the dermal ECM, which creates a microenvironment that promotes the dermal aging
process and age-related skin pathologies, including cancer. This data-driven hypothesis is based on a novel
concept that skin dermal aging is governed by the adaptation of fibroblasts to the surrounding extracellular
matrix (ECM) microenvironment (outside-in adaptation), rather than cell‐autonomous factors. We propose
following Specific Aims to test above hypothesis. Aim 1: Determine the Molecular Signatures/Pathways
During Dermal Aging Process. Aim 2: Investigate Mechanisms by which Dermal Aging is Driven by Fibroblast
Adaptation to the Surrounding ECM Microenvironment in a Non-Cell-Intrinsic Manner. Aim 3: Define the
Impact of Ageing of the Dermal Microenvironment on Keratinocyte Cancer Initiation. This proposal is
innovative and may have profound impact on the field of aging and age-related diseases by identifying age-
related ECM microenvironment as a key target for therapeutic intervention."

Arterial stiffness is a hallmark of vascular aging and is related to increased cardiovascular disease events and
vascular dementias. Inflammatory damage and extracellular matrix remodeling have been proposed as the major
pathological causes of vascular injury and arterial stiffness. However, the molecular mechanisms that initiate
and propagate aging-related pathological changes in large blood vessels remain unclear. Here, we propose to
study the role of neutrophil elastase (NE), a neutrophil-specific protease, in initiating vascular leakage,
inflammation and fibrosis in aged mice both with and without obesity. Neutrophils are the most abundant
leukocytes, have a short lifespan, and play a critical role in initiating tissue damage and inflammation. Our data
demonstrated (1) that pulse wave velocity (PWV), the primary parameter of arterial stiffness, was decreased in
NE knockout (NEKO) mice compared to their wild-type littermates, and (2) that NEKO mice were resistant to
aging-related inflammation, fibrosis and calcification in the aorta. We also observed that NE has potent effects
on increasing vascular endothelial permeability and enhancing aortic smooth muscle cell fibrogenic and
osteogenic phenotypic switch. Further, NE regulates neutrophil proinflammatory phenotype by degrading
longevity regulator Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1). Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that pro-inflammatory
neutrophils interact with blood vessels, causing vascular damage and remodeling through the release of NE.
The latter contributes to the increased vascular permeability, fibrotic remodeling and calcification in the blood
vessels. Thus, inhibiting NE may lead to protective effects on aging-related vascular damage, fibrotic remodeling,
calcification, and subsequent arterial stiffness. The objective of this RO1 proposal is to explore how neutrophils
and NE regulate inflammatory remodeling in the arterial wall during the aging process with or without feeding of
an obesogenic diet. We will explore whether NE contributes to vascular aging by activating protease-activated
receptor 2 (PAR2) and epithelium sodium channel (ENaC) signaling pathways in vascular endothelial cells and
vascular smooth muscle cells with both in vitro and in vivo studies. Also, we will examine the role of the NE–Sirt1
signaling pathway in the regulation of neutrophil phenotype and aging-related vascular injury and remodeling in
mice. Finally, we will evaluate potential therapeutic effects of a selective NE inhibitor on aging-related arterial
stiffness in mice. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel therapeutic strategy for vascular aging
and related diseases."
10865141,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Perinatal stroke can result in motor impairments, and is one of the major causes of cerebral palsy (CP)
diagnosis later in childhood. Because of the rapid development and heightened neuroplasticity in the first years
of life, intervention provided earlier rather than later is thought to offer the best chance of recovery following
perinatal stroke. However, the evidence for early interventions is lacking, mainly due to the paucity of data
regarding brain organization, connectivity and resulting motor development after perinatal stroke in humans.
Therefore, in this proposed study, our objective is to perform a multimodal, non-invasive assessment of infant
brain and behavioral development over the first two years of life to identify possible bioindicators of recovery
and repair which may be targeted by future interventions. Our study design incorporates longitudinal
assessment over the first two years of life after perinatal stroke of brain excitability and organization using non-
invasive brain stimulation, in addition to neuroimaging and age-appropriate behavioral assessments. We will
recruit 50 infants with perinatal stroke from local and regional neonatal intensive care units for assessment at 4
time points up to 24 months of age. Measures of brain excitability and connectivity will be correlated with motor
development and possible CP diagnosis to study the trajectory and patterns of recovery over time. If the child
has been diagnosed with CP, a trained investigator will also assign a Gross Motor Functional Classification
Scale level and a mini-Manual Ability Classification Scale level to predict motor function and plan for care.
Ultimately, identifying structure/function relationships discovered in this study will allow development of tailored
early interventions, based on individual patterns of brain development, designed to improve life-long motor
function in infants with CP due to perinatal stroke, as well as development of early interventions for other
related neurologic diagnoses."

than 10M Americans resulting in more than 150,000 limb amputations each year in the U.S. In addition, more
than 300,000 patients have coronary artery bypass grafting (surgical revascularization). Current medical
therapies for vascular disease include limb amputation and vascular bypass grafting--these therapeutic
interventions have significant limitations. These diseases are chronic, debilitating, lethal and they warrant new
and novel therapies. Previous studies have demonstrated the essential role for pioneer factors that modulate
chromatin accessibility and thereby impact the binding of early transcriptional regulators for lineage
specification. We have recently demonstrated that ETV2 is an essential pioneer factor for endothelial, vascular
and blood lineages. We have used global and conditional gene disruption strategies, fate-mapping, gene
editing, single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq assays to provide supportive data for this application. In
addition, we defined an important ETV2-miR130a-PDGFRa cascade that governs endothelial development.
Furthermore, our recent publications and our preliminary data support the overall hypothesis that
ETV2 is a pioneer factor that regulates the specification of the endothelial lineage. In these proposed
studies, we will use a number of unique genetic models that we have engineered and we take an innovative
strategy to define the mechanisms whereby ETV2 functions as a pioneer factor to regulate cardiovascular
regeneration. To examine our hypotheses, we will address the following specific aims: Specific Aim #1:
Specific Aim #1: To further define the mechanisms whereby ETV2 functions as a pioneer factor during
embryogenesis and reprogramming to the endothelial lineage; Specific Aim #2: To define the role of
chromatin modifying factors and ETV2 during embryogenesis and reprogramming to the endothelial
lineage and Specific Aim #3: To examine the factors that promote ETV2 mediated reprogramming of
the endothelial lineage in vitro and in vivo. These aims will utilize our recently engineered genetic mouse
models, ATAC-seq, MNase-seq, ChIP-seq, inducible mouse model, cardiac injury model in the adult mouse,
novel and bioinformatics algorithms to comprehensively define the mechanisms whereby ETV2 functions as a
pioneer factor and will serve as prelude for therapeutic initiatives to engineer and promote regeneration of the
cardiovascular lineages. Given the tremendous morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular disease in our

in 1976, remains a vibrant program for developing scientific leaders in hematology and transfusion medicine.
Historically, our program has been particularly effective in recruiting MD researchers to pursue disease-based
research, with a record of retaining ~70% of our trainees in research-related careers. Our program’s success, in
large part, is due to careful selection of trainees, rigorous scientific training, strong mentoring and a training
environment replete with physical and intellectual resources. In this competing renewal, we request continued
support for a two-year training program for post-doctoral fellows (MD, MD-PhD and PhDs) and two new short-
term training positions for medical students to pursue hematology and transfusion research. Trainees for this
program are accepted on the basis of research proposals focused on one of four fields of study, including
Transfusion Medicine and Hemoglobinopathies (Track I); Hemostasis & Thrombosis (Track II), Hematopoiesis
& Cellular Therapy (Track III), and Molecular Biology, Signaling & Genetics (Track IV). Upon program entry,
post-doctoral trainees pursue a research-intensive program in basic/translational or clinical investigation
supplemented by educational and training program activities. Educational activities for postdoctoral trainees will
include required coursework in statistics as related to their clinical or basic research interests, attendance at
research conferences relevant to their training tracks and enrolling in graduate level courses to consolidate their
scientific knowledge. Additional program activities are designed to bolster career development of individual
postdoctoral trainees through “T32 Strategy” seminars covering a range of topics from tailored Individual
Development Plans, effective mentoring practices and discussion of various career pathways given by T32
alumni in basic, clinical or industry research careers. Monthly research in progress meetings are designed to
provide peer to peer interactions, group mentoring from Scholarship Oversight Committees and scientific
feedback from Executive Committee members. Program oversight is provided by an Executive Committee that
meets on a monthly basis and an External Advisory Board that will meet annually with program administration
and trainees. To expand the hematology pipeline and introduce hematology research to students while early in
medical training, we are requesting two short-term training slots for medical students. Medical students will
participate in an 8-12-week immersive research experience in the labs of experienced mentors and have an
opportunity to attend a national hematology meeting. For all trainees, the program continues to place emphasis

Genetic variances, environmental stress factors and aging can initiate pathological conditions in lens cells

nuclear cataracts are impacted by a functional loss of connexin 46 (Cx46) with genetic variances including
CP49 and periaxin (Prx) occurred between mouse strains C57BL/6J (B6) and 129 Svjae (129). This research

10851748,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recently, we discovered that a small molecule inhibitor of acetyl CoA synthetase (ACS), AR-12, has broad
spectrum fungicidal activity in vitro and promising activity in vivo. Consistent with this broad spectrum of activity,
genetic studies indicate that ACS is essential for viability in multiple fungi (C. albicans, Fusarium, S. cerevisiae).
In contrast, ACS is not essential in mammals. This is likely because, in mammals and plants, the vast majority
of acetyl CoA is derived from ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) and not ACS. The most important exception to this rule is
the cancer cell where ACS is the predominant source of acetyl CoA. Consequently, ACS has emerged as an
anti-cancer target. Although the development of AR-12 stalled, we propose that its target, ACS, remains worthy
of further exploration as the basis for a new class of antifungal drugs.To identify novel inhibitors of fungal ACSs,
we have developed a multi-disciplinary approach based on: 1) two complementary small molecule screening
strategies; 2) the structural characterization ACS-inhibitor complexes from multiple pathogenic fungi: 3) whole
cell assays of ACS function and inhibition, and 4) medicinal chemistry strategies that have already yielded
micromolar inhibitors of ACS. An STD-NMR screen with C. neoformans Acs1 and identified 492 ACS interacting
molecular fragments, of which the vast majority also interacted with multiple fungal ACS enzymes. In Aim 1, we
will further characterize these hits. As a parallel strategy, we adapted our ACS activity assay for high throughput
screening (HTS) with the goal of directly identifying small molecule ACS inhibitors. Our chemistry plan (Aim 2)
is guided, in part, by the hypothesis that molecules mimicking the acetyl adenosine-monophosphate ester
(AcAMP) intermediate are likely to be effective inhibitors. In Aim 2A, we will characterize the acetyl-PO3 binding
pocket by a structure-activity study of AcAMP mimics derived from molecules already crystallized in the active
site of fungal ACSs. Biochemically stable, potent acetyl-PO3 isosteres emerging from this analysis will then be
linked with putative ATP/AMP-binding pocket-targeted fragments to assemble candidate non-nucleoside, bi-
substrate ACS inhibitors. To complement this hypothesis-based strategy, candidate inhibitors will also be
assembled from other strongly interacting fragments and we will optimize inhibitors directly identified in the ACS
activity-based HTS screen (Aims 2B&C). New molecules will be evaluated (Aim 3) with a testing funnel that
includes biochemical characterization of ACS inhibition, antifungal activity against a range of pathogenic fungi,
whole cell assays of on-target activity against ACS, and initial in vitro toxicity/ADME characterization. Our goal
is to identify a lead ACS inhibitor scaffold along with a back-up series for further pre-clinical development as
broad-spectrum antifungal drug candidates."
10884407,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Goal: This proposal provides a structured research training program under the guidance of mentors and advisors
in related fields to promote Dr. Levine’s development into an independent clinician-scientist. Her long-term goal
is leading a multidisciplinary research teams to develop patient-centered treatment pathways and interventions
that improve outcomes and mitigate disparities in eosinophilic mucin chronic rhinosinusitis.
Research: Chronic rhinosinusitis is a debilitating disease of the paranasal sinuses that affects up to 16% of the
United States (US) population, causing intractable congestion, smell loss, and persistent headaches that can
lead to permeant and life-threatening morbidities. Research in diverse populations demonstrates that Hispanic
and Black patients are more likely to have severe chronic rhinosinusitis disease subtypes such as eosinophilic
mucin chronic rhinosinusitis (EMRS), a subtype common in the southern US. Hispanic and Black EMRS patients
present with more advanced disease, have worse post-treatment outcomes, and have high rates of morbidity
including facial bone deformities and vision changes. The etiology behind the disparities in EMRS presentation
and outcomes are unknown. Fundamental questions about how to reduce disease burden cannot be answered
until we understand the factors that influence EMRS treatment outcomes. The goal of this proposal is generating
evidence to predict EMRS treatment outcomes and reduce health disparities. We will employ a prospective
longitudinal cohort study and use semi-structured interviews of patients and providers to identify important EMRS
treatment outcome determining factors. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that EMRS disparities result
from the interplay of individual- and community-level health determinants and environmental exposures that have
quantifiable impacts on EMRS clinical and biological outcome measures. To test this, we will: 1) develop a
computation model integrating multi-level factors to predict EMRS post-surgical outcomes; 2) determine best-
practices to facilitate efficient and effective clinician-patient communication and EMRS care; 3) develop a pilot
intervention to reduce delays in care. We will engage stakeholders in pilot intervention development and
feedback. The proposed research aligns with the NIMHD mission to develop new research methods to improve
minority health and reduce health disparities. The research results will help inform clinical practice and treatment
recommendations to improve the quality of EMRS care and reduce disparities.
Training: To accomplish these aims Dr. Levine will receive mentorship, focused didactics, one-on-one tutorials,
and hands-on training in team science and mixed methods research, incorporating important aspects of
computational modeling and qualitative research. She will establish a robust rhinology research network to
facilitate a pathway to independence. A NIMHD K23 award will provide Dr. Levine with the protected time and
essential training to achieve her career goals of improving outcomes and reducing disparities for EMRS patients."
10841419,"PROJECT 3: PROJECT SUMMARY
In work on hearing loss, variability in outcomes is a persistent puzzle. Listeners with comparable hearing do
not always perform similarly in noise or the real world. Project 3 proposes this derives from two linked issues.
First, clinical tests focus on accuracy. But accuracy is not sufficient. To cope with real-world demands, speech
perception must be efficient and flexible. Second, not all variation is due to the auditory periphery. Cognitive
ability, which declines with age, could exacerbate the effects of hearing loss. However, research has largely
focused on general cognitive skills like working memory. Mechanisms specific to language have not received
much attention. Project 3 links these issues, testing the hypothesis that the cognitive mechanisms of language
processing are how listeners achieve efficiency and flexibility. We address this in word recognition, a hub in the
language system linking sound and meaning. Cognitive models suggest listeners match the speech signal to
thousands of candidates in the lexicon via a competition process, and that variation in efficiency and flexibility
are emergent from this competition. This is tested with eye-movements techniques that yield a temporally rich
picture of the dynamics of competition. Prior work suggests two profiles of competition for CI users. Successful
CI users show a small delay and keep competitors available to facilitate revisions after a mistake. In contrast,
listeners who struggle wait to access candidates until most of the word is heard and show reduced competition.
Project 3 asks if these dimensions of efficiency are uniquely important for outcomes over and above the
auditory periphery. Data from the last funding cycle support this idea, linking efficiency to aging, listening effort,
the listening environment, and cortical structure. Project 3 builds on this with four aims. Aim 1 conducts a large
multi-modal cross-sectional study of experienced CI users and a longitudinal study of new recipients. These
studies ask what factors drive differences in efficiency, both in the moment and during adaptation to the CI.
They investigate the role of real-world practice (using ecological momentary assessment, social network
analysis and device logs), language skills (using neuropsychological tests and a new reading/eye-movement
task), cortical integrity (using pre-implantation MRI), and listening effort (using pupillometry). They also ask
whether differences in efficiency predict differences in outcomes including the ability to keep up with fast
speech. Aim 2 asks how the dimensions of efficiency adapt to challenging listening, using a novel experimental
paradigm in which sentence contexts create expectations for either noise or rapid speech. Aim 3 asks whether
efficiency is related to the way CI users combine information across ears. It uses a dichotic listening paradigm
to ascertain whether information is combined into a composite object prior to speech recognition or integrated
later. This measure is related to auditory encoding in each ear, and to eye-tracking measure of efficiency.
Together, this work will reveal a new standard for assessment outcomes (efficiency), and other modifiable
factors (real-world practice, tuning to support binaural integration) to enhance outcomes."
10841420,"ABSTRACT – HUMAN ECOLOGY – PROJECT 4
Cochlear implants (CIs) improve speech recognition for adults with moderate to severe hearing loss; however,
many CI users report significant struggles in their natural listening environments. This is understandable as
speech recognition in complex daily environments are likely to be affected by challenges that are not present in
the sound booth (e.g., high reverberation and accented speech). Indeed, many listeners with CIs report that
difficulty in real-world listening leads to fatigue, stress, and social isolation. CI clinical care has traditionally
focused measures of speech recognition assessed in clinic with the assumption that broader outcomes like
quality of life (QoL) will directly follow. The past literature has shown that lab/clinical measures of speech
recognition are only modestly correlated with QoL, suggesting that the factors that impact speech recognition
in the lab are likely to differ from those that affect speech perception and QoL in CI users’ everyday lives. The
primary goals of the proposed project are to identify challenging listening situations that CI users encounter in
daily life and to examine factors that predict real-world speech perception and QoL over and above what is
measured in the clinic. The study focuses on the role that CI users’ auditory environments, higher order
cognitive skills, and social networks play in real-world listening success and QoL.
The project includes cross-sectional and longitudinal components that combine Ecological Momentary
Assessments (EMA) of real world listening, neuropsychological measures across cognitive domains, and
analysis of individuals’ social networks. Aim 1 will describe the complexity and challenges of auditory
environments encountered in daily life for CI users using objective data collected using ear-level microphones
and self-reports via EMA. We will identify differences in the auditory environment across individuals of varying
age, geographic location, occupational status, and race, and explore the impact of differences in hearing (e.g.,
pre- vs. post-implantation) on the environments one engages in. Aim 2 will identify factors that predict success
with speech perception in the real world (assessed using EMA). This includes data about the auditory
environment collected from Aim 1, and a neuropsychological battery spanning multiple higher-order cognitive
domains. We propose that the auditory environment and cognitive function will explain unique variance in real-
world speech perception, after controlling for the effect of peripheral auditory function and speech perception
measured in the lab. Aim 3 will determine the factors that drive good QoL after implantation. We propose that
speech perception in the real world, higher order cognitive skills, and social network characteristics (e.g., social
support and social integration) will play a more important role in driving QoL than speech perception measured
in the lab."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and
affects 18+ million adults nationally. However, 80% of ASCVD deaths may be prevented with prompt intervention
following early screening for ASCVD risk – a powerful rationale for the unmet need of accurate subclinical
ASCVD diagnoses. Thus, in this study we assess whether a deep learning (DL)-based analysis of pre-existing
abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans paired with electronic medical records (EMR) improves prediction
of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in a large multi-site primary prevention population. We
will conduct this study in a large, diverse, real-world population with an external validation to ascertain whether
we can improve upon the clinically-utilized pooled cohort equations (PCE) that have numerous shortcomings.
20+ million abdominal CT scans performed annually in the US. While these scans answer specific clinical
questions, quantitative information related to tissue phenotypes associated with cardiometabolic risk is simply
not evaluated. DL algorithms can be used to quantify body composition metrics for adipose tissue, muscle, bone,
liver, and vascular calcifications, which can all be used to improve upon the PCE for determining cardiovascular
events. In aim 1 of our proposal, we will build automated segmentation algorithms with a built-in quality control
mechanism to extract these body composition metrics in 125,000+ diverse subjects to ascertain population-level
normative values of tissue size and radiodensity. In aim 2, we will augment the PCE covariates with these body
composition values and additional EMR features for predicting ASCVD risk with advanced DL models. Moreover,
we will devise new algorithmic approaches for improving health equity by ensuring similar model performance
across patient sub-groups of PCE eligibility, race/ethnicity, insurance type, and CT scanner make/model. In aim
3, we will build a new ASCVD risk estimator that directly uses 3D imaging data. We will augment this end-to-end
prediction approach by integrating multi-modal models that leverage both imaging data and EMR data. Realizing
the need for improved explainability of DL solutions, we will build digital twins of each subject to describe why
model predictions are being made and what changes a patient could make to lower ASCVD risk.
We will train all models on data from Stanford (25k patients), test on data from Stanford (8k patients), and
externally validate the models on data from three Mayo Clinic sites (20k+ patients) to assess the generalizability
of our tools. We have assembled an inter-disciplinary MPI team of DL experts, cardiologists, and abdominal
radiologists to build such ASCVD risk models. We develop innovative tools to improve accuracy, generalizability,
bias, and explainability of DL-based ASCVD risk models. Our long-term goal is to enable early detection of silent
atherosclerosis and trigger interventions that may ultimately prevent over 800,000 death, myocardial infarction,
and stroke events in diverse Americans annually."
10835033,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Valid biomarkers of dietary fruit & vegetable intake can improve our understanding of the linkages between
infants’ and toddlers’ dietary intakes and health outcomes. Eating a variety of fruits & vegetables provides
energy, vitamins, minerals, and non-nutrient bioactives, and is associated with health benefits across the
lifespan. Introducing fruits & vegetables in infancy and toddlerhood supports their nutritional requirements and
lays the foundation for a long-term healthy dietary pattern. However, it is challenging for researchers and
organizations to easily and accurately monitor the fruit & vegetable intake of young children. A new application
of reflection spectroscopy may offer a non-invasive means by which infant and toddler carotenoid and fruit &
vegetable intake can be easily monitored. The technology measures the amount of carotenoids in the skin.
Carotenoids are fat-soluble pigments found in red, orange, yellow, and dark-green fruits & vegetables. Some
carotenoids convey pro-vitamin A activity, and are associated with visual and cognitive function and reduced
risks of adverse cardiovascular outcomes and some cancers. However, whether skin carotenoid measurement
is as reliable as the currently gold-standard measure of population fruit & vegetable intake, plasma carotenoid
concentrations, must be determined. Further, whether carotenoid intake in young children is associated with
visual function, a key bioactivity hypothesized for this population, is unknown. The purpose of this project is to
evaluate the validity of skin carotenoid measurement for estimation of infant and toddler fruit & vegetable and
carotenoid intake. Infants and toddlers will be longitudinally observed across solid food introduction and the
agreement between skin carotenoid measures with plasma carotenoids and reported carotenoid and fruit &
vegetable intake will be assessed. In a second study, the association between skin carotenoid measurement
with toddlers’ carotenoid concentrations, plasma carotenoids, and reported fruit & vegetable and carotenoid
intake will be observed at baseline, and then toddlers will be randomized to consume a controlled dietary
carotenoid intervention for 4 weeks to define the sensitivity of skin carotenoid measurement to detect changes
in dietary carotenoid intake. In a third study, we will define the associations of carotenoid intake with visual
function in toddlers and infants. This project will both define whether reflection spectroscopy is a valid measure
of infant and toddler fruit & vegetable intake and carotenoid intake, and will yield fundamental knowledge of the
determinants of and biological correlates of infant and toddler dietary carotenoid exposure."
10778606,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a frequent and life-threatening complication that significantly limits the
successful outcome of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell or bone marrow transplantation (referred to hereafter
at BMT). We have recently developed long-desired preclinical (murine) models of CMV reactivation after BMT
and show for the first time, that humoral immunity is critical to prevent viral recrudescence. We now demonstrate
that either the transfer of immune T cells or strain-specific sera (containing IgG antibody) prevents viral
reactivation, viremia, end-organ viral replication and CMV disease during graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We
plan to utilize our unique, but well-established preclinical models to define the impact of protective antibody on
the temporal and spatial characteristics of CMV reactivation, dissemination and antigen presentation.
Subsequently we will define the interplay of T cell and humoral responses that are required for the durable control
of CMV reactivation after BMT. Finally, we will develop clinically tractable pathways to enhance CMV immunity
whilst preventing GVHD and associated inflammation, targeting IL-6 inhibition. Our proposed studies will provide
critical insights into the immune requirements for effective and long-term control of CMV in recipients with GVHD
and/or clinically relevant immune suppression and inflammation that will allow us to optimize CMV immunity in
clinical BMT to improve patient outcomes."
10794392,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The heart of this proposal is to overturn the existing one-gene-at-a-time paradigm for studying human
genes in organismal model studies, and to push the envelope for studying genetic interactions in vivo.
We have developed a technology to study gene interactions in mouse models using a high-throughput
CRISPR technology suitable for interrogating specific genes implicated in a given pathway or disease.
An in vivo high-throughput targeted multi-mutation approach has never been accomplished in any
organismal model and this will revolutionize the study of complex gene interaction in physiologically
relevant organismal model systems. Our preliminary data have addressed the major feasibility gaps but
we need to further develop the platform and apply rigor/reproducibility.
Multimer technology will help bridge the gap between the enormous volumes of data generated by
genome sequencing studies and the ability to use these data for the understanding of biology and
disease. Our end goal is to benchmark the proposed technology, illustrating its application in a use-case
setting—targeting a set of CD antigens with orthogonal gene activation and gene editing CRISPR
machinery to reveal underlying genetic interactions and pathway directionality. Our general strategy is to
take advantage of novel tools and methodologies that we have developed during the past two years–
using innovative high throughput CRISPR screening methods. Our end goal is to develop a modular
toolset that advances functional genomics approaches. All this will be done in vivo in an animal model.
Our goal is to pilot an orthogonal Multimer platform to investigate up to 900 combinations of
perturbations in vivo in a single animal. We will benchmark our technology using CD antigens as
reporter genes that are easy to quantitate using commercially available monoclonal antibodies.
Targeted edits and transcript abundance will be analyzed by flow cytometry and via single-cell
sequencing on subpopulations of B and T cells.
The future for bioinformatically dissecting mechanisms of complex diseases is promising but
challenging. Multiple large-scale reference data sets of human sequences are rapidly becoming
available and are expected to increase over the coming decades. Millions of human genome
sequencing data sets will constitute an incredible resource for interpretation of DNA mutations.
Unfortunately, there are no feasible approaches for interrogating the thousands of combinations of
genes in animal models. This proposal aims to further a new technology that would advance complex
genetics problems relevant to organismal biology and human disease and will showcase promising new
technologies for studying genetic interaction in vivo."

The long-term goal of this project is to identify the genetic circuitry regulating tooth formation and replacement.
As 30 percent of people worldwide over the age of 65 have no natural teeth, understanding how teeth
regenerate is a major goal in biology. Furthermore, teeth, like most organs, form through repeated reciprocal
signaling between epithelia and mesenchyme. Thus, understanding the genetic basis of tooth formation and
replacement is important both for understanding organogenesis in general, as well as for understanding how
teeth can be regenerated in vitro and ultimately in vivo. Teeth are homologous to other vertebrate skin
appendages including mammalian hair, and shared genes regulate both tooth and hair formation. Although
genetic studies in humans, mice and other vertebrates have identified signaling pathways involved in tooth
formation, less is known about how genes regulate tooth replacement. In contrast, how genes regulate
mammalian hair regeneration is much more understood. One parsimonious hypothesis is that teeth and hair
regenerate using similar genetic circuits. Fish retain the ancestral jawed vertebrate condition of constant tooth
replacement throughout adult life. Fish also fertilize their offspring externally in large numbers, providing
powerful systems for developmental biology and genetic analyses. Threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus
aculeatus) offer a new and powerful system to learn the genetic basis of tooth formation and replacement.
Relative to low-toothed marine ancestors, derived freshwater populations evolve major heritable increases in
tooth number and tooth replacement rates. The different forms can be crossed in the lab, enabling detailed and
unbiased forward genetic analyses to map factors controlling the changes in tooth number. Genetic and
genomic experiments have mapped one genomic region controlling tooth number to a cis-regulatory intronic
tooth enhancer of the Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6 (Bmp6) gene in one high-toothed population. Relative to
the marine enhancer, the freshwater enhancer displays expanded tooth epithelial expression, and reduced
tooth mesenchymal expression, suggesting these spatial shifts in enhancer activity underlie evolved increases
in tooth number. Furthermore, in mice, BMP signaling negatively regulates hair regeneration, and in fish BMP
signaling negatively regulates tooth replacement. Together these data support the hypothesis of shared
genetic circuitry regulating tooth and hair regeneration. To test this hypothesis, three specific aims are
proposed. First, transgenic and genome editing experiments will determine which mutations in the freshwater
Bmp6 enhancer affect expression differences and tooth number. Second, genome editing experiments will
determine Wnt ligand function during tooth formation and replacement. Third, vital dye pulse-chase
experiments will test whether tooth replacement is coordinated within a tooth field. Together these aims will
reveal fundamental knowledge of the developmental genetic circuitry regulating tooth formation and
replacement, and provide further tests of the hypothesis that teeth regenerate similar to mammalian hair."
10841643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This proposal addresses a significant public health question: Does diabetes, the
3rd leading cause of death in the United States (US), impact suitability of donor corneal
tissue for transplantation? This question takes on increasing urgency as recent eye bank
data suggests donors with diabetes now comprise about 30-35% of the cornea donor
pool, a 50-72% increase in just over a decade. The impact of diabetes on keratoplasty
outcomes remains unknown, with conflicting evidence from secondary or retrospective
analyses of multiple clinical studies. Previous large clinical studies did not show a
diabetic donor effect on penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and Descemet membrane
endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) graft success, yet our recent Cornea Preservation Time
Study (CPTS) found the diabetic donor adversely affected graft outcomes following
Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). Although current
standard of care is to use diabetic donor corneas for all types of keratoplasties, some
eye banks and surgeons are increasingly avoiding them for DMEK. As both the diabetic
donor population and DMEK demand increases, a definitive superiority study evaluating
effect of donor diabetes status on graft outcomes will allay and/or define these concerns.
The Diabetes Endothelial Keratoplasty Study (DEKS) will address these important
questions through a prospective masked clinical trial enrolling 1420 participant-eyes at
30 clinical sites and 15 eye banks across the US. The DEKS will determine if the 3-year
graft success rate following DMEK performed with corneas from donors without diabetes
is superior to the graft success rate with corneas from donors with diabetes. It will also
determine if the 3-year central endothelial cell loss (ECL) after DMEK with corneas from
donors without diabetes is less than the central ECL when corneas from donors with
diabetes are used. Lastly, the DEKS will explore the relationship of donor diabetes
severity, as measured by eye bank-determined diabetes risk categorization scores, post-
mortem HbA1c, and skin advanced glycation endproducts and oxidation markers, with
DMEK graft outcomes 3 years postoperatively in corneas from diabetic donors. The
DEKS could have a major impact on the targeted use of corneas from an increasing
number of donors with diabetes with a range of disease severity in a donor pool that
must continue to expand to meet the clinical demands of an aging population and DMEK
growth."
10917086,"Background: Frailty is a syndrome of reduced physiologic reserve associated with higher postoperative
mortality and adverse outcomes. Our preliminary work shows that institution-wide frailty screening and
introducing a “pre-surgical pause” reduces 6-month mortality by threefold. However, a knowledge gap exists in
the nature of the intervention and which stakeholders should be involved in the “pre-surgical pause”.
Multidisciplinary care models for complex patients are highly effective in oncology, wound care and primary
care. We propose a new intervention i.e. PAtient-centered mUltidiSciplinary care for vEterans undergoing
surgery (PAUSE), where experts from diverse fields will contribute to surgical decision-making and
optimization of outcomes for high-risk Veterans.
Impact: Aging Veterans are a fast-growing population with significant need for high-quality surgical care. This
study will build a structured multidisciplinary workflow to improve clinical and quality outcomes and provide
high-value care per VA priorities for frail and high-risk Veterans that aligns with their goals and expectations.
Innovation: This is the first study in the VA to implement a multidisciplinary care model for surgical care. The
intervention employs an innovative hybrid 1 clinical effectiveness-implementation design to evaluate novel
Veteran-centric outcomes of 30- and 180-day mortality, non-home discharge, rehospitalizations and home-
time. A detailed formative evaluation (FE) will evaluate provider and system factors that impact uptake of the
PAUSE intervention. Further, the study has support from three national operational partners: National Surgery
Office (NSO), Office of Geriatrics and Extended Care, and Palliative Care and Hospice Program.
Specific Aims: Our goals for this project are three-fold: (1) to test the effectiveness of the PAUSE trial
intervention vs usual care in improving 30- and 180-day mortality, non-home discharge, rehospitalizations and
home-time for patients undergoing surgical evaluation; (2) to test moderators of the PAUSE intervention
effectiveness (treatment effect heterogeneity), especially specialty, frailty severity and risk status; and (3) to
use a mixed-method formative evaluation to understand the factors that influence fidelity, adaptation, and
implementation of the PAUSE intervention. We hypothesize that the PAUSE intervention will lead to a
decrease in 30- and 180-day mortality, rehospitalizations, non-home discharge and increase home-time for all
Veterans (Aim 1). The effect size for the outcomes will be greater for frail patients in certain specialties (Aim 2).
The concurrent FE will highlight key barriers/facilitators for future implementation (Aim 3).
Methodology: The PAUSE trial is a pragmatic, stepped wedge randomized clinical trial designed to capture a
cohort of 25,000 Veterans scheduled for elective surgery at 3 large tertiary care VAMCs (Palo Alto, Houston
and Nashville) and 7 specialty groups: general, vascular, orthopedics, cardio-thoracic, urology, neurosurgery
and others (e.g., plastics and ENT). The intervention will be frailty screening and referral to a “multidisciplinary
PAUSE board” (surgery, anesthesia, geriatrics, palliative care, case management, rehabilitation and nutrition)
for recommendations. Each ‘step’ will be a randomly chosen specialty group transitioning from usual care to
the PAUSE intervention. Outcomes include 30- and 180-day mortality, non- home discharge, rehospitalizations
and home-time. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will be used to guide FE
and analysis of factors that influence implementation. The study spans across 4 years for pre-intervention FE
(Y1), PAUSE intervention (Y1-3), post-intervention FE (Y3) and analysis (Y4).
Next Steps: The PAUSE intervention will result in development of an “Implementation Guide” for wider
dissemination and future implementation at other sites through larger funding mechanisms or operational
support. Future steps include formal budget impact analysis and study of health care utilization pre- and post-
PAUSE intervention in the VA system."
10836402,"Background: Cardiac device procedures, such as pacemaker and defibrillator placements, are common and
increasing as the population ages. These devices are life-saving for the Veterans who need them, but the pro-
cedures can be complicated by highly morbid infections and other adverse events, resulting in poor outcomes.
Clinical guidelines recommend administration of pre-procedural antimicrobials to prevent cardiac device infec-
tions and early discontinuation of antimicrobials after the procedure to prevent harms caused by unnecessary
antimicrobial use, such as kidney injury, C. difficile infections, and antimicrobial resistance. However, these
guidelines are rarely applied, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality, and creating a critical need for
research investigating strategies to promote adoption of best practices (e.g., learning) and de-adoption of inef-
fective and harmful practices (e.g., unlearning).
Significance/Impact: The research in this study closes an important gap in the care of cardiac device recipients
and advances several VA HSR&D research priorities, including implementation, informatics, and quality of care.
It leverages the strength of the VA electronic health record (EHR) and will provide important insights into clinical
informatics methodologies for expanding surveillance of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial use
to include outpatient and procedural areas. Investigators will also promote understanding about how learning
and unlearning processes can be leveraged to enhance adoption of clinical guidelines and de-implementation of
ineffective and harmful practices.
Innovation: The highly innovative, informatics-based audit and feedback system will advance the field of imple-
mentation science by yielding a new strategy for promoting de-implementation of inappropriate practices. Les-
sons learned about how to implement novel, real-time informatics tools and adapt and scale them will also be
generalizable to procedural areas with limited resources to support surveillance.
Aim I: Tests the hypothesis that a multi-faceted implementation strategy including automated audit and feed-
back, education of electrophysiology team members, local adaptation, and blended facilitation with engagement
of local champions, will improve adoption of antimicrobial prophylaxis guidelines for electrophysiology proce-
dures at three VA facilities, using a stepped-wedge, Hybrid III design. Primary outcome is adoption of guideline-
recommended antimicrobial use. Clinical effectiveness will be assessed through measurement of clinical out-
comes (CIED infections, AKI, and C. difficile).
Aim II: Measures the feasibility of using an informatics-based algorithm to measure outcomes and guideline-
concordance following cardiac device procedures at 78 facilities and tests the passive diffusion of reports.
Methodology: There is a major gap in studies evaluating de-implementation of ineffective practices. This study
has two complimentary aims and will address this gap by testing the utility of a highly innovative clinical infor-
matics tool developed using the robust VA EHR. The informatics tool combines feedback about best practices
and positive clinical outcomes (learning) with feedback about ineffective and harmful practices and adverse clin-
ical outcomes (unlearning) as part of a multi-faceted implementation strategy. Aim I will test the multi-faceted
implementation strategy at three VAs using a Hybrid III design. Aim II will test the tool’s scalability and dissemi-
nation throughout the VA and will identify barriers to expansion and potential solutions.
Implementation/Next Steps: The central aim of this study is to implement ways to promote best practices. Tools
developed during the course of the study will be widely disseminated throughout the VA to enhance the quality
of care and will be provided to key operational partners, who can adapt the clinical informatics tools to promote
best practices in other clinical cares with limited infection prevention and stewardship resources."
10821444,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis has higher mortality in infants than other pediatric age groups, is associated with severe long-
term morbidities in 30-50% of survivors, and burdens healthcare resources with prolonged
hospitalization and complex interventions. Rapid identification of sepsis and timely initiation of
antimicrobial therapy are critical to improve infant outcomes. However, limitations to current diagnostic
approaches include the heterogeneous, subtle clinical presentation of infants and limited accuracy of
laboratory tests. There is therefore an urgent need for strategies to improve the early detection of sepsis
in infants to improve outcomes. Our objective is to improve sepsis recognition by developing an infant
sepsis early recognition system that combines patient data with predictive model outputs to deliver
timely, precise and relevant information to clinicians and nurses. Our hypothesis is that the integration of
a predictive model with clinical data displays that improve situation awareness will improve timely sepsis
recognition and management. We will utilize the strong foundation of our preliminary work in predictive
modeling and existing data from our neonatal sepsis registry to produce novel methods to identify infants
at greatest risk for neonatal sepsis. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators from
the disciplines of data science, clinical informatics, neonatology, and sepsis/infectious disease research
to provide expert consensus recommendations. At the conclusion of the proposed work, we will have
developed methods that support the integration of clinical data and machine learning outputs into
decision support tools suited to clinical workflows. We anticipate such systems that pair advanced
prediction methods with user-centered design processes will have broad applicability to many conditions
and populations. This work will form the foundation for a future clinical trial to evaluate its ability to
identify infants at highest risk of sepsis and provide clinicians and nurses with the decision support
needed to improve their health and safety."

Eighty-five percent (85%) of cardiovascular disease deaths occur due to either myocardial infarction (MI) or
stroke, platelet-driven events. While antiplatelet therapy for secondary CVD prevention is well-established,
antiplatelet therapy is not commonly prescribed to prevent a first MI or stroke as the cardioprotective benefits
are offset by major bleeding risk. The well-established role of platelets in the pathogenesis of MI and stroke and
the lack of platelet-directed therapeutic options for primary CVD prevention necessitates investigating novel
platelet targets which would impact the multifaceted effects of platelets without impacting hemostasis.
Furthermore, while platelets were once considered primarily mediators of hemostasis and thrombosis, it is now
understood that they play an important role as immune mediators. Platelets play central roles in the chronic
inflammation that fuels atherosclerosis, from the initial innate immune response to damage-associated molecular
pattern proteins to the engagement of adaptive immunity. To effectively target this axis, a better understanding
of the pathways and cell-cell communication networks by which platelets promote atherogenesis and inhibit
inflammation resolution in CVD Is required.
By unbiased platelet sequencing, we have identified a novel regulator of platelet activation responses, CD37.
This proposal aims to understand how CD37 regulates platelet functional responses and how targeting platelet
CD37 may be a viable therapeutic approach to reduce (patho)physiological platelet responses.
In Aim 1 we will establish the role of CD37 in platelet activation responses and identify protein-binding partners
in CD37-enriched membrane microdomains. Aim 2 will assess if targeting platelet CD37 alters atherosclerosis
and plaque stability. The studies will serve as an essential foundation to demonstrate the viability of targeting
platelet CD37 to reduce thrombosis, atherogenesis, and systemic inflammation. If our hypotheses prove
accurate, CD37, our newly identified platelet activity gene, could be targeted to prevent and treat a wide variety
of platelet-mediated disorders, including cardiovascular disease."
10892785,"Polydrug abuse (especially alcohol use disorder, AUD, and smoking) are known individually to
compromise the lung alveolar-endothelial barrier (AEB) and the blood brain barrier (BBB). Very
limited knowledge exists regarding damage in lung and brain due to electronic cigarettes (e-Cig)
in combination with AUD. E-Cig have become popular, yet very limited data indicate that they
cause endothelial dysfunction and result in a pro-inflammatory phenotype in macrophages and
endothelium in lungs. While e-Cig are known to be addictive, their effects on the brain and
cognition are essentially unknown. Our data show that chronic e-Cig exposure in mice
enhanced permeability of the BBB and neuroinflammation, diminished expression of a key
glucose transporter and tight junction protein on brain endothelium, and impaired cognition.
Preliminary data indicate that the combination of alcohol/e-Cig exposure in vivo caused
enhanced AEB permeability and amplified neuroinflammation/BBB compromise. We found that
e-Cig and alcohol impair AEB and BBB via the same mechanism including mitochondrial
dysfunction, Ca2+ accumulation, and ATP extracellular release, potentially mediated by
purinergic receptor, P2X7, in cellular components of AEB/BBB. Using innovative in vitro 3D
systems of AEB and BBB and relevant animal models, we test the hypothesis that BBB and
AEB injury in e-Cig/alcohol exposure are mediated through the P2X7 receptor. In aim 1, we will
screen the magnitude of injury (mitochondrial dysfunction, Ca2+ increase and ATP release) by
various types of e-Cig in combination with alcohol on human brain and lung endothelial and lung
epithelial cells. Then, we will define mechanisms of demise using innovative 3D in vitro
constructs of lung and brain microvasculature, functional assays, assessment of mitochondrial
functions and expression of key molecules supporting BBB and AEB. We will investigate the
contribution of activation of the purinergic P2X7 receptor in e-Cig/alcohol induced BBB/AEB
dysfunction. The 2nd aim will study in vivo lung injury after chronic alcohol feeding and e-Cig
vaping evaluating AEB permeability, expression of barrier supporting molecules, inflammatory
responses (immunohistochemistry, protein/mRNA, bronchoalveolar lavage). P2X7 knockout
(KO) animals will allow dissection of the role of this receptor in pulmonary dysfunction. The 3rd
aim will decipher combined in vivo effects of BBB function, expression of barrier-mediating
molecules, and neuroinflammation. The same experiments performed in P2X7 KO mice will
determine the importance of this pathway in CNS injury. Markers of lung injury and BBB
damage will be measured in blood and correlated with signs of end-organ pathology."

Androgen receptor (AR) plays a fundamental role in driving the development of human prostate cancer. Most
current treatments against the AR-expressing (AR+) metastatic cancer aim to inhibit AR, e.g. the standard of
care with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), or new treatment with AR inhibitors enzalutamide (Enza).
Despite the recent advance, the efficacy and sustainability of anti-AR-treatments (ADT/Enza) are still limited
due to treatment resistance, which leads to tumor progression and patient mortality. New understanding in the
mechanism of resistance is therefore urgently needed. Tumor hypoxia occurs frequently in solid cancers
including metastatic prostate cancer, and has long been considered a cause of treatment resistance. However,
the exact mechanism is unclear. Recently, we have found that hypoxia confers ADT/Enza resistance via
metabolic reprogramming (Geng et al, Nat. Comm. 2018). This project is to further clarify the mechanism of
action centering on the cytosolic glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT1). In literatures, GPT1 is known as a
metabolic enzyme at the converging point of glucose and glutamine metabolic pathways, and many GPT1-
downstream metabolites are oncogenic and cytoprotective to cancer cells. However, the role of GPT1 in
conferring anti-AR-treatment resistance is unknown. We identified GPT1 through metabolic and transcriptomic
screenings of our anti-AR-resistant cells. Our new pilot data further showed that i) GPT1 expression and
activity were upregulated by ADT/Enza in hypoxia, ii) the upregulation was consistent across ADT/Enza-
resistant cells, xenografts, PDX and patient samples, and iii) clinical GPT1 mRNA correlated with hypoxia,
poor disease outcomes, and ADT/Enza resistance in patients. In this proposal, we will determine whether and
how prostate cancer cells use GPT1 to evade ADT/Enza in hypoxia and in vivo with cell and tumor models and
patient samples. We will determine the molecular function of GPT1 in conferring ADT/Enza resistance in Aim
1, understand the mechanisms in Aim 2, and confirm its clinical significance in Aim 3. Metastatic prostate
cancer has the 2nd-leading cause of cancer death in American men. New mechanistic understanding and
therapy strategy are unmet needs. The GPT1-based studies here may lead to new mechanistic insights,
paving ways to new prognosis and treatment strategies to predict drug efficacy, monitor the onset of
resistance, and prevent or reverse resistance."

 All organisms including humans are constantly exposed to various environmental agents that cause damage
to the DNA as well as other biomolecules, and thus threaten genomic integrity and cellular homeostasis, leading
to the development of various diseases such as cancer. During the past few years, supported by NIEHS funding,
my lab has carried out several screening studies, leading to exciting discoveries on the role of RNA modifications
in DNA repair, cellular homeostasis, and tumorigenesis induced by UV irradiation and arsenic, two known
carcinogenic agents. These results focus particularly on the most abundant internal mRNA methylation, N6-
methyladenosine (m6A) mRNA methylation. However, the major challenge is that how environmental agents
interact with the epitranscriptome in disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Based on the discoveries
made in our published work and our unpublished findings, I propose to test this overarching hypothesis:
environmental insults dysregulate the epitranscriptomic machinery and thus impair genomic integrity and cellular
homeostasis, leading to tumorigenesis. The focus of my R35 application is to determine the epitranscriptomic
mechanism of environmental stress response and tumorigenesis in biochemical systems, cells, and mouse
xenograft/orthotopic/genetic tumor models. As the research program evolves, we will then establish the
relevance of these discoveries in human samples. Furthermore, we will also expand our investigation to explore
how RNA modifications are modulated by other environmental carcinogenic agents, in skin cells and in epithelial
cells of other tissue origins that are targeted by these carcinogens. We will employ the novel m6A methylome
sequencing technology developed by our collaborator’s lab, as well as other sequencing technologies to map
the environmental epitranscriptome. In addition, we will continue to create new genetic mouse models to
investigate the role of RNA modifications in environmental tumorigenesis. My broad research program will pursue
the following goals: (i) establish the mechanism by which m6A RNA methylation regulates tumorigenesis
following UVB radiation and arsenic exposure; (ii) discover new enzymes that regulate m6A mRNA methylation
in environmental stress response and tumorigenesis; (iii) explore the roles of other RNA modifications in
environmental stress response and tumorigenesis; and (iv) identify new molecules that modulate RNA
modifications as probes/therapeutics. The resultant discoveries can vastly expand our knowledge to further
establish the role of environmental epitranscriptomics in stress response and cancer, and open up new
opportunities to develop new epitranscriptomics-based probes/therapeutics to improve prevention and therapy
for cancer as well as other diseases."

Glioblastoma (GBM, WHO Grade IV glioma) is one of the most common and deadliest primary brain tumors that
affects both children and adults. GBM is associated with significantly elevated mortality, and there are no
effective therapies available for patients despite many previous clinical trials. It is believed that a better
understanding of the cell types and factors regulating GBM cell properties in the brain could provide novel
insights into the pathology and reveal new therapeutic targets for treating GBM patients. The main goal of this
R21 proposal is to elucidate the role of human GABAergic neurons in regulating the proliferation and survival of
GBM cells in the brain using an innovative co-culture approach of human GBM spheroids and human induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived telencephalic organoids (organoid-GBM chimera). To achieve this goal, we
will use the most advanced neuroscience tools and techniques, including human stem cell-derived brain
organoids, optogenetics, rabies virus tracing, and single-cell RNA sequencing, to characterize the
communication between GABAergic neurons and tumor cells in organoid-GBM chimera and the effects of this
communication on tumor cell survival and proliferation. Our specific hypothesis is that GABAergic neurons form
functional synapses with tumor cells in GBM-organoid chimeras to promote tumor cell proliferation or survival
via GABA-mediated depolarization of tumor cells. The specific aims to test this hypothesis are (1) to determine
whether GABAergic neurons establish functional synapses with GBM cells to regulate tumor growth and survival
and (2) to determine the role of trans-synaptic signaling proteins in regulating tumor growth and survival. Overall,
we expect that this study will advance our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in
the regulation of GBM cell properties in the human brain and provide a novel framework for studying the
interactions of human brain tumors with human neurons in a human brain-like environment."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will provide a structured environment
with expert mentorship to enable Dr. Wesley M. Jackson to develop as an independent investigator and future
leader in the field of neonatology. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a common and often fatal disease
in infants. Mortality or severe neurodevelopmental impairment in infants with HIE remain high, despite the
widespread use of therapeutic hypothermia. As a result, there is an urgent, unmet public health need to
develop adjuvant therapies to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in this population. Caffeine has been
shown to reduce brain injury in animal models of HIE and may offer neuroprotection in infants with HIE.
However, caffeine has not been studied in the setting of HIE and therapeutic hypothermia in humans. Dr.
Jackson proposes to develop a population pharmacokinetics (PK) model of caffeine in the setting of
therapeutic hypothermia to characterize the effects of hypothermia on caffeine disposition (AIM 1). He will
utilize dosing simulations to optimize the caffeine treatment regimen to achieve therapeutic levels (AIM 2).
Finally, he will validate the optimal dosing regimen in an open-label trial of caffeine in 24 infants receiving
therapeutic hypothermia for HIE (AIM 3). Dr. Jackson developed a multidisciplinary career development plan to
develop skills in clinical pharmacology, population PK modeling, and trials operations. The combination of
structured and rigorous coursework with practical training provided by the aims of this proposal will allow Dr.
Jackson to develop the skills necessary to become an independent researcher and leader in the field of
neonatology. To guide him through this academic development, Dr. Jackson has assembled an experienced
mentorship team with expertise in clinical pharmacology, trials operations, and drug development. Upon
successful completion of the proposed Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award, Dr.
Jackson will have acquired the necessary advanced PK and clinical trial skills to pursue a lifelong career in
developing safe and effective drugs for critically ill infants. Further, he will establish a platform to systematically
evaluate therapies for critically ill infants in the setting of procedures or disease states which are likely to alter
drug PK, thereby advancing drug development in this vulnerable population."

Mouse models have served as a powerful tool in immunology research for decades, providing incredible insight
into our understanding of the immune system. However, in many cases, observations in mice do not translate to
humans. Constant microbial exposure from the environment generates in humans an expansive and diverse
memory T cell population, including tissue resident memory T cells (TRM). Skin TRM play critical roles in human
skin health and disease. Standard laboratory mice maintained in specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions lack a
true memory T cell population, including skin TRM, limiting their utility in the study of skin diseases where skin
TRM may be causal or contributory. Moreover, we now know that the microbiome greatly influences immunity
and inflammation, yet SPF mice have a very restricted microbiome. Recent ground-breaking work demonstrated
that laboratory mice co-housed with pet shop mice acquire a robust and diverse memory T cell population akin
to memory T cell populations in humans, including skin TRM. Moreover, data suggested that regulatory T cells,
memory B cells and innate immune cells were also altered in the co-housed “dirty” mice. Diverse microbial
exposure drove this dramatic shift in immune cell populations. Dirty mice could have a potentially profound
impact on the entire field of skin immunology, by serving as a more human-like mouse model for
translational research. As a first step though, the skin immune system of dirty mice must be well-characterized,
and these mice tested in models of immune-mediated skin disease. In Aim 1, we will thoroughly characterize the
skin immune system in dirty versus clean control mice of different strains, sex, skin site, and as a consequence
of varying microbial exposure. Results will therefore be broadly applicable to the skin immunology community.
We will use both novel and traditional techniques including single cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing,
high throughput TCR sequencing, high parameter flow cytometry and tissue immunofluorescence staining with
microscopy. In Aim 2, we will test dirty versus clean mice in innovative models of two immune-mediated skin
diseases, graft-versus-host-disease and drug hypersensitivity reaction. Ample human data support a role for
memory T cells, particularly skin TRM in both diseases but lack of a mouse model containing these cells has to-
date precluded mechanistic interrogation. We hypothesize that dirty mice will superiorly model these two human
skin diseases and will provide a novel avenue for investigating skin TRM and microbiome in disease
pathogenesis going forward. In sum, this innovative work is feasible, generalizable, and potentially transformative
to the field of skin immunology."

The emergence of bacterial drug resistance, especially in hospital settings, represents the next
great challenge in healthcare. Serratia marcescens, the Gram-negative bacterial pathogen with
intrinsic resistance to several classes of antibiotics, can cause infections with severe outcomes
affecting multiple body sites. This bacterium is also associated with complications of peritoneal
dialysis (PD) in patients with kidney failure. Importantly, Serratia-associated peritonitis
accompanied by massive neutrophil infiltration was shown to have the highest nonresolution rate
among episodes caused by Gram-negative bacteria, leading either to the death of the PD patient,
or catheter removal and transfer to hemodialysis. The progress in our understanding of S.
marcescens infections is hampered by the lack of reliable preclinical model, which represents a
critical barrier to progress in the field. The current knowledge of strategies used by this
opportunistic pathogen to colonize the mammalian host and to evade the immune response is not
complete, and only a handful of virulence factors were identified to date. S. marcescens is known
to secrete an array of hydrolytic enzymes, including sugar non-specific endonuclease; however,
the biological role of this enzyme during infection has not been evaluated. In this proposal, we
seek to establish a murine model to study the S. marcescens dynamic spread during
intraperitoneal infection and to test a hypothesis that an extracellular S. marcescens enzyme
nuclease plays a key role in bacterial escape from neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in this
niche. In Aim 1 we will characterize the bioluminescent S. marcescens spread following
intraperitoneal infection using in vivo imaging. In Aim 2 we will first evaluate the S. marcescens
extracellular nuclease potential to degrade NETs in cultures of neutrophil-like cells, followed by
infection study to determine the biological role of this enzyme in vivo. This proposal will advance
current understanding of Serratia pathogenesis and provide insight into the bacterium’s strategy
to avoid neutrophil-mediated clearance. Altogether, our experiments will establish a blueprint for
future studies of other nuclease-producing pathogenic bacteria."

 C-H activation is one of the key strategies to introduce structural and functional diversities into natural

C-H activating enzymes. In this work, we will conduct mechanistic studies of several non-hydroxylation
reactions catalyzed by non-heme iron enzymes, including endoperoxidation, epoxidation, dehydrogenation,
and oxidative C-S bond formation. These functional groups are key to the biological activities of many natural
products.
 In Aim 1, we focus on the distal type of -ketoglutarate dependent non-heme iron enzymes because this is
a relatively unexplored class of enzymes. There are two mechanistic models in explaining the activities of
these enzymes and we will examine them using carefully selected enzymes (FtmOx1, CnsJ, and PhyH)
because these enzymes all have two completely different activities. In Aim 2, we will conduct mechanistic
studies on non-heme iron enzymes in ergothioneine and ovothiol biosynthesis. There are two mechanistic

Many chronic inflammatory diseases, including periodontal infections, are biofilm-based pathologies mediated
by indigenous microbiota persisting within complex host-associated microbial communities. Determining the
environmental cues that direct the physiological state (commensal versus pathogenic state) of oral anaerobes,
is fundamental to development of therapeutic strategies for periodontal diseases. Recent studies indicate that
the pathogenic potential of the anaerobic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis is not solely dependent on its
ability to colonize and proliferate within the subgingival biofilm; its physiological state and its associations within
the microbial consortium are fundamental to development of pathology. The central hypothesis for this
application is that the availability of L-arginine is a key signal/substrate that impacts P. gingivalis surface
translocation, expression of virulence determinants, and biofilm formation. Studies have reported that the
levels of arginine increase 2-fold (from ~5µM to 10µM) in gingival crevicular fluid during periodontal disease.
The reason for this increase is not known but may reflect a decrease in metabolism by the microbial
community, a decrease in uptake by host cells, or an increase in bacterial arginine biosynthesis. One known
factor is the activity of the arginine - specific cysteine proteases (Arg-gingipains) produced by P. gingivalis,
along with its carboxypeptidase that releases the terminal arginine residues from peptides produced by Arg-
gingipains. Our analysis shows that both intracellular and extracellular accumulation of L-arginine has a
negative impact on P. gingivalis physiology, confirming that the levels of L-arginine are monitored and
controlled. Our studies have shown that under L-arginine deplete conditions, P. gingivalis down regulates
expression of fimbriae, inhibiting biofilm formation; and, in contrast, addition of L-arginine boosts fimbrial
expression and surface colonization. Thus, P. gingivalis adjusts its lifestyle in response to changes in
extracellular L-arginine. What remains unclear is the sensing and regulatory mechanisms that control this
change in physiology. The goal of this application is to determine how P. gingivalis controls extracellular and
intracellular arginine concentrations and in particular the effect of changes in arginine concentration on its
ability to surface translocate. Importantly, L-arginine is known to be an important modulator of the host immune
response to pathogens, so we posit that there is a delicate balance between host and pathogen responses to
arginine during disease progression and that P. gingivalis has evolved with the ability to sense and respond to
this key amino acid as a fundamental strategy for persistence. The rationale for these studies is that
identifying the signals that control colonization and the physiological state of oral pathogens will provide prime
targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Thus, the long-term objective is to determine if this
mechanism of signaling can be targeted for treatment and prevention of biofilm-induced diseases in humans."

Natural selection and gene flow are important during species formation, and yet there is still
much to be learned about how these forces shape the evolution of mutations that cause
reproductive isolation. The overall vision for the proposed research program is to use functional
genetic and genomic investigations to determine when and how selection and gene flow
contributed to divergence during speciation. This research investigates reinforcement, which is
the evolution of reproductive isolation in response to selection to decrease costly hybridization.
Reinforcement can be a critical step during the speciation process, and yet there is little known
about this process at the molecular level. The mutations causing reinforcement have not been
identified for any organism, and the effect that reinforcement has on patterns of genetic variation
throughout the genome has not been previously investigated. Three major goals of the
proposed research are to 1. identify the mutations causing reinforcement; 2. infer the
evolutionary history of the mutations underlying reinforcement; and 3. determine the extent of
and gene flow during reinforcement. Mutations causing reinforcement will be identified using
genetic association mapping near candidate genes and transgenic functional validation. Once
the causal mutations are identified, population genetic analyses quantifying and describing
variation surrounding the causal mutations will be used to infer how the mutations evolved
through time. Specifically, this research will examine target genomic regions for evidence of
selection, and determine if the causal mutations were from standing genetic variation or arose
under selection. Finally, this research will use innovative comparative genomic analyses to
quantify introgression across geographic space, throughout time, and along the genome of two
species involved in the reinforcement. This research will be accomplished in the wildflower
Phlox drummondii, arguably the best-studied case of reinforcement. Previous work provides a
clear ecological and evolutionary understanding of how and why reinforcement occurred. Field
experiments have confirmed that reinforcement caused divergence in flower color and two
candidate genes causing this divergence have been identified. This system offers a unique
opportunity to identify the mutations causing reinforcement and the signature of variation this
process leaves across the genome. Understanding selection and gene flow during the evolution
of functional genetic variants is critical to determining how all organisms, including humans,
adapt to changing environments. This work is transformative because it develops a novel
genomic framework for understanding selection and gene flow during reinforcement."

Approximately 10% of US adults aged 65 years or older take levothyroxine to treat hypothyroidism. Guidance
for its management has vast and important implications for the health and health care expenditures of millions
of older people. Levothyroxine has a narrow therapeutic index that requires monitoring of dosing through
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) testing. The current TSH reference range is based on the population
distribution of younger people, despite evidence for a shift to higher levels with increasing age. Furthermore,
observational data do not demonstrate adverse clinical consequences if people with TSH levels just above the
reference range are left untreated, and a large clinical trial of people aged 65 years or older showed no benefit
to treating this group of patients with levothyroxine. The trial of treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism used
low doses of levothyroxine because of underlying endogenous thyroid function. These data may not be
generalizable to individuals who have no endogenous thyroid function and rely entirely on exogenous
levothyroxine. Small trials in younger people taking levothyroxine suggest that there are no physiologic
differences between higher doses of levothyroxine that maintain TSH levels in the lower end of the reference
range compared with lower doses of levothyroxine that maintain a TSH level just above the upper limit of the
reference range. Our overall goal is to determine the clinical consequences that allowing greater flexibility in
levothyroxine dosing would have in older individuals who take levothyroxine. We propose to perform a
randomized, double-blind clinical trial of two 6-month dosing strategies of levothyroxine in patients aged 65
years and older who are already taking a stable dose of levothyroxine therapy, one to maintain a target TSH of
0.5-2.0 mU/L and another of a lower levothyroxine dose to achieve a target TSH of 5.5-7.0 mU/L. We will
assess the effects of levothyroxine therapy at two different TSH targets on symptoms of hypothyroidism, mood,
sleep, measures of memory and executive function, weight, lipids, and a marker of bone turnover. This clinical
trial will provide essential data to inform the clinical value of increased flexibility in LT4 dosing for older LT4
users. Implications include widening the LT4 therapeutic window, decreasing the frequency of LT4 titration and
TSH testing, and reducing the risk of LT4 overtreatment. In sum, this study could transform treatment of
hypothyroidism into an easier, safer, and less costly clinical practice for millions of older adults."

Treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (t-NEPC) is a subgroup of prostate tumors with poor patient
outcomes. Beyond systemic chemotherapy and palliative care, no targeted therapy has been successful
reflecting our limited knowledge of how NEPC is developed.
We have reported a t-NEPC-specific RNA splicing program driven by the neural splicing factor SRRM4, which
promotes t-NEPC development. This splicing program has genome-wide impacts on cancer cells as it
reprograms the functions of epigenetic modulators, transcriptional factors, and cancer stem cell regulators,
resulting in prostate adenocarcinoma cells acquiring neuroendocrine lineage and becoming independent of AR
signalling for survival. The FAK (focal adhesion kinase) gene splicing is a part of the t-NEPC splicing program,
whereby neural FAK splice variants are highly expressed in t-NEPC. In contrast to the constitutive FAK (FAK-c)
splice variant, neural FAKs promote neuroendocrine differentiation and AR-independent tumor growth. Further
RNA-seq analysis indicated that these neural FAKs act mainly through a hypoxic transcriptome via HIF-1.
Importantly, we found that when tumor cells gain the neural FAK signaling, they become vulnerable to FAK
kinase inhibitors.
These findings suggest that aberrant RNA splicing of the FAK gene promotes t-NEPC progression and that
targeting the FAK signal may provide a new therapeutic option for t-NEPC patients. We have developed four
specific aims to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will establish the clinical relevance of neural FAK splicing in
association with neuroendocrine carcinoma histology, castrate-resistant prostate cancer progression, tumor
metastasis, and patient clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, we will decipher the intrinsic mechanism by which SRRM4
regulates neural FAK splicing, and determine the extrinsic therapy-induced stress conditions that regulate RNA
splicing of neural FAKs. In Aim 3, we will characterize several FAK-associated kinase signaling that were known
to enhance HIF-1 protein expression through either protein synthesis or protein degradation pathways. We will
also employ global proteomic analyses to profile neural FAK interactomes and their activated phosphor-
proteomics that promote t-NEPC progression. In Aim 4, we will study whether FAK inhibitors can block neural
FAK actions in NEPC cells and test whether FAK inhibitors can be used as a combination therapy to block t-
NEPC xenograft growth.
In summary, these studies will gain new mechanistic insight into how prostate cancer cells develop therapy-
resistance and nominate FAK inhibitors to be potential therapeutics for therapy-resistant prostate tumors."

Neonates born during the saccular stage of lung development (23-32 wks gestation) are at highest risk for
bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a leading preterm birth complication. The mechanisms underlying this
vulnerability are poorly defined, a knowledge gap we consider foundational to the lack of curative BPD
therapies. To understand the irreversibility of arrested alveologenesis in BPD, we require a refined,
mechanistic understanding of the normal saccular to alveolar transition. Our preliminary data from 4-
dimensional live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics support a new model of alveologenesis in which
myofibroblast ring structures support the extrusion of AT2s (alveolar type 2 cells) followed by their
differentiation into AT1s (alveolar type 1 cells). According to our model, mature AT1s produce ECM proteins
and other factors that recruit specialized endothelial cells to become the alveolar capillary bed. Sequential,
spatiotemporally restricted signaling pathways, including Wnt and BMP, coordinate cell movement,
proliferation, and architecture. We have developed a neonatal injury model with a phenotype of impaired
alveologenesis that is relevant to human BPD by exposing neonatal mice to hyperoxia and inflammation during
the saccular stage. Our preliminary data from this model associate overexpression of Wnt5A/Wnt11 with
impaired alveologenesis. Post-injury deficits include decreased BMP production and activity in alveolar
epithelial cells and impaired AT2 to AT1 cell differentiation and decreased expression of extracellular matrix
(ECM) components by AT1 cells. Based on preliminary and published data, we hypothesize that
alveologenesis involves formation of a ring of myofibroblasts that express Wnt5a and Wnt 11 to drive AT2
proliferation and promote extrusion through the ring. Subsequent epithelial BMP production down-regulates
Wnt, promoting AT2 to AT1 differentiation and generation of an extracellular scaffold for capillary assembly.
Injury dysregulates Wnt and Bmp signaling, perturbing the precise spatiotemporal patterning during this critical
timeframe and resulting in arrested alveologenesis and long-term functional deficits. We will test this
hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1) Define the role of myofibroblast Wnt expression in regulating
AT2 proliferation and alveolar development; 2) Characterize mechanisms by which BMP signaling
regulates AT2-to-AT1 cell differentiation; 3) Determine the mechanisms whereby nascent AT1 cells
generate a scaffold for the developing alveolus. Successful completion of this proposal is anticipated to
transform our understanding of alveologenesis, identifying new molecular targets to promote post-injury
alveolar restoration and the optimal time windows for deployment of such newly directed therapies."

selective exaggeration of anaphylaxis to oral challenge with OVA compared to EC application of OVA alone.
Moreover, it results in exaggerated systemic anaphylaxis to oral challenge with BSA-TNP in mice passively
sensitized with IgE anti-TNP, indicating that the enhancement of food anaphylaxis was non-antigen-specific and
determined by factors beyond differences in IgE Ab levels or affinity. We propose to dissect the mechanisms of
SEB enhancement of IgE mediated oral anaphylaxis.
 Preliminary data show that enhanced susceptibility to oral anaphylaxis in mice EC exposed to OVA+SEB
is associated with elevated levels of serum IL-4, dependent on IL-4 and IL-4R expression by intestinal epithelial
cells (IECs),and accompanied by increased intestinal permeability (IP). Enhanced susceptibility is inhibited by
Divertin, a small molecule that suppresses intestinal absorption of antigen via the paracellular pathway by
blocking the recruitment of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to the peri-junctional actinomyosin ring, where it
disrupts epithelial tight junctions. This suggests a critical role for MLCK in food allergy. In addition, the data show
that EC application of SEB causes a massive influx of basophils in skin-draining lymph nodes (dLNs) that was
dependent on CD40 keratinocyte (KC)-derived IL-33, and T cells. The recruited basophils enhanced the ability
of dendritic cells (DCs) from skin dLNs to drive Th2 polarization. Pretreatment of DCs in vitro with IL-4 also
promoted their capacity to drive Th2 polarization.
 We propose to test the hypothesis that SEB from S. aureus that colonizes AD skin binds to CD40 on KCs
and triggers caspase 8 mediated cleavage and release of bioactive IL-33 which induces IL-3 release by T cells
leading to recruitment of basophils in dLNs. There, basophil-derived IL-4 promotes the Th2 polarizing ability of
DCs that have captured antigen encountered in the skin. These events drive a rise in systemic levels of Th2
derived IL-4. Increased IL-4 signaling in IECs synergizes with mediators released by MCs to promote MLCK
dependent barrier loss by causing redistribution of tight junction proteins. The resulting increased antigen
absorption triggers a forward amplification cycle of MC activation that exaggerates allergy to foods against which
the patient has been sensitized.
 The studies proposed will define the mechanisms by which S. aureus skin colonization aggravates food
allergy and will uncover a central role of MLCK in this disease. They may lead to novel therapies for food allergy
that would target S. aureus skin colonization, CD40 in skin, IL-33 and MLCK."

This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Iris Broce-Diaz, a neuroimaging genetics postdoctoral fellow at the
University of California, San Diego and University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Broce-Diaz is establishing
herself as a young imaging geneticist conducting clinical research on neurodegenerative disease. This K01 will
provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) gain proficiency in
machine learning and computational modeling techniques, (2) gain proficiency in clinical and genetic research
methodology for cognitive aging and complex spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, including clinical
characterization of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and other Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Dementias,
differential diagnosis, risk prediction, and biomarker development, and (3) develop an independent research
career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Broce-Diaz has assembled an expert mentoring team, including her primary
mentors: Dr Anders Dale (renowned computational neuroimaging genetics scientist) and co-primary mentor
Bruce Miller (internationally recognized behavioral neurologist and leader in FTD), co-mentors: Drs. Jennifer
Yokoyama (expert in FTD genetics) and Chun Chieh Fan (expert in epidemiology/biostatistics), and two
collaborators: Drs. Adam Boxer (leader in clinical trials for FTD-spectrum disorders) and Wesley Thompson
(expert in advanced statistics).
The goal of the proposed project is to develop novel imaging genetics biomarkers for predicting individuals at
risk of developing sporadic (non-familial) FTD and improving classification accuracy of sporadic FTD. Dr. Broce-
Diaz will achieve this goal through the following specific aims: (1a) utilize a polygenic hazard approach to develop
and validate a novel genetic biomarker for predicting age-specific risk of sporadic FTD; (1b) leverage pleiotropic
information to increase accuracy of the genetic risk scores and derive biologically-based genetic risk scores; (2)
use machine learning approaches to reliably and accurately classify FTD clinical subtypes and obtain
personalized atrophy scores from these brain maps; and (3) improve FTD classification by integrating atrophy
scores with genetic risk scores. This proposed study uses highly innovative methodological approaches for
informing FTD prognosis, diagnosis, and, ultimately, clinical trial design. If validated, these biomarkers will make
significant contributions by assisting clinicians in identifying patients at elevated risk for sporadic FTD and
assisting in diagnosing sporadic FTD in its earliest stages—reducing diagnostic delays, accelerating the
discovery of novel treatments, and improving recruitment accuracy in clinical trials. This K01 research project
will provide Dr. Broce-Diaz with the protected research time and opportunity to train with leaders in the field she
needs to master the skills required to establish an independent, patient-oriented, imaging genetics and biomarker
development clinical research program that will inform diagnosis, prognosis, and guide treatments of FTD and
other neurodegenerative diseases."

Natural navigation is an important skill that engages many sensory, motor and cognitive systems. Because
aging and degenerative brain disease both diminish the capacity to navigate in the real world, a better
understanding of the brain mechanisms mediating navigation will improve diagnosis and monitoring of
neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Neurophysiological studies in animals have led to fundamental
insights about the neural mechanisms mediating navigation. However, due to methodological limitations
neuroimaging studies of navigation in humans have generally been less compelling than the animal work. We
propose to overcome these limitations by using the NexGen 7T MRI scanner recently installed at UC Berkeley
to measure brain activity during a naturalistic driving task. Driving is an excellent target for fMRI studies
because is a common human navigation task that unfolds across a large and varied landscape, and on a
timescale commensurate with fMRI; it engages many navigational brain systems; and it is impacted by aging
and neurological diseases. Data will be analyzed by means of an innovative and powerful voxelwise modeling
framework developed in PI Gallant's lab over the past 10 years, and validated in many publications.
Computational models reflecting 33 different types of navigational features will be fit to the fMRI data
separately for each voxel and in each individual subject. Model prediction accuracy and generalization will be
cross-validated using separate data sets and subjects reserved for this purpose. The results will be used to test
dozens of specific hypotheses about navigation drawn from the theoretical and experimental literature on both
rodents and humans. These results will also be used to obtain a detailed functional parcellation of navigational
representations in each individual and across the group, and to identify functional networks that represent
specific navigation-related features. By combining naturalistic experiments, large-scale computational
modeling, multiple hypothesis testing, data-driven functional parcellation and functional network analysis, this
research will provide fundamental new information about the human brain mechanisms mediating navigation
and their relationship to prior findings from the animal literature."
10862731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Development of the head and face constitutes one of the most complex events during
embryonic development, requiring a network of transcription factors and signaling
molecules together with proteins conferring cell polarity and cell-cell interactions.
Craniofacial abnormalities are among the most common findings in birth defects.
Transcription factors (TFs) of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family have important roles during
human development. Mutations in the Twist subfamily of bHLH TFs result in genetic
disorders that impact the formation of mesodermal derivatives during vertebrate
embryogenesis. The basic HLH (bHLH) subfamily members can act as repressors or
activators, depending on their dimerization partner. The long-term goal of the proposed
work is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which TWIST bHLH proteins decode
genomic information, and how genetic variation modulates TWIST1/2-genome
interactions that impact craniofacial development. Mutations in TWIST1 have been shown
to cause the Saethre-Chotzen (SCS), Robinow-Sorauf (RSS), Sweeney-Cox (SwCS)
Syndromes and Craniosynostosis-1 (CRS1), while mutations in TWIST2 cause Setleis
(SS), Barber Say (BSS) and Ablepharon Macrostomia (AMS) Syndromes, all genetic
disorders that impact the development of the head and facial structures. Mutations that
affect a highly conserved Glutamate (E75 and E117 in TWIST2 and TWIST1,
respectively) in the basic region of bHLH proteins, which is responsible for nucleotide
binding in both class I and II groups, cause the most severe syndromes. The E75Q and
E75A mutations have been suggested to alter the DNA-binding activity of TWIST2,
leading to both dominant-negative and gain-of-function effects. In Specific Aim 1, we will
determine the binding affinities of TWIST1/2 and selected mutant proteins found in
patients by EMSAs, biolayer interferometry and structural studies via methods such as
circular dichroism, X-ray Crystallography, etc. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the
DNA-sequence specificity of TWIST1 and TWIST2 complexes (as homodimers or
heterodimers with E12 as partner). We will use in vivo (ChIP) and in vitro (SELEX) DNA
binding assays combined with DNA sequencing to determine the DNA-binding specificity
of these complexes and the role that specific histone modifications (both activating and
inactivating marks) and chromatin structure (using ATAC-Seq). Bioinformatic analyses
will be performed in order to interpret changes in gene targets between wild-type and
mutant proteins and determine the TWIST binding site sequences used to regulate gene
expression of target genes. With this approach we will determine the sequences of
TWIST2 binding sites used to regulate gene expression of target genes, since there is
published evidence that missense mutations in the DNA-binding domain of TWIST2
results in altered DNA-binding. Bioinformatics analyses will be performed in order to
predict changes in gene targets between wild-type and mutant proteins. This project will
contribute to our understanding of how genetic variation contributes to normal craniofacial
development and to the craniofacial diseases caused by mutations in TWIST1 and
TWIST2 at the molecular level."
10867375,"ABSTRACT
The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer cells is of grave concern, limiting the
efficacy of anticancer agents and, hence, the failure of breast cancer therapy. Clinical research and
application revealed that in spite of its potential anticancer effects, doxorubicin is highly toxic, and its
long-term application may cause dose-dependent irreversible cardiomyopathy, severe cardiac
toxicity, or liver damage, thereby limiting its application in breast cancer treatment. Even if the drug
is super-efficient, if it still causes off-target toxicity and damages non-cancerous cells and tissues,
the drug wouldn’t be a great remedy to treat that particular disease. As such, the greater potential
of using doxorubicin as anticancer therapeutic depends on the availability of a targeted delivery
vehicle, which will not only enhance the killing of cancer cells but also minimize the off-target
toxicity to non-cancerous cells. The goal of this study is to enhance the delivery of doxorubicin
by formulating an aptamer-labeled liposomal nanoparticle delivery system that will carry and
deliver doxorubicin specifically into chemoresistant Her-2+ breast cancer cells. We have
recently reported that down regulating nuclear expression of MDR1 P-gp (ABCB1 gene) by P-gp
specific siRNA could increase the delivery of doxorubicin to doxorubicin resistant breast cancer cells.
However, since the Dox was delivered as a free drug solution without encapsulating it into a particle
for targeted delivery, it still caused toxicity to other non-cancerous cells. The targeted delivery of
siRNA to knockdown multi-drug resistant genes such as MDR1 P-gp, MRP or BCRP might be helpful
to circumvent MDR using the apt-labeled formulations that we have developed in our lab, however,
there are some questions that still need to be addressed (1) how can we deliver doxorubicin in a
more targeted fashion to the chemoresistant breast cancer cells so that the drug-enhanced
cytotoxicity to cancer cells increases with a minimal toxicity to the non-cancerous cells? We assume
that a targeted delivery system is an utmost requirement whether it is delivering siRNA to silence
chemoresistant genes or an actual chemodrug which will kill cancer cells without killing non-
cancerous cells. To address the chemoresistance as well as off-target toxicity, a targeted delivery
system for doxorubicin needs to be developed which should be innovative, comparable and can
minimize the toxicity to other non-cancerous cells. And (2) a strategy needs to be in place to
determine whether the targeted nanoparticles will carry both doxorubicin and siRNA within the same
particles or in different particles to get the best results preventing chemoresistance and limiting off-
target toxicity. Our hypothesis is that delivering doxorubicin and MDR-silencing siRNAs separately
by targeted nanoparticle system will enhance the cellular toxicity and antitumor effects as compared
to a targeted nanoparticle system that delivers the drug and siRNA simultaneously. This hypothesis
will be tested through two specific aims:
Aim 1: Targeted delivery of doxorubicin liposomes for Her-2 positive breast cancer treatment.
Aim 2: Assess whether the targeted nanoparticles will carry both doxorubicin and siRNA within the
same particles or in different particles to get the best results preventing chemoresistance and limiting
off-target toxicity."
10854793,"Any human being has on average 5 million single-nucleotide variants and 13 million
nucleotides of insertions, deletions, and other regions present in variable copy numbers
compared to the human reference genome. Together these variants must account for all of the
genetic contributions to every phenotype of that person, whether it is their height or their familial
predisposition to complex diseases. While we can quickly measure the presence of these
variants in a genome, we lack the framework to understand which of the variants impact
genomic function or how they interact with each other in living, breathing organisms. A core
mission of the IGVF Consortium is to identify variants that impact the expression of genes using
single-cell techniques and computational modeling. Applying a single-cell genomics approach to
selected diverse mouse strains can make a powerful contribution to the mission and to
resources of the Consortium. Our Center for Mouse Genomic Variation at Single Cell Resolution
will first use 38 mouse Collaborative Cross recombinant inbred lines that possess similar levels
of sequence diversity to humans to identify variants that influence gene expression levels and
chromatin accessibility at the single-nucleus level in 8 distinct tissues. We will sequence
simultaneously a subset of single-nuclei with both short-read sequencing and long-read
sequencing to identify variants that impact the expression of different transcript isoforms in
different cells across the different mouse strains. We will also measure the relationship of
variants in these CC Lines in the response of macrophages in these tissues in response to LPS
stimulation. The resulting resource catalogs of cell-type expression QTL, chromatin
accessibility QTL, splicing QTL, and response QTL maps will be useful for IGVF modeling
groups; for characterizing important variants; and for use by the wider community studying the
function of these tissues as well as for designing better pre-clinical models of human diseases."
10839876,"Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic mold that causes difficult to treat invasive fungal infections in
immunocompromised and immunosuppressed individuals, often resulting in a lethal outcome. The objective of
this competitive renewal R01 is to build upon our recent work that has uncovered roles for bioactive lipid
mediators in immune responses during lung fungal infection with A. fumigatus. In the previous funding period,
we made three novel findings: (i) IL-33 receptor signaling negatively regulated immunoprotective type 17
responses during A. fumigatus infection, (ii) the eicosanoid PGE2 positively regulated IL-17A and IL-22 induction
and (3) IL-33 receptor signaling negatively regulated PGE2 production (J Immunol 99:2140-2148, 2017). In other
work supported by this proposal, we reported that deficiency in 12/15-lipoxygenase (12/15-LOX, Alox15-/-)
resulted in impaired inflammatory responses and profound susceptibility to lung infection with A. fumigatus (J
Immunol 204:1849-1858, 2020). Intriguingly, a mechanism of susceptibility we observed in Alox15-/- mice was
impaired neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow. Our findings overall have prompted some interesting
questions: (i) how does IL-33 modulate PGE2 during lung fungal infection? (ii) does IL-33 regulate the production
of other bioactive lipids? (iii) can bioactive lipids other than PGE2 modulate immune responses during infection
with A. fumigatus? (iv) are specific bioactive lipids required for or negatively regulate neutrophil maturation during
infection? Lipidomic analysis of lung tissue from A. fumigatus exposed mice demonstrates that IL-33 signaling
is a profound negative regulator of multiple bioactive lipid classes, including prostaglandins,
hydroxydocosahexaenoic acids (HDHAs), hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids (HEPEs) and
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). Data further shows the Alox15-/- mice have a unique lung lipid signature
during A. fumigatus infection, one that may function to modulate neutrophil-mediated immunity to A. fumigatus.
In other studies, employing Il33flox/flox-eGFP reporter mice and a combination of flow cytometry and fluorescent
immunohistochemistry, we show that dendritic cells and neutrophils are immune cell sources of IL-33 whereas
alveolar type II cells are the primary non-immune cell source of IL-33 in the lung during A. fumigatus infection.
Recent studies suggest that the cellular source of IL-33 (i.e. myeloid vs. epithelial) may have a dramatic effect
on the type of immune response. Overall, our hypothesis is that bioactive lipids, regulated by cytokines such as
IL-33 and enzymes such as 12/15/-LOX, tune the inflammatory response during A. fumigatus lung infection. The
specific aims of the proposal are: (1) to determine the mechanism(s) associated with and function of IL-33 and
12/15-LOX-mediated regulation of bioactive lipids during lung fungal infection and (2) to determine how the
cellular source of IL-33 modulates bioactive lipid production and immunity during lung fungal infection."

Current therapies for heart failure (HF) are largely directed at maladaptive extra-cardiac neurohormonal circuits
in a “one size fits all” approach. There is a significant unmet need for mechanism-based therapies directly
targeting the heart during early stages of HF. Increasing evidence has shown that during the development of
heart failure, mitochondrial generation of ATP becomes dysregulated. A well-established metabolic signature of
the failing heart is a shift from using fatty acids as the chief fuel source of the normal heart, to other fuels such
as glucose. This fuel shift occurs early in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and failure. However, the
potential linkage of this cardiac fuel switch to the progressive diminution in mitochondrial respiratory function and
ATP producing capacity during the development of HF has not been established beyond a mere association.
During the current funding period, we have made a series of discoveries that support the premise that
disturbances in cardiac fatty acid oxidation (FAO) contribute to mitochondrial energetic dysfunction and the
development of HF including: 1) identification of distinct “bottlenecks” in the terminal steps of the FAO pathway
setting the stage for depletion of key cofactors such as Coenzyme A (CoA) and diversion of reducing equivalents
away from complex I of the electron transport chain; 2) the ketone body, 3-hydroxybutryate (3OHB), an efficient
cardiac fuel that bypasses long-chain FAO, reduces cardiac remodeling and ventricular dysfunction in small and
large animal models of HF; and 3) increasing cardiac mitochondrial oxidative capacity, including FAO flux, by
cardiac-specific deletion of the gene encoding RIP140 (Nrip1) prevents cardiac hypertrophic growth and reduces
cardiac remodeling and dysfunction caused by pressure overload in mice. These findings have led to the central
hypotheses of this multi-PI R01 renewal proposal: Downregulation of FAO in the hypertrophied heart results
in bottlenecking within the -oxidation spiral leading to reduced capacity for mitochondrial ATP
production and; reduced FAO flux sets the stage for utilization of carbon sources from glucose and
other sources in anabolic pathways necessary for cardiac hypertrophic growth. These hypotheses will be
tested by two aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct in-depth assessment of the cardiac functional, mitochondrial,
proteomic and genomic response of wild-type, csRIP140-/- (high FAO), and csPPAR-/- (low FAO) mice during
development of HF in mice. Aim 2 is designed to determine the mechanisms whereby RIP140 deficiency defends
against pathological cardiac hypertrophic growth. The long-term objectives of the proposed work are to define
the mechanistic events leading to mitochondrial energetic collapse in the failing heart and to identify nodal
regulatory points that could serve as candidate therapeutic strategies aimed at re-balancing fuel utilization and
enhancing mitochondrial ATP-producing capacity aimed at the early stages of heart failure."

The long-term goal of this study is to determine how vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) regulates basal dopamine
transmission and methamphetamine regulation of dopamine neurons. Methamphetamine abuse is a major public
health issue around the world, yet there are no effective pharmacotherapies for the treatment of methamphetamine
addiction. Methamphetamine is a potent psychostimulant that increases extracellular dopamine levels by targeting
the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the midbrain and striatum. In the previous cycle of this grant, we shown that
methamphetamine competes with the DAT-mediated dopamine uptake, increases dopamine efflux via the DAT,
increases the DAT mediated inward depolarizing current leading to increased firing activity of dopamine neurons.
Methamphetamine increases Ca2+ levels in the dopamine neurons that enhances both action potential dependent
and independent dopamine release (i.e., dopamine efflux). We also found that neuronal depolarization induces
DAT internalization leading to decreased dopamine and methamphetamine uptake. Multiple studies have shown
that VNS increases dopamine levels in the midbrain region and reduces cocaine seeking behavior, albeit with an
unknown mechanism via a multi-synaptic connection between vagus nerve and midbrain region. We found that
optogenetic stimulation of vagal sensory neurons innervating the upper gastrointestinal tract depolarizes
dopamine neurons and increases basal firing activity of midbrain dopamine neurons lasting for at least 30 minutes.
Histological analyses revealed a reduction in somatodendritic DAT in the c-fos positive neurons. These data are
consistent with our previous report showing neuronal depolarization induces DAT internalization, that can reduce
the efficacy of methamphetamine regulation of dopamine transmission. Our preliminary data also revealed that
optogenetic VNS increases extracellular dopamine levels that does not reach ceiling levels, but it reduces the
methamphetamine stimulation of dopamine neurons, by depolarizing dopamine neurons, reducing DAT levels.
These preliminary data and the literature support the overarching hypothesis that VNS increases basal dopamine
levels by depolarizing dopamine neurons, reducing DAT levels, and decreasing methamphetamine-stimulation of
dopamine transmission thereby attenuating methamphetamine’s behavioral and cellular responses. Our proposed
studies will determine the underlying cellular mechanism for VNS-regulation of dopamine transmission and
methamphetamine-induced responses."

The prevention of Alzheimer’s dementia and cognitive decline in our aging population is a major public health
priority. Older Black adults are disproportionately burdened by Alzheimer’s dementia compared to other racial
and ethnic groups. Reasons for the increased burden are unknown and traditional factors, including vascular,
socioeconomic, and healthcare utilization, do not fully account for the disparity. Two important research
directions are needed to fill the current gap in knowledge regarding Alzheimer’s dementia and cognitive decline
for older Black adults, one of the most vulnerable segments of our older population. First, studies which collect
ante- and postmortem biospecimens from well-characterized older Blacks with sufficient cognitive follow-up are
needed to advance our understanding of the pathologic substrates underlying dementia. Second, the
investigation of novel factors uniquely tied to the lived experience of Blacks is essential to identify new targets
for intervention, policy, and therapeutics. The devastating effects of COVID-19 on Blacks coupled with the
increased awareness of interrelated systems of structural racism, have shone a spotlight on the importance of
race-specific stress as an understudied risk factor. It is well-documented that general stress has a negative
impact on the psychological and physical health of older Blacks, but few studies have examined the impact of
race-specific stress on brain health. The overall goal of the proposed continuation of the Minority Aging
Research Study (MARS) is to measure individual- and environmental-level race-specific stressors and identify
the biologic mechanisms linking them to late-life cognitive decline, incident AD, and other poor health
outcomes in aging. Leveraging harmonized clinical and neuropathological data from two other ongoing studies
at Rush, we will increase our sample size of Blacks to more than 1200 persons to address new Specific Aims.
We propose to continue collecting clinical and postmortem data on MARS participants, test the association of
novel race-specific stressors with cognitive decline and AD, and quantify inflammation and vascular pathology
in blood and brain, respectively, to test two potential biologic pathways linking stress to brain health in older
Blacks. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between individual and environmental race-specific stressors with
incident AD and cognitive decline. Aim 2 will leverage Medicare claims data to examine the relationship of
these stressors with other chronic vascular-related health conditions. Aim 3 will employ proteomics to measure
inflammatory proteins in plasma and examine their association with stressors and AD. Finally, Aim 4 will
examine the association of stressors with vascular neuropathologies and microglia measured in the brain, and
test whether these pathologies account for the association of race-specific stress with AD. The proposed study
provides a unique opportunity to answer critical questions about a large understudied segment of our aging
society and incorporates race-specific risk factors that have not been examined in clinical-neuropathologic
studies."

A goal of the cochlear physiology laboratory is to understand how the components of the organ of Corti tune the
sound induced vibration of the organ of Corti. A process known as cochlear amplification (CA), now the subject
of intense work around the world, has critical components not yet studied. Two questions of broad interest that
this proposal address are; 1) how does the fundamental hydrodynamic viscosity contribute to the unique
frequency analysis capacity of the cochlear apex where speech frequencies are processed and 2) does the
tectorial membrane in have a central and biochemical role in regulating the calcium ion concentration that is so
critical to hair cell function. There are three Aims.
New and innovative experimental approaches are needed to address these questions. For the measurement of
output variables, we continue to use the optical coherence tomography (OCT) method, that we pioneered, to
record inner ear tissue vibration. We use state of the art confocal imaging methods applied to whole organ
explant systems and measure calcium ion concentrations in quiescent and stimulated inner ears.
In Aim 1, about question 1, we also propose to determine if perilymph macroscopic viscosity is a crucial
parameter of apical frequency tuning. As well as whether the tuning is dependent upon the process of cochlear
amplification within the traveling wave as it propagates to the apex. To manipulate viscosity, normal perilymph
is replaced with altered viscosity perilymph via a real time perfusion system. Aims 2 and 3 are about question 2
where we seek to understand how and with what consequence is calcium stored by the tectorial membrane.
Involved is the use of mutant mural models of defective tectorial membrane structural proteins and quantitative
fluorescent determination of calcium concentrations in endolymph and tectorial membrane. Additionally, in Aim
3, we explore how age might factor into the tectorial membrane calcium sequestration via two models that
manipulate the physiology of the stria vascularis a known target of age degeneration. Model 1 is the chronic
application of furosemide, an agent to suppress endocochlear potential. Model 2 is the genetically targeted
chemical alteration of stria vascularis blood flow). Taken together the work will significantly advance not only
fundamental knowledge of organ of Corti function but open a path to pharmacological interventions to treat
tectorial membrane calcium pathology."

This proposal aims to develop and pilot test a theoretically-grounded, behavioral intervention to promote the
development of a therapeutic alliance between oncologists and Latino advanced cancer patients. This
intervention will be grounded in the theoretical model of the TA and a conceptual model of the TA in Latino
cancer patients that we will develop through the proposed formative research. Based on data from the
literature and our preliminary studies, this intervention will seek to improve oncologist TA by promoting trust,
empathy, shared decision-making, and patient-centered communication. The intervention framework will be
based on Self Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that behaviour change (improvement in TA) is more
likely when conditions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met. First, mixed methods will be used
to create a conceptual model of the TA between oncologists and Latino cancer patients to determine targets
for the intervention (Fig 1). Aim1a will leverage data from an ongoing funded multi-site, prospective
observational R01 on medical/religious/cultural beliefs, TA, and EOL care outcomes (n>270). For Aim 1b, we
will conduct in-depth interviews and focus groups with oncologists (n=9) and Latino cancer patients (n=35) in
order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the TA and refine our conceptual model. Once the intervention
has been created, we will then refine the intervention using stakeholder (Aim 1b participants) feedback
regarding its feasibility and acceptability. For Aim 3, an independent set of 8 oncologists and 50 patients will be
studied, half (n=4 oncologists, 25 patients) will be randomized to training in the TA intervention, and the other
half (n=4, 25) will be randomized in to usual care. We will examine feasibility (rate of intervention completion),
acceptability (oncologists’ and patients’ satisfaction), and efficacy of the TA intervention for improving the TA
between oncologists and Latino cancer patients, as measured by patient THC scores as the primary outcome.
Secondary outcomes will include engagement in ACP and EOL care. Dr. Tergas’s long-term career goal is to
establish a leading, independent program of research focused on the reduction of disparities in EOL care by
implementing and disseminating effective, empirically-supported interventions for use in clinical practice. As a
foundation for her independent research program, her short-term career goal is to develop an implementable,
evidence-based behavioral intervention for improving therapeutic alliance between oncologists and Latino
cancer patients. This K08 award application represents the cornerstone of her strategy to achieve my short-
term goal and consists of cohesive and complementary research aims and training objectives. Specifically, in
order to achieve her career goals, she needs training in intervention development and implementation science,
as well as continued training and mentorship in EOL care disparities. Conducting the research detailed in my
research aims will help me achieve this training and experience, as well as provide preliminary data for a future
R01-level grant application."

 Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a disorder of public health significance; common [300,000 global annual
births, over 75% in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)], with a high burden of morbidity and mortality despite evidence
based, effective interventions. Background: Sickle Pan-African Research Consortium (SPARCO) consisting of a
hub in Tanzania and sub-award sites in three countries (Tanzania, Nigeria and Ghana) and the Sickle Africa
Data Coordinating Center (SADACC) formed a SCD in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) Network. This successfully
developed a registry and enrolled over 10,000 SCD patients; developed recommended standards of care for
SCD management and facilitate skills development in clinicians, researchers and educators. A strategy for multi-
site research was developed. The proposed phase: will entail growth of SPARCO from one entity into four
entities, with SPARCO hub functioning as the clinical coordinating center (SPARCO Center) and the 3 sub-
awards becoming autonomous SPARCO sites, with addition of three more sites in Africa. Unique features and
innovation: Encouraging autonomy, whilst allowing sites to adapt activities to their settings whilst at the same
retain network cohesiveness, allowing knowledge exchange. Furthermore, the integration of health, research
and education is critical in areas with limited resources. Specific aims and approach: SPARCO Center will be
responsible for facilitating and coordinating activities in SPARCO sites, enabling exchange of expertise and
experience, sharing of resources and harmonize in order to implement SCD-related activities. SPARCO Center
has six specific aims, to i) provide governance, oversight and operations for coordination of collaborative sites,
by establishing a framework and procedures which will allow integration of new sites whilst strengthening the
existing sites ii) expand the SCD registry database by enrolling 21,000 new participants to give a total of 34,000
participants and collect follow up data. In collaboration with SADaCC, SPARCO center will continue to refine
database elements and harmonize SCD phenotype definitions. iii) support integration of consistent Standards of
Care into SCD healthcare through dialogue with institutional, national, regional and global health authorities,
Ministries of Health, public and private healthcare programs. iv) facilitate launching and successful completion
of cohort and implementation research studies v) support participation in training programs by strengthening and
developing partnerships with existing institutional, national, regional and international educational/training
programs and vi) facilitate engagement with public and private partners at different levels across the globe,
including sickle cell communities, public and private organizations in health, research and education. Expected
application of results: To reduce the public health burden of SCD by establishing framework for research
generating locally-appropriate evidence to address factors limiting successful implementation of interventions.
SPARCO center will facilitate provision of comprehensive healthcare to increase survival and quality of life, whilst
making a contribution to global scientific knowledge, enabling disease-modifying and curative treatment for SCD."

 Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) integrate diverse signals generated by hormones, growth
factors, neurotransmitters, and changes in metabolic state to modulate downstream signaling in all cell types.
IP3Rs are ligand-gated ion channels that are further regulated by allosteric and covalent mechanisms,
mediating Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The resulting increases of cytoplasmic and
mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations regulate many physiological processes (e.g., learning, memory, membrane
trafficking, synaptic transmission, secretion, motility, membrane excitability, gene expression, cell division, and
apoptosis). Furthermore, pathological dysregulation of IP3Rs and calcium signaling is implicated in cancer,
neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases, making IP3Rs promising targets for treatment of
these diseases. Despite recent advances in structural studies, fundamental questions regarding the
mechanisms of ligand interactions and channel gating remain mostly unanswered, in part because of the large
size and complexity of IP3Rs and the limited availability of specific pharmacological tools.
 In this proposal, we will (Aim 1) combine cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography
in conjunction with functional IP3R assays based on fluorescence-based calcium imaging to elucidate the
general themes of IP3R gating cycle and molecular basis for receptor inhibition by small molecules.
 Our recently published data revealed that the IP3 binding site is occupied by a loop that we have termed
the self-binding peptide (SBP), which is located distantly in the primary sequence. We hypothesize that the
SBP is a novel regulatory site in IP3Rs that can modulate the apparent affinity for IP3, and thereby Ca2+
channel activity, and that the divergence of SBP sequences between IP3R subtypes contributes to their distinct
regulatory properties. We will perform (Aim 2) functional and structural studies on IP3R subtypes and SBP
mutants to test this hypothesis and identify the structural determinants of this interaction.
 Completion of these aims will yield unparalleled mechanistic insight into IP3R gating and regulation,
potentially leading to the development of novel and specific pharmacological modulators of IP3Rs. In addition
to being used as a long-sought research tools to study IP3Rs, these compounds will serve as a starting point
for development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases associated with aberrant IP3R activity."
10917154,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is characterized by maldevelopment of the left heart and affects over
1000 live-born infants annually in the U.S. Neonates with HLHS undergo three staged open-chest reconstruction
surgeries to create normal blood flood through the heart. However, twenty-five percent of HLHS Fontan patients
(survivors who completed the three-staged surgeries) develop tricuspid regurgitation and are facing a significant
risk of death and heart failure. Tricuspid valve intervention may treat valve leakage, but the surgical outcomes
and long-term repair durability remain suboptimal due to the lack of mechanistic insights into the biomechanical
and morphological factors that influence the tricuspid valve function. Prior work on image-derived atrioventricular
valve finite element analysis has offered a sound computational framework for dissecting the relationship
between valve structure and its biomechanical function. There is, however, a paucity of ex vivo and animal
models of HLHS. As such, quantifying representative tricuspid valve tissue properties for patients in the HLHS
population remains a challenge. This limits patient-specific clinical translation of finite element analysis and
undermines the potential of computational analysis for guiding improved surgical decisions in HLHS.
 The objectives of this proposed project are to 1) discover representative tricuspid valve tissue properties
in the HLHS population using physics-informed machine learning, and 2) to evaluate the relationship between
tricuspid valve anatomic feature and the associated biomechanical indices (i.e., leaflet stress, strain, and
coaptation height and gap area). We will identify the tricuspid valve leaflet tissue properties for a subset of HLHS
tricuspid valves (n = 10 with trivial to mild regurgitation, n = 10 with moderate to severe regurgitation) and
establish an empirical distribution of the tissue constants. This will inform the level of tissue heterogeneity within
this subset of the HLHS population. We will also identify the association between anatomic features and
biomechanical indices for this subset of the HLHS population using 3D echocardiography-derived finite element
analysis. This will guide the design of customized valve repairs to improve surgical outcomes for individual
patients.

10897110,"This is a competitive renewal application for grant R01AG050440 (Diabetes and Brain Amyloid in Middle Aged
Hispanics; 09/01/15-05/30/21). The goal of this project is to examine whether type 2 diabetes (referred to as
diabetes from here on) and it’s antecedent, pre-diabetes, are associated with higher brain amyloid ß (Aß) burden,
the main neuropathologic feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), compared with persons with normal glucose
tolerance (NGT). We ascertained Aß in vivo using 18F-Florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) in 350
late middle-aged Hispanics from New York City, aged 64.15 ± 3.34 years of age at the time of recruitment, (72%
female). We also conducted 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to ascertain neurodegeneration and
cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and 18F-MK6240 PET to ascertain tau, allowing to assess the three main
constructs in the 2018 National Institute on Aging (NIA)/Alzheimer’s Association (AA) research framework,
amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration. We have had two key findings that form the basis for this renewal
application: (1) Pre-diabetes, but not diabetes, is associated with higher brain Aß in cross-sectional, and
longitudinal analyses. The lack of association between diabetes and higher brain Aß as compared with pre-
diabetes is in part explained by diabetes treatment, which was related to lower brain Aß among participants with
elevated glycemia (pre-diabetes and diabetes); (2) Females have higher brain Aß and tau burden as compared
with males in cross-sectional analyses, although females have less neurodegeneration and better verbal memory
compared with males. The cohort is now completing its 2nd wave of assessments (target: 315 participants). We
propose to complete two more waves of brain imaging at intervals of approximately 24 months with an expected
attrition rate of 10% per wave (wave 3: 284 participants; and wave 4: 256 participants), with improved
characterization of diabetes transitions, diabetes medication use, gynecological/obstetrical history in women,
sex hormonal profile, plasma AD biomarkers, and cognitive adjudication. In total, we will have four waves of
ascertainment of Aß, tau, and neurodegeneration in brain imaging and plasma at the end of the project, spanning
the 7th and 8th decades of life. Aim 1 is to compare changes in Aß among persons with NGT, pre-
diabetes/untreated diabetes, and treated diabetes. We will also examine changes in tau, neurodegeneration,
CVD, and cognitive performance as outcomes. We will also examine diabetes category transitions (e.g. NGT to
pre-diabetes) and treatment status as exploratory exposures. We will also explore how sex and APOE-e4 modify
these associations. Aim 2 is to examine the longitudinal association of sex with changes in Aß. We will also
examine changes in tau, neurodegeneration, CVD, and cognitive performance as outcomes. We will explore
whether sex hormonal profile and gynecological and obstetrical history mediate these associations. The renewal
of this project will continue to add a unique data and biospecimen repository that will be shared with the AD
research community for replication studies and to examine new hypotheses."
10862689,"Abstract
 Multiple genetic changes are necessary to convert a normal cell into a cancer cell. With a few
exceptions, the mutations or conditions (for example, DNA replication stress) that initiate genetic instability and
tumor formation are not understood. The goal of the proposed research is to use the yeast Saccharomyces
cerevisiae as a model for investigating the mechanisms that generate the various types of genetic instability
related to carcinogenesis. As an example of the success of this approach, our demonstration that DNA
mismatch repair mutations in yeast produced the same rate of microsatellite instability observed in hereditary
colorectal cancer cells was an important clue as to the causal mutation. 1. One of the proposed studies is the
characterization of a novel mutator that is responsive to base composition. We showed that a gene with high
GC content had a much-elevated mutation rate than genes with lower GC contents. We subsequently identified
a mutation (met18) that elevated the mutation rate of a high-GC gene more than 100-fold, with a much smaller
effect on other genes. The Met18 protein is a chaperone involved in the transport of Fe-S clusters into a variety
of enzymes involved in DNA replication and DNA repair. Our current data suggest that DNA polymerase delta
lacking the Fe-S cluster has substantially reduced processivity, accounting for the mutator phenotype of met18.
This hypothesis will be tested by our proposed experiments. 2. Fusions between centromeres are commonly
observed in tumor cells. We have developed a genetic system that allows the identification of recombination
events occurring between the centromeres of different yeast chromosomes. We will use this system to
examine the genetic regulation of centromere-centromere recombination. 3. We have recently used the
mammalian APOBEC protein, which deaminates cytosine in single-stranded DNA, to map regions of single-
stranded DNA in yeast cells undergoing DNA replication stress. Using APOBEC-induced mutations, we
propose extending our studies to map deletions and duplications in arrays of tandemly-repeated genes. Such
alterations are an important cause of genome instability. 4. Lastly, the Tel1p and Mec1p yeast proteins are
related functionally to the human ATM and ATR proteins, respectively. Mutations in both human genes are
associated with certain classes of tumors. Yeast cells with tel1 mec1 mutations have greatly elevated rates of
chromosome rearrangements and chromosome non-disjunction. The chromosome rearrangements, but not the
aneuploidy, are a consequence of a high rate of telomere fusions. We are testing the hypothesis that the high
level of chromosome non-disjunction is a consequence of defective phosphorylation of histone H2A in tel1
mec1 strains."

The primary goal of the UCLA NIH T32 GI Training grant is to continue to train the next generation of
outstanding GI academic thought leaders. The T32 program supports 6 trainees/year including Adult
and Pediatric GI fellows, General Surgery residents, and other UCLA post-doctoral trainees. The
T32 training period is 2 years except for the UCLA STAR (Specialized Training in Academic Research)
fellows who may be funded for 2 or 3 years for PhD's completion. In this competing renewal application,
the level of support requested is for 6 trainees/year. Our specific objectives are to: 1) Recruit and
train the most outstanding, committed, and promising trainees as specified above including
underrepresented minorities and women; 2) Support T32 post-graduate training at UCLA including PhD
or masters programs and graduate coursework. 3) Provide mentored research training by dedicated,
experienced, and successful faculty and also career development in individualized structured research
programs. We will accomplish these goals by: 1) Individualizing career development and guidance by
the mentors and other faculty career advisors through personalized advocacy, structuring independent
research projects, and graduate education. 2) Continuing opportunities for rigorous interaction of trainees
with UCLA GI leaders, successful investigators, and visiting professors as well as through enrichment
programs, annual scientific GI research meetings, and research workshops from the UCLA:DDRCC;
UCLA Departments of Medicine, Surgery, Pediatric, Pathology, and Basic Sciences; and the UCLA CTSI.
3) Sustaining a multi-disciplinary administrative T32 leadership structure that has been successful in
supporting and regularly interacting with the faculty and trainees, is highly responsive to trainees'
requests and needs, and has evolved through strategic planning and continuous feedback. The T32
leadership and UCLA program directors will also facilitate transition to junior faculty positions through
career development workshops and individually advising the trainees. These specific objectives are to
be implemented by an administrative leadership of four dedicated investigators: the PD/PI Dennis
Jensen, MD who is a clinical investigator, very experienced as the T32 director for 20 years; and
three co-Directors - Yvette Taché, PhD (a senior neuro-gastroenterologist and basic scientist);
Joseph Pisegna, MD (a physician-scientist in basic and translational research); and Martin G.
Martin, MD (a pediatric physician-scientist in genetics and basic intestinal luminal research).
There are 34 participating mentoring faculty and a T32 Executive Committee who provide excellent
opportunities for mentored research training, career guidance, and advocacy by insuring ethical conduct
of research and individualized training so that all T32 awardees are successful as physician- or surgeon
scientists and other independent investigators in gastroenterology."
10897228,"This K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Career Development Award describes a five-year research and training
program of the principal investigator (PI), Dr. Fotios Spyropoulos, that will enable his transition to independent
scientific investigation in the field of oxidative stress-induced cardiac metabolic reprogramming and mitochondrial
dysfunction. Premature infants are particularly susceptible to oxidative stress-induced injury and early heart
failure is an increasingly recognized complication of preterm birth leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
The PI has completed post-graduate training in neonatal-perinatal medicine and his long-term goal is to identify
the link between prematurity and heart failure. Thus, the PI’s proposal initially focuses on the characterization of
an adult model of chemogenetic heart failure with a plan to apply the skills gained from this award to future
investigation of neonatal heart failure models. The PI will use a novel transgenic mouse model (DAAO-TGCar)
that enables robust and specific generation of oxidative stress, in the form of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), in the
heart. He aims to delineate the role of oxidative stress in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction and heart
failure. He shows novel preliminary data implicating chemogenetic H2O2 mediated inactivation of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3)
in the development of mitochondrial dysfunction. To test this hypothesis the following specific aims are proposed:
1. Characterize the heart failure phenotype of the DAAO-TGCar mouse model, 2. Assess the role of Sirt3 oxidation
on cardiac oxidant balance and mitochondrial function, and 3. Determine the mechanisms of H2O2 mediated
regulation of cardiomyocyte physiology and energetics. This research has significance, as understanding oxidant
stress-induced mitochondrial damage may identify new therapies for the prevention and treatment of this
debilitating condition. The PI will perform the proposed work under the co-mentorship of Dr. Michel, expert in
oxidant signaling pertaining to cardiovascular biology and heart failure, live-cell imaging, and chemogenetic
applications, and Dr. Christou, an expert in vascular biology and cardiovascular physiology. The PI will receive
additional guidance from his scholarship oversight committee composed of senior scientists with complementary
expertise in cardiac hemodynamics and bioenergetics, mitochondrial biology, and experimental models of heart
failure. The training environment and the resources provided by the PI’s institutions, Brigham and Women's
Hospital and Harvard Medical School, are ideal for his professional development. The PI is guaranteed >75%
protected research time to devote to the proposed K08 program. Mentored research, didactic coursework, and
presentations at scientific meetings are all part of a detailed career development and training plan. The PI
outlines a timeline for completing the proposed aims, writing scientific manuscripts, and submitting a future R01
application. At the end of this award, the PI will obtain R01 funding and transition to independence by applying
the knowledge and concepts gained from this award to future investigations focused on identifying the effects of
oxidative stress on the development of the neonatal myocardium."

The predominant myosin heavy chain expressed in human heart, beta-MyHC, is encoded by the MYH7 gene.
MYH7 variants are well described in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and less frequently seen in dilated
cardiomyopathy. A recent series of publications link variants in the 5’ end of the MYH7 gene as implicated in left
ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, often in the setting of a dilated ventricle with impaired function.
Importantly, premature truncations as well as missense variation within the MYH7 gene has been linked to LVNC
in both population studies and in individuals and families. We now generated a heterozygous premature
truncation in MYH7 in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). When differentiated into engineered
human heart tissues, we observe the heterozygous premature truncation in MYH7 produces a phenotype
consistent with excess proliferation and reduced function, which are key features thought to underlie the
development of LVNC in vivo. We hypothesize that truncations and missense variants identified in LVNC are
associated with reduced contractility, rather than hyperdynamic MYH7 variants seen in hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Additionally, many missense variants in MYH7 are considered variants of uncertain
significance and methods such as those being used here may help adjudicate variants of risk. Through this
training program under the K99 phase, Dr. Monroe will evaluate missense MYH7 variants associated with LVNC
and evaluate their performance in engineered heart tissues. In his second aim, he will expand the search for
LVNC-associated MYH7 variation to the population scale using linked cardiac imaging and genotype data in the
in population datasets. As Dr. Monroe transitions to his independent phase, he will build from work performed
earlier in his train implicating the Hippo pathway in proliferation and specification. In Aim 3, he will detail new
disease relevance for the Yes-associated protein (YAP) in MYH7-associated LVNC using the models already in
hand and further developed under his K99 training. Finally, in Aim 4, Dr. Monroe uses unbiased approaches to
characterize human cardiomyocyte heterogeneity in healthy and LVNC engineered heart tissues in order to
better delineate the range of differentiation and identify additional downstream pathways that will fuel future
investigations. To promote his career development, Dr. Monroe will draw on the strengths of his mentoring
committee and primary mentor which will focus on expanding his management and his own mentoring skills. His
development plan includes formal and informal courses and workshops aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and
research productivity directed towards improving cardiovascular health."

Energy metabolism plays a critical role in human disease. Mitochondria, the energy powerhouses of the cell,
have their own genome (mtDNA) which is present up to thousands of copies per cell. mtDNA encodes genes for
proteins of energy metabolism. We (led by Liu, PI of this application) recently discovered that lower mtDNA copy
number in whole blood is an independent predictor for higher levels of cardiovascular disease (CMD) risk factors
in ~60,000 participants from multiple ancestries. For example, one standard deviation of decrease in mtDNA
copy number was associated with increased odds of obesity (OR=1.15, p=8e-31) and metabolic syndrome
(OR=1.14, p=1e-32), as well as with increased levels of several quantitative traits defining these diseases.
Despite these findings, the molecular basis underlying the association of mtDNA with CMD is unclear because
the nuclear genome (nDNA) also encodes many of the proteins engaged in mitochondrial energy production and
biosynthesis, and thus, maintenance of mitochondrial function requires extensive coordination of mtDNA and
nDNA. A mouse hybrid nDNA-mtDNA system was developed. Using this model, the researchers found
differential nDNA methylation, gene expression, and cellular adaptive response in hybrid mice of identical nDNA,
but with different mtDNA background. Additionally, we (led by Arking, Co-I of this application) identified several
significant DNA methylation sites associated with mtDNA copy number. In addition, experimental modification of
mtDNA copy number through knockout via CRISPR-Cas9 of TFAM, a regulator of mtDNA replication,
demonstrated that modulation of mtDNA copy number directly drives changes in nDNA methylation of specific
CpGs and gene expression of nearby transcripts. Based on these previous studies in mouse model and our own
research, we hypothesize that methylation and gene expression of nDNA mediate the effects of mtDNA on
cardiometabolic disease traits. In this proposed proposal, we will leverage existing resources, including whole
genome sequencing and multi-omics in six large cohorts of multiple ancestries; we will rigorously test our
hypothesis by pursuing four specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will perform association analyses to identify
mtDNA-associated nDNA methylation sites and gene expression levels, respectively. mtDNA features include
mtDNA homoplasmic and heteroplasmic mutations, and mtDNA copy number. In Aim 3, we will investigate
whether nDNA methylation and/or gene expression mediates the effects of mtDNA copy number and
heteroplasmy on continuous cardiometabolic disease traits. In Aim 4, we will perform integrative analyses to
identify gene regulation networks underlying mtDNA and cardiometabolic disease traits. We will also functionally
test the impact of mtDNA on these gene networks via edited cell lines (e.g., via CRISPR-Cas9 system). The
body of knowledge generated by this research project will deepen our understanding of molecular mechanisms
underlying mtDNA and cardiometabolic diseases, which will ultimately facilitate the development of new
modalities for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardiometabolic diseases."

Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 6 (CPSF6) is an HIV host factor recruited to incoming viral cores
during the early stage of the lifecycle. The interaction between HIV capsid (CA) and CPSF6 is known to dictate
the cellular determinants of nuclear translocation and influence integration site preference, but its impact on
overall viral infectivity is unclear. While overexpression of cytoplasmic CPSF6 has been shown to restrict viral
replication, knock-down of CPSF6 or disruption of the CA-CPSF6 interaction has been reported to have a broad
range of infectivity phenotypes. Recently, our lab found that knock-out of CPSF6 in primary CD4+ T cells
dramatically increases HIV replication with minimal impact on cell viability. This increase in replication correlates
with decreased induction of interferon-stimulated genes, contrary to prior reports that suggest CPSF6 acts to
shield the virus from immune recognition. In this proposal, we are testing the overall hypothesis that CPSF6
plays a critical role in regulating the innate immune response to HIV infection and that the virus recruits CPSF6
in part to circumvent this response. This hypothesis will be tested in three aims that broadly seek to understand
the mechanism by which loss of CPSF6 dampens the immune response to infection, the impact of HIV infection
on CPSF6 function, and the potential role of CPSF6 regulatory pathways in controlling infection. In Aim 1, we
will test the hypothesis that loss of CPSF6 acts to dampen the immune response directly by induction of
alternative polyadenylation (APA) or indirectly by allowing enhanced recruitment of Cyclophilin A (CYPA) to
protect the core from restriction by the antiviral factor TRIM5. CPSF6 normally acts as a member of the CFIm
cleavage factor complex to direct polyadenylation to distal sites of the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Inhibition of
CFIm activity triggers APA, which has been previously implicated in the regulation of the innate immune
response, and could explain the observed phenotype. Alternatively, there is evidence to suggest that CPSF6
and CYPA compete for core binding and loss of CYPA binding has been previously linked to enhanced restriction
and innate sensing. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CPSF6 recruitment by incoming viral cores can
alter overall CFIm function and induce APA. Regardless if this is linked to dampening of the immune response
above, it is well established that other viruses hijack the APA pathway to enhance their replication, though this
hasn't been explored during HIV infection. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that perturbation of the
CPSF6 regulatory network can control viral infectivity and the immune response to infection. CPSF6 activity is
regulated by post-translational modification and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling. Truncation mutants of CPSF6 that
force cytoplasmic localization have been shown to restrict HIV infection, and we will test if we can mimic that
effect by genetic and/or chemical perturbation of its endogenous regulatory mechanisms. Altogether, this work
explores a newly described phenotype for a well-known HIV host factor, CPSF6, and seeks to provide a better
understanding of viral manipulation of the innate immune response by post-transcriptional regulation."

The CDC reported that in 2019, 2.8 million infections due to antibiotic resistant bacteria occurred in the US,
causing over 35,000 deaths. Bacterial biofilms are responsible for many of these infections, as biofilms
confer resistance to multiple antibiotics via nonspecific factors such as exclusion of the drug and altered
bacterial metabolism. Multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a strong biofilm-forming pathogen, was
responsible for 32,000 infections and 2,700 deaths in 2019. Most of these infections are associated with
biofilms, and P. aeruginosa displays the nonspecific antibiotic resistance conferred by the complex biofilm
it forms. To combat the increasing threat of this pathogen innovative intervention strategies must be
designed. One of these strategies is synergy with currently used antibiotics. We employ high throughput
screens (HTS) of chemical libraries and screening of complex plat products to identify synergistic
compounds and substances that effectively eradicate preformed biofilms. A multistep HTS of over 6,000
synthetic compounds identified two promising candidates, triclosan (TRI) and oxyclozanide (OXY), that
synergize with the antibiotic tobramycin (TOB) against established P. aeruginosa biofilms. Triclosan is a
well-studied antimicrobial approved by the FDA. However it has not been studied for synergy with TOB. In
addition, a screen of plant-derived substances identified Larrea tridentata and a component of Hydrastis
canadensis as capable of eradicating preformed P. aeruginosa biofilms. Berberine (BER), a compound
made by Hydrastis, inhibited P. aeruginosa biofilms in our assays and has previously been shown to
synergize with TOB. We propose to test this synergy in a biofilm wound infection model, which has not been
done. We have now shown that extracts of Larrea, which is also known as Creosote (CRE), are highly
active against established P. aeruginosa biofilms, and we have shown this extract to be effective in a murine
biofilm wound model of P. aeruginosa infection. This model is based on in vivo bioluminescence imaging
(BLI), which greatly speeds the process of in vivo testing of biofilm infection in animals. Bioluminescent P.
aeruginosa form a biofilm on the underside of a scab over the wound, allowing quantification of the infection
in individual animals over time by non-invasive imaging. Here, we propose to develop the treatments we
have identified by testing TOB synergy of the compounds and extracts in the BLI wound model. This
process will establish novel treatments for P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in a rapid and quantitative manner."

Temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) are prevalent, with estimates of 5% to 10%, with two-fold higher
prevalence for females than males (NASEM, 2020), and projected annual costs of $4 billion (Stowell et al.
2007). TMD represents a group of conditions with and without pain, such as temporomandibular joint (TMJ)
disc displacement and degenerative disease. Osseous changes are late-stage, degenerative characteristics
(Farina et al. 2009; Luder 2002; Wiese et al. 2008) that tend to occur >10 years earlier in the TMJ than in other
human joints. The long-term goals are to elucidate the variables responsible for precocious TMJ tissue failure
and the predilection for females compared to males. TMJ tissue fatigue depends on applied mechanics and
behavior; that is, magnitudes and frequencies of energy input to tissues. Published and preliminary data show
that magnitudes and frequencies of energy input to TMJ tissues, quantified by Mechanobehavior Score (MBS,
mJ∙%/mm3), predict longitudinal changes in TMJ structures. It was found that in 35 subjects over ≥5.3 years,
TMJs where intracapsular diagnoses worsened had average MBS 8-times and 3-times greater than TMJs
where diagnoses improved and remained stable, respectively. However, there are anatomical and
psychophysiological variables that are more easily measured and clinically translatable. The Anatomic-
Psychophysiologic Score (APS), the arithmetic product of these measures, correlated well with MBS.
Therefore, the overall objective is to use an existing landmark data set from the TMJ Impact Project (Schiffman
et al. 2017) to evaluate these markers (APS) to predict longitudinal changes in TMJ structures and
intracapsular diagnoses over 8 years in 401 subjects (789 TMJs). The specific aims are to:
(1) Determine if easily measured anatomical and psychophysiological variables predict conversion rate and
 direction of changes to TMJ structures associated with changes in intracapsular diagnoses, and if there are
 sex differences.
(2) Test for sex differences in longitudinal changes in mandibular condyle volume within and between
 diagnostic groups.
The outcomes of these specific aims will help to address the current needs identified by the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2020 consensus report for ""new tools, metrics, and
biomarkers to diagnose TMD and forecast their trajectory.”"

Most bacteria are found living within complex polymicrobial environments where they must compete for
nutrients, space, oxygen, and defend themselves against exogenous, host, or bacterial derived antimicrobials.
Bacterial community dynamics and behavior can be greatly influenced by reactive nitrogen species (RNS),
which are important signaling molecules, immune mediators, and antimicrobials. Unfortunately, there is limited
understanding on how RNS regulate the structure and function of polymicrobial communities and what impact
this interplay has on host immunity, which has created enormous gaps in knowledge. Previous studies that
explore the role of RNS on microbial physiology predominantly use single species models instead of
polymicrobial models, which better represent the lifestyle of microbes. Our preliminary findings indicate that
commensal or beneficial bacteria induce the production of RNS to outcompete pathogenic bacteria and
maintain homeostasis within a host. Yet, there are no studies that have clearly defined the molecular
mechanisms that govern synergy between commensal bacteria and RNS, and how they dictate the pathogen-
host relationship. Over the next five years, the studies outlined in this MIRA application will use molecular
genetics, systems biology tools (metabolomics, proteomics, and RNA sequencing), and a Drosophila
melanogaster invertebrate model to determine how RNS regulate interactions between commensals and
pathogens and also elucidate what impact this has on the host. Critically the field of RNS as an effector of
bacterial population dynamics is vastly understudied yet is vital to understand because it has significant health
consequences. The findings of this research proposal will advance the field of bacterial-bacterial interactions,
as well as the role of RNS responses in controlling and modulating the host-pathogen interface. Our studies
could potentially provide valuable mechanistic data that can be harnessed for the development of commensal-
mediated anti-infection therapies."

Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to disparity in disease risks between populations. The genetic
causes of differences between populations are intimately tied to the evolutionary histories of these populations.
Therefore, a better incorporation of evolutionary thinking will help explain the disparity among diverse populations
today and improve clinical practices and personalized care. To this end, the Chiang Lab will continue to develop
an integrative framework combining evolutionary population genetics with genetic epidemiology in
humans, utilizing both empirical data analysis and quantitative methods development to better probe into the
genetic architecture of complex traits within and between populations. This integrative framework consists of
three main foci: (1) the genetic architecture of human complex traits, (2) the demographic history, and (3) the
adaptive history of human populations. Research in the first topic informs the genetic consequences on our
phenome today, while research in the latter two explains the evolutionary mechanisms through which variation
arise within and between human populations. More importantly, research from the Chiang Lab focuses not solely
on these topics, but also leverages information on one to inform the other. Within this paradigm, the Chiang Lab
will focus on the following three goals over the next five years. First, we will execute a comprehensive genetic
research program to address the health disparities in Native Hawaiians. Specifically, we will generate the
genomic resources necessary to accelerate genetic research in this population. We will then characterize the
demographic history of the Native Hawaiians to illustrate the benefit of conducting genomic studies in
understudied populations, perform large-scale meta-analysis in Polynesian populations to identify population-
specific alleles associated with diseases prevalent in Native Hawaiians, and engage the Native Hawaiian
community for future partnership and collaborations. Second, we will investigate the evolutionary etiology for
elevated risk in present-day populations. Using Latino population as an example, we will examine if the
elevated risk in childhood leukemia in this population is due to the selective pressure introduced during European
contact in the 16th century. Third, we will revolutionize the current concept of genetic relatedness by
introducing a new genetic similarity matrix among individuals that incorporates information from the genealogical
tree of the population. This matrix will improve the performance of a number of statistical genetic applications,
such as heritability estimation and phenotype imputation. While we used Native Hawaiians and Latinos as
example populations in this proposal, this integrated framework of genetic epidemiology and evolution will also
benefit future research in other understudied ethnic minorities. We are uniquely positioned to achieve these
goals because of our expertise in combining population genetic principles with medical genetic analysis and
statistical genetic development."

welcoming, engaging, respectful training environment that is diverse in all measures, where each trainee feels
that they have a voice and are a valued contributor within a larger community. We request four predoctoral
slots and two postdoctoral slots. This number of trainee positions requested is justified by the substantial
NIEHS and non-NIEHS funding of our faculty (averaging $498,701 total annual direct costs per person), our
success in recruiting excellent predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees, our successful endeavors in URM trainee
recruitment, the excellent publication record of the recent trainees in high impact journals (including Nature
Comm., PNAS, PLoS Genetics, Cell Reports, Environmental Health Perspectives, Cancer Research, J. Biol.
Chem., J. Neuroscience, Genetics, Plant Cell, and J. Immunology), and the successful transition of our past
trainees into important positions in academia, government or industry. The UCLA Molecular Toxicology
program is well supported by UCLA, which has committed considerable resources to it, including the
recruitment of a new faculty for a state-funded tenure-track position in the area of the molecular toxicology of
disease. Molecular toxicology is also one of the hiring priorities for another future recruitment. The faculty have
seven major foci of research interests: neurotoxicology (particularly the role of pesticides in the etiology of
Parkinson's disease), air pollution (the toxic effects of secondhand cigarette smoke, wild-fire smoke, and of
fossil fuels and their combustion products), toxico-epigenetics (effects of endocrine disruptors and other
toxicants), nanotoxicology, big data/computational toxicology, gene-environment interactions and susceptibility,
and alternative model organisms and predictive toxicology. These research foci are highly relevant to
environmental challenges confronting California and the nation. Renewal of the training grant will further
stimulate molecular toxicological research and training at UCLA, should encourage more students and
postdocs to pursue research in toxicology, and will signal the increasing importance of toxicology at UCLA."

Scientists seeking to understand and promote healthy aging must be able to integrate research methods and
findings that span from basic biological mechanisms to complex social phenomena. Our pre- and postdoctoral
training program, “Psychosocial Determinants and Biological Pathways to Healthy Aging” (Pathways)
facilitates this integrative approach. The overall goal of Pathways is to launch the careers of future leaders in
aging research, within and beyond academia, who possess the knowledge and skills to advance aging
science. We seek to accomplish this goal through two types of training activities. First, the Pathways program
provides individuals with the foundational training needed to integrate a broad range of psychosocial and
biological concepts, and to use advanced data acquisition and analysis methods in their own research. This is
achieved through our dual preceptor model, individual development plans, coursework, and participation in a
colloquium with peers and preceptors. Second, we provide mentorship in professional development issues that
are key to launching and maintaining a successful research program. This mentorship takes place through an
annual grant-writing “boot camp,” colloquia featuring both preceptors and outside speakers, and by providing
online resources (e.g., examples of funded proposals). The success of this new program, which has supported
15 predoctoral and 8 postdoctoral trainees to date, is reflected in the high number of trainee publications,
cross-disciplinary collaboration among trainees, funded grant applications, and placement in tenure-track
faculty positions. The Pathways program is administered through Penn State’s Center for Healthy Aging which
has a 50-year history of research excellence and of training individuals who have transformed aging science
and developmental methods. Our faculty preceptors are well-funded with strong records of interdisciplinary
research training, from the Departments of Human Development and Family Studies, Kinesiology,
Biobehavioral Health, and Psychology. We are requesting continued support for 2 pre-doctoral trainees and 2
post-doctoral trainees per year in the next cycle of the program, each of whom will be enrolled in the program
for 2 years. In addition, Penn State University has committed ~ $2.1 million to the Pathways program which
includes support for 5 additional predoctoral students, 3 additional postdoctoral trainees, and funds for program
administration."
10837837,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most incident cancer in men worldwide and despite vast amounts of
research, treatment of this disease remains elusive. The prostate is regulated by male hormones (e.g.
testosterone) that activate the androgen receptor (AR) to trigger signaling pathways involved in the organ’s
development and growth. In PCa, these hormones exert an important role in the onset and progression of the
disease, and therefore have been the main therapeutic target for PCa patients. However, virtually all patients
relapse and develop Castration-Resistant PCa (CRPC), the lethal stage of the disease. Therefore novel and
more efficacious therapeutics are extremely important for PCa patients.
 In the F99-phase of this project, the potential of sphingolipid-based therapeutics for PCa will be examined.
Ceramide nanoliposomes (CNL) are extremely efficacious in causing cell death of aggressive in vitro models of
PCa, and these liposomes have a therapeutic potential also when combined with FDA-approved drugs that target
the AR signaling axis. The working hypothesis is that AR regulates sphingolipid metabolism hindering the efficacy
of CNL in PCa. To investigate the relationship between the androgen receptor and ceramide metabolism, we will
specifically study (1) the mechanism’s by which AR regulates ceramide metabolism and how this impacts the
efficacy of conventional therapeutics in PCa cells and (2) the efficacy of novel therapeutics in preclinical models
of PCa to assess the translational potential of ceramide-based therapeutics for PCa. The novelty of the proposed
work will result in delineating novel lipid-centric molecular mechanisms in prostate cancer that can impact novel
therapeutics for patients with no current viable options.
 In the K00 component of this proposal, the impact of epigenetic marks in the regulation of lipid metabolism
in tumors will be determined. I will also determine how manipulating lipid metabolism impacts the epigenome in
cancer cells. Moreover, understanding the regulation between epigenetics and lipid biology in tumors will allow
for target identification and recognition of the key pathways regulating these crucial machineries in cancer."
10874636,"Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a key risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease, the leading cause of death in the US. Therapies that upregulate the hepatic LDLR lower LDL and protect against cardiovascular events. Moreover, the LDLR also plays a fundamental role in maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. Therefore, the mechanisms that regulate the LDLR are important to understand. Via an innovative genome- wide CRISPR interference screen, we identified CSDE1 as a novel post-transcriptional modulator of LDLR mRNA stability. In tissue culture, knockdown of CSDE1 is as powerful as knockdown of the targets of statins or PCSK9 inhibitors, the most effective LDL lowering therapies in the clinic. Moreover, CSDE1 also acts independently of these targets. However, both the mechanism of and specificity for CSDE1's effect on the hepatic LDLR mRNA remain unknown. Therefore, the overall goal of this proposal is to establish the role of CSDE1 as a specific regulator of the hepatic LDLR and circulating LDL. In Aim 1, we will establish the mechanism by which hepatic CSDE1 regulates LDLR mRNA stability. Because CSDE1 binds the 3' UTR of LDLR, but its effects are tissue-dependent, we hypothesize that CSDE1 recruits other factors required for LDLR mRNA decay. We will therefore establish the dynamic range of CSDE1's effect through overexpression studies, use mass spectrometry approaches to identify the additional protein components required for CSDE1- mediated LDLR mRNA decay, and place CSDE1 in the context of a natural compound, berberine, which affects LDLR mRNA stability through specific elements in the LDLR 3' UTR. In Aim 2, we will identify the role of hepatic CSDE1 in post-transcriptional regulation of the LDLR. We will use global translational profiling (RNA- seq) to evaluate the effects of CSDE1 knockdown and overexpression on the hepatic transcriptome. We will combine this with cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) studies to identify the direct RNA interactors, and their binding motifs, of hepatic CSDE1. In Aim 3, we will establish whether the effect of hepatic CSDE1 persists in vivo. We will use a mouse model to evaluate the effect of Csde1 knockdown and overexpression on plasma lipids and in vivo hepatic Ldlr regulation. Together, this project will identify the mechanism and fidelity of a promising new regulator of the LDLR, an extremely important player in the development of atherosclerosis. The results will establish CSDE1 as a promising therapeutic target. Moreover, they will provide insight into the mechanism of specificity of a general mechanism of mRNA regulation, with implications for fundamental cell biology and other disease states."

Complex disease and traits are caused by dynamic genetic regulation and environmental interactions.
Numerous genetic, genomic, and phenotypic datasets have been generated, including genotypes, gene
expression, epigenetic changes, and electronic medical records (EMRs). Currently, there is main challenge on
development of novel informatic approaches to effectively link phenotype with genomic information.
Specifically, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported several thousand single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) that are significantly associated with the disease and traits; however, more than 80% of
them are noncoding variants, making it difficult to interpret their potential disease-causal roles. We and others
have systematically examined how phenotypic variability in disease risk for a broad spectrum of disease
phenotypes can be explained by regulatory variants. Now, we hypothesize that such regulation will be in a
tissue-specific, cell type-specific and developmental stage-specific (TCD-specific) manner. Importantly, large
genomic consortia, like ENCODE, FANTOM5, the Roadmap Epigenomics, and GTEx have continuously
generated high-quality functional data for annotating genome-wide variants. The emerging single-cell
sequencing technologies have enabled us to examine how genetic variants affect cellular functions within
individual cells or specific cell types. This brings us an unprecedented opportunity to develop novel statistical
and computational approaches for deep understanding of the genetic architecture of phenotype. In this
proposal, we combine bioinformatics, single cell omics, deep learning, and phenotype and EMR data mining to
develop novel analytical strategies that maximally leverage information from both genotype and expression
from massive heterogeneous data, aiming to predict phenotype by functional assessment of DNA variation at
the TCD-specific levels. We propose the following three specific aims. (1) To develop a deep learning method
for variant impact predictor, DeepVIP, that maximally utilizes functional and regulatory data to predict the
causal roles of variants in complex disease and traits. (2) To develop phenotype-specific network approaches
to resolve genotype-phenotype relationships in the spatiotemporal manner and single-cell resolution. We will
develop a novel method, single cell dense module search of GWAS signals (scGWAS) and also a graphical
neural network approach, GNN-scTP, to detect driving roles of genes from single cell RNA-seq data. These
methods can effectively identify critical regulatory modules and genes in complex disease in the TCD-specific
manner. (3) To apply the methods to 16 neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders and related
traits, as well as broad phenotypes using Vanderbilt biobank (BioVU) and UK Biobank data – both have
genotypes linked with rich phenotypic information. Our proposal is timely and innovative to study the genetic
architecture in human complex diseases and traits by dissecting important genetic components, especially
noncoding variants, at the functional, regulatory, spatial, temporal, and single cell levels."
10863898,"Abstract
 Vesicant agents, such as sulfur mustard (SM), causes immediate pain, inflammation, burns, and/or
blisters, and corneal lesions often resolve clinically, however, in some cases, vesicant exposure cause chronic
and delayed mustard gas keratopathy (MGK), leading to impaired vision and vision loss. MGK can proceed from
the prolonged epithelial cell death-induced sterile inflammatory responses and subsequent delayed-onset limbal
stem cell deficiency (LSCD). Anti-inflammatory drugs, MMP inhibitors or anti-VEGF therapy have shown
beneficial in ameliorating the severity of the pathology, but a single agent or combined therapy of these agents
is not sufficient to inhibit MGK. Therefore, the goal of this project is to develop an effective countermeasure
against MGK with extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). To achieve the
goal, the proposed study will test the central hypothesis that MSC-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) exert sustained
effects in suppressing SM-induced pathological changes in the eyes by delivering therapeutic proteins and
miRNAs that target apoptosis, sterile inflammatory responses and NV, thereby preventing the development of
MGK. MSCs have shown to promote corneal wound healing in several pre-clinical models by protecting cell
death and suppressing sterile inflammatory responses. Emerging evidence indicates that MSC-derived EVs
(MSC-EVs) are a promising alternative to MSC therapy as they recapitulate a broad range of the therapeutic
effects shown by MSC treatment while being devoid of safety risks and infrastructure challenges associated with
live MSC treatment. Moreover, MSC-EVs have many desirable features of an ideal gene delivery system as they
deliver proteins and miRNAs from their parent cell to recipient cells and thereby, they can provide long lasting
effects than a single agent targeting inflammatory cytokines, MMPs or VEGF. Importantly, MSC-EVs produced
under microcarrier cultures have superior anti-inflammatory function and also carry a significant amount of anti-
apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic miRNAs compared to those from conventional monolayer
cultures. Therefore, MSC-EVs laden with therapeutic proteins and miRNAs can be produced with a scalable
microcarrier-culture system without viral engineering. Aim 1 will optimize EV-based intervention conditions for
the treatment of vesicant-induced ocular injury. Aim 2 will test the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in a rabbit
model of SM-induced ocular injury. Successful completion of the proposed study will provide valuable preclinical
data of MSC-EVs in SM-induced ocular injury and determine the mechanism(s) underlying the MSC-EVs action
in MGK prevention, contributing as the first step in a continuum of research that focuses on the deployment of
the safe and clinically feasible EV-based therapy. Ultimately, it will provide major therapeutic advances for
patients with SM injuries as well as a broad range of disorders have limited therapeutic options but share the
similar sterile inflammatory background and LSCD."

Exposure to toxic organophosphorus (OP) compounds in the form of insecticides or chemical warfare nerve
agents (CWNAs) remains a persistent concern for both civilian and military populations. One countermeasure
to OP exposure that has been shown to be effective in animal models is the use of intravenously administered
butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which scavenges free OP molecules in the bloodstream. A significant limitation
of BChE, however, is that it simply binds OP compounds stoichiometrically, resulting in the inactivation of both
molecules. The resulting requirement for large doses of BChE is exacerbated by difficulties associated with its
manufacture, thereby complicating its use as an OP defense measure. An important advance would therefore
be the modification of the human BChE enzyme to enable catalytic degradation of OP compounds, thus
providing a therapeutic enzyme with minimal potential immunogenicity. Several lines of evidence support the
feasibility of this approach: microbial enzymes that exhibit high OP hydrolysis activity are known, and studies
by our lab and others have shown that BChE can be made modestly catalytic for OP hydrolysis through the
introduction of mutations or by adding certain oxime compounds. With this in mind, our ultimate goal is to
develop catalytic human BChE enzymes that can functionally mimic microbial or oxime-coupled OP
degradation reactions, but which also exhibit long serum half-lives, negligible side effects, and minimal
immunogenicity. A critical and novel aspect of our work is the rational introduction of a zinc-binding site within
the substrate gorge of the BChE enzyme, which is designed to mimic the catalytic center of the highly efficient
bacterial organophosphate hydrolase (OPH) and other engineered hydrolytic zinc enzymes. Three basic
design strategies are described for initial evaluation, while additional and subsequent optimized mutants will be
developed through multiscale computer-guided design. BChE mutants will be expressed in HEK293E cells,
which we have successfully used to produce properly glycosylated BChE tetramers in quantities sufficient for
characterization. Evaluation of the metal binding site will be assessed through spectroscopic and analytical
techniques, while hydrolytic reactivity towards a range of OP model compounds will be measured through
colorimetric assays. Due to their enhanced safety profiles, these engineered enzymes would provide
enhancements to conventional clinical interventions for acute OP exposures, especially when combined with
post-exposure oxime treatments. In future work, these studies will be used to optimize BChE metalloenzymes
that are effective against highly toxic and difficult-to-assay targets, for which evolutionary approaches are
intractable, and ultimately develop effective formulations for storage and delivery for post-exposure indications.
The goal of the introductory work proposed here is the initial development and validation of our experimental
platform for designing and evaluating small sets of clinically relevant hybrid BChE metalloenzymes."
10836492,"The long-term goal of the proposed research project is to improve the health of minoritized racial and
ethnic birthing people by reducing racial and ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity and maternal
mortality. Specifically, the proposed research project will assess the effectiveness of 3 significant health
insurance expansion policies in reducing racial and ethnic disparities in severe maternal morbidity
(SMM): 1) the 2010 Dependent Coverage Provision under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA), requiring private health insurers to allow young adults to remain on their parent’s plan until their 26th
birthday; 2) the 2014 ACA Medicaid expansion, giving states the option to expand Medicaid coverage to non-
elderly adults with incomes up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level; and 3) the Maintenance of Effort of the
2020 Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) temporarily maintaining Medicaid coverage beyond
60-days postpartum as long the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency is in place.
 Minoritized racial and ethnic birthing people are three times more likely than non-Hispanic White people
to experience SMM during childbirth and the postpartum. Addressing racial and ethnic disparities in SMM
is recognized as an urgent public health priority. SMM refers to unintended serious complications of labor
and delivery and is associated with substantially increased risk of maternal death. Providing continuous health
insurance coverage through health policies, from preconception to 1-year postpartum, is a suggested
intervention to mitigate these disparities. Up to 80% of minoritized racial and ethnic birthing people do not have
such continuous coverage. However, evidence linking health insurance policy changes to reduced racial
and ethnic disparities in SMM is scant. The 2010 ACA Dependent Coverage Provision, the 2014 ACA
Medicaid expansion, and the 2020 FFCRA Maintenance of Effort present three natural experiments for
assessing the effectiveness of expanding health insurance coverage in reducing racial and ethnic disparities in
SMM. The proposed project will test a series of hypotheses related to the specific aims, including: 1) Expanded
access to private health insurance for people under age 26 is associated with reduced racial and ethnic
disparities in SMM; 2) Expanded Medicaid coverage for low-income people is associated with reduced racial
and ethnic disparities in SMM, and 3) Extending Medicaid coverage for low-income people from 60-day to 1-
year postpartum is associated with reduced racial and ethnic disparities in postpartum SMM. National and
state data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, will
be analyzed using robust quasi-experimental approaches such as the difference-in-difference-in-differences.
 Results of this project will help close important gaps in health disparities research and provide
rigorous evidence to inform policy interventions to reduce racial and ethnic health disparities among
birthing people. It aligns with the aims of the IMPROVE initiative of the National Institutes of Health."

One in 3 American men will develop bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms in their lifetime, and the majority
will be attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). Older men with LUTS/BPH have increased risk
of developing new mobility limitations, falls, fractures, disability, and death. Unfortunately, current LUTS/BPH
medications targeting prostate-centric mechanisms likely further increase risk of some of these adverse clinical
outcomes, have modest efficacy, and poor adherence. Frailty-related mechanisms are novel LUTS/BPH
intervention targets that may be preventable or modifiable via an exercise intervention. Our team has
previously created an individualized, remotely-monitored, and home-based exercise program based on well-
known behavioral change principles and prioritization of scalable interventions requiring minimal equipment for
older men with prostate cancer. However, a pilot study is required to determine the feasibility and optimal trial
design for testing this exercise intervention in physically inactive older men with LUTS/BPH.
We therefore propose a single-center pilot randomized controlled trial among 68 physically inactive older men
with LUTS/BPH of a 12-week multicomponent exercise intervention versus health education control. The
exercise intervention includes personalized written and pictorial instructions on aerobic and resistance
exercises, supported by weekly one-on-one coaching by phone or video call, along with heart rate monitor
biofeedback and the provision of limited equipment. The following aims must be addressed prior to conducting
an adequately powered efficacy trial: Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and safety of a
remote exercise intervention and health education control among physically inactive older men with LUTS/BPH
(N=68 total) 34/arm); Aim 2: Assess the magnitude, variability, and durability of changes in LUTS, urologic and
physical function, and actigraphy measures after a 12-week exercise intervention or health education control;
and Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of detecting exercise-induced change in novel frailty-related mechanistic
measures (total muscle mass, mitochondrial function, urine α1-microglobulin). This project is innovative
because it leverages a remote exercise intervention with pleotropic and systemic effects across multiple organ
systems, in contrast to existing prostate-centric pharmacological and surgical therapies with side effects that
are critical to avoid in older men. Our project will accomplish the extensive feasibility work that is required for
both a future efficacy trial and the frailty-related mechanistic biomarker measurements.
This pilot study is an important step towards an extended, fully-powered efficacy trial with a secondary focus
on frailty-related mechanisms of an exercise intervention for treating LUTS/BPH. This future efficacy trial has
the potential to transform both the clinical care for physically inactive older men with LUTS/BPH while
simultaneously increasing our understanding of how exercise affects frailty-related LUTS/BPH mechanisms."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) elicit anti-tumor immunity by blocking various regulatory axes that
normally dampen the capacity of T lymphocytes to target tumor cells. While ICI therapies have
revolutionized the field of oncology by providing treatment options for otherwise intractable tumors, only
a subset of patients experience meaningful clinical benefits, while adverse inflammatory and
autoimmune toxicities often occur. To improve treatment outcomes, efforts have been underway to
establish biomarkers that can predict both therapeutic, as well as adverse responsiveness to particular
ICIs. The most recently FDA-approved ICI is a monoclonal antibody that targets Lymphocyte Activation
Gene-3 (anti-LAG3, relatlimab), which is expressed on many immune cell types. Knowledge of LAG3's
mechanism of action is mainly limited to its intrinsic role in regulating the function of T cells. Thus,
understanding the intrinsic role of LAG3 in other immune cells that are critical for programming anti-
tumor immunity as well as pathologic inflammation should provide important insights into how anti-
LAG3 elicits both beneficial therapeutic, and adverse patient responses. This project seeks to fill this
critical knowledge gap based on our two key preliminary findings. First, Lag3 plays an intrinsic role in
murine antigen presenting dendritic cells (DCs) to limit their activation and capacity to prime naive T
cells to proliferate and develop effector functionality. Second, human patients with plasma LAG3
deficiency have decreased levels of circulating IL-10, and increased risk for cardiovascular disease.
This forms the basis of our central hypothesis that Lag3-deficient DCs have an enhanced capacity to
prime tumor-specific effector T cells, leading to reduced tumor growth, but also adverse vascular
inflammation. This will be tested using two novel and complimentary genome-edited mouse models of
DC-conditional Lag3 expression. Specifically, Aim 1 will determine the DC-intrinsic role of Lag3 in
priming effector T cells and anti-tumor immunity in a melanoma model, while Aim 2 will analyze how
the interaction between hypercholesterolemia and Lag3 deficiency impacts both ICI cancer therapy
efficacy as well as induced adverse cardiovascular inflammation. In accomplishing these aims, we will
add a new dimension to our mechanistic understanding of the clinically relevant immunotherapeutic
target Lag3, identify potential biomarkers to predict responsiveness to anti-LAG3 therapy, and establish
an experimental framework for future studies to develop strategies to minimize adverse cardiovascular
pathology caused by blocking LAG3, while maintaining anti-tumor immunity."
10804741,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mitochondrial glutaminases (GLS and GLS2) catalyze the hydrolysis of glutamine to glutamate and ammonium,
a metabolic reaction that is critical for numerous aspects of mammalian physiology. Whereas GLS2 expression
is largely restricted to the liver, GLS is ubiquitously expressed, with particularly high levels in the kidney, digestive
tract, and brain. Its roles include the regulation of systemic acid-base homeostasis and the biosynthesis of
excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Accordingly, human inborn errors of metabolism involving mutation
of the GLS gene have severe phenotypes, including neural excitotoxicity and lethal neonatal encephalopathy. In
addition to its functions in organismal health, dysregulated GLS activity has been implicated in a spectrum of
human pathologies, ranging from neurodegeneration to cancer. Consequently, there have been intensive efforts
to develop selective allosteric inhibitors of GLS, one of which is now being evaluated in clinical trials for the
treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. However, results to date indicate that the rapid development
of resistance limits the efficacy of this therapeutic strategy. Remarkably, despite the long history of GLS research,
it is not understood how the activity of this enzyme is regulated in cells. Purified recombinant GLS has minimal
catalytic activity, and vastly supraphysiological concentrations of inorganic phosphate (100-150 mM) are required
to activate GLS in vitro. We have recently discovered that that the bioactive phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA)
is an extremely potent activator of GLS, approximately 107-fold more potent than inorganic phosphate.
Importantly, we have found that PA can activate GLS even in the presence of clinical GLS inhibitors, thus
rendering these drugs ineffective. In this project, we propose to define the molecular mechanism by which PA
activates GLS, and then to probe the upstream regulation of mitochondrial PA signaling, with the ultimate goal
of perturbing this process to overcome resistance to GLS inhibitors. In the course of these studies, we will
develop new chemical probes for investigating the PA-GLS interaction, including phosphorus-based covalent
capture probes to determine the binding site of the PA phosphomonoester head group. We will then conduct a
screen to identify additional potential metabolite-GLS interactions, and functionally validate any ‘hits’ obtained.
In the second Aim, we will build on preliminary data that strongly implicate the PA-generating enzyme
phospholipase D2 (PLD2), as well as the uncharacterized protein PLD5, in the regulation of the mitochondrial
PA-GLS axis. We will attempt to determine the function of PLD5, focusing on whether its reported interaction
with PLD2 regulates either the activity or subcellular localization of the latter. Finally, since our preliminary data
indicate that PLD2/5 mediate resistance to clinical GLS inhibitors, we will test whether pharmacological or genetic
blockade of PLD2 or PLD5 can overcome this resistance mechanism. Thus, our proposed studies will define the
physiological processes that regulate GLS activity, and will then apply this knowledge to identify opportunities
for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic strategies targeting glutamine metabolism."
10870192,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is fundamental to normal cellular homeostasis. The current
model in the field of biology is that mRNAs exist primarily as ‘full-length’ molecules that are ‘protected’ from
decay by ribosomes during translation. The long-established understanding is that mRNA decay is initiated by
deadenylation followed by decapping and subsequent exonucleolytic decay from both ends. Co-translational
mRNA decay is known to occur mainly in defective mRNAs. Existing next-generation sequencing methods that
profile mRNA decay target either the 5’ or 3’ ends, thus missing information about the other end that could
illuminate new insights into mRNA decay. During my post-doctoral training, I developed several novel
transcriptome-wide sequencing methods that concurrently select both ends of mRNAs. I discovered a novel
mechanism of co-translational decay of canonical mRNAs that involves repeated endonucleolytic cleavage
events, mediated by translating ribosomes that we named “ribothrypsis”. Ribothrypsis is conserved between
humans and yeast. We identified the unexpected ribosome-phased mRNAs fragmentation and found that
deadenylation is not a prerequisite for mRNA decay. Our discovery of ribothrypsis revealed that co-translational
mRNA decay is more widespread than previously thought. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
ribothrypsis is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for modulating gene expression that can be triggered by
numerous factors to recruit an unknown endonuclease that we termed “ribothrypsin”. We propose here to
capitalize on our past discoveries and leverage cutting-edge novel RNA sequencing methods to achieve a
comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of ribothrypsis and its regulation. In this
proposal, we will investigate (i) the impact of cellular conditions that induce ribosome stalling on RNA decay
intermediates; (ii) the conservation of ribothrypsis in other eukaryotes; (iii) the identity of ribothrypsin; and (iv)
the role of RNA modifications in triggering ribothrypsis. These goals are mirrored by our long-term objective to
understand the mechanisms that underlie RNA decay dysregulation in human diseases. The molecular insights
gained in this proposal could also broaden our understanding of ribosome biology and RNA modifications."

Hepatic stellate cell plasticity and maladaptive fibrogenic memory in chronic liver disease
Fibrosis associated with chronic liver disease affects hundreds of millions of patients worldwide. Hepatic stellate
cells (HSCs), in turn, represent the main cellular driver of hepatic fibrosis. A key unanswered question is why
HSCs activate to facilitate tissue repair in response to acute liver injury but hyperactivate to produce exuberant
extracellular matrix in response to repeated liver injury, leading to fibrosis. Central to this behavior switch is a
mechanism for HSCs to remember previous injury episodes in order to respond differently, i.e. hyperactivate,
when exposed to re-injury. Recent studies, including ours (Wang et al. Dev Cell 2019), strongly support the
epigenome and in particular DNA methylation patterns as the carrier of cell memory in development and in tissue
injury. The objective of this research is to clarify how the epigenome and specifically DNA methylation patterns
encode this maladaptive cell memory and amplify HSC’s fibrogenic response following re-injury. This proposal
builds upon recent advances in single cell technology and low-input chromatin profiling which we optimized
extensively to measure HSC gene expression and epigenomic changes in vivo in a novel mouse model of
fibrogenic memory. In our fibrogenic memory model, HSCs completely deactivate following fibrosis regression,
with their transcriptome indistinguishable from uninjured HSCs, however epigenomic changes persist in the form
of chromatin accessibility changes. In response to re-injury, HSCs from regressed liver hyperactivate and are
driven by unique transcriptional networks (WT1, TEAD1, TBX20, and PBX1) not found in HSCs undergoing initial
injury. Using the Uhrf1 floxed mice generated previously in our Dev Cell paper to specifically remove Uhrf1, a
critical component of the DNA methylation machinery, in HSCs, we found that these mice display augmented
fibrogenic memory in response to re-injury. Our central hypothesis is that memory of previous injury through
epigenetic changes modify HSC plasticity and amplify their activation in response to re-injury. We will address
this hypothesis in three interrelated, but distinct specific aims:1) Define the regulatory elements controlling
fibrogenic memory in HSCs; 2) Determine how UHRF1 and the DNA methylome control fibrogenic memory in
HSCs; 3) Uncover novel regulatory nodes driving HSC’s maladaptive response in re-injury. This innovative
approach leveraging cutting-edge genomics technology and unique animal models is significant because it will
yield fundamental new insights into stellate cell biology by uncovering the epigenetic basis of fibrogenic memory,
the contribution of specific genes and transcriptional networks to fibrogenic memory and hepatic fibrosis, and
conserved fibrogenic drivers in liver disease patients that can lead to potential therapeutic targets."

With additional skills in claims data, subject matter expertise, and causal inference methods, I plan to build a
career focused on generating evidence to improve maternal and child health outcomes and reduce disparities
in the United States. Career Development: I will pursue the following training aims during the mentored (K99)
phase of the award: (1) clinical maternal and infant health content expertise; (2) claims data analysis skills; (3)
advanced causal methods, and; (4) professional development. Research Project: Extending postpartum
Medicaid has the potential to address poor maternal health in the United States, with additional implications for
infant care use and health.1 Approximately 63% of maternal deaths in the U.S. occur postpartum, and more
than half are considered to be preventable.2 However, despite high postpartum healthcare needs, pregnancy-
related Medicaid ends after 60 days postpartum. Medicaid pays for almost half of all births in the US and
disproportionately covers births to the low-income population and people of color.3–5 There has recently been
increased interest in postpartum Medicaid, including an American Rescue Plan (ARP) option to extend
Medicaid one-year postpartum.6 Prior to this, the March 2020 Families First Coronavirus Response Act
(FFCRA) prevented Medicaid disenrollment during the pandemic, thereby extending postpartum Medicaid
eligibility, which can inform current postpartum Medicaid policies under consideration. Using the Rhode Island
All-Payer claims data, this proposal's Specific Aims are: K99/1) To evaluate the effects of the FFCRA on
coverage and maternal and infant care in the postpartum period, R00/2) To evaluate the heterogeneous effects
of the FFCRA on outcomes by race and ethnicity, R00/3) To evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected

10845284,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Once conceived, a woman’s cardiovascular system undergoes dramatic structural and functional changes to
accommodate the increasing demands of the fast growing fetus, resulting in profound uterine artery dilation
exemplified by dramatic rise in uterine blood flow (UBF). UBF is a rate-limiting factor for pregnancy health
because an insufficient rise in UBF during pregnancy is causative for intrauterine growth restriction and
preeclampsia (PE) characterized by systemic endothelial damage and vascular dysfunction. Since 1900’s,
numerous studies have concluded that local endothelial nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasodilation is the major
mechanism controlling rise in UBF. However, blockade of local NO production only partially inhibits baseline
pregnancy-associated rise in UBF, suggesting that other mediator(s) are involved. Endogenous hydrogen
sulfide (H2S), mainly synthesized from L-cysteine by two key enzymes: cystathionine -synthase (CBS) and
cystathionine -lyase (CSE), is an extremely potent proangiogenic vasodilator. We initially posited that local
CBS/H2S production can fill the mechanism behind NO to mediate UA vasodilation during pregnancy. Indeed,
we reported that pregnancy dramatically augments UA H2S biosynthesis by selectively upregulating EC and
SM CBS but not CSE expression in animals (rats and ewes) and women in vivo and that H2S stimulates
pregnancy-dependent dilation of pressurized UA ex vivo. In animal models of PE and women with PE, we
found that pregnancy-augmented myometrial UA CBS/H2S is significantly downregulated. However, research
on H2S in uterine hemodynamics is still in its infancy; many important key questions need to be answered
before a physiological and a pathophysiological role of CBS/H2S signaling in normal pregnancy and PE can
be determined. In this new RO1 we propose to test a novel hypothesis that enhanced UA EC and SM
CBS/H2S production mediates pregnancy-associated UA dilation by interacting with vascular
endothelial growth factor and EC eNOS-NO and downregulated UA CBS/H2S signaling contributes to
the vascular dysfunction in PE. We will test this hypothesis by a multidisciplinary translational approach
with biochemical, cellular, molecular, physiological, and pharmacological methods coupled with rat models in
vivo, freshly isolated human and rat UA rings ex vivo, novel human UA EC (hUAEC) and smooth muscle cell
(hUASMC) models in vitro, and myometrial UAs from normotensive vs. PE pregnant women. We have an
outstanding team with a track record of long-term productive collaborative research in the field and unique
tools needed to complete this exciting and important project. We believe that the novel studies outlined in
this RO1 will provide new data to fill a knowledge gap on the physiological and pathophysiological role for
H2S in in uterine hemodynamic regulation and this knowledge will provide a compelling rationale for clinical
trials to explore the therapeutic potential of H2S in women in high risk of PE."
10804666,"Background: During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Veterans have deferred inpatient
care such as coronary revascularization in the context of an acute myocardial infarction. Simultaneously,
cardiovascular care has been disrupted, with clinicians less likely to prescribe guideline indicated medications
for common cardiovascular conditions such as stable coronary artery disease or heart failure. Excess deaths
have also occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among vulnerable populations, raising the
possibility of suboptimal healthcare utilization or quality of care among those not directly infected by the virus.
However, the extent to which cardiovascular healthcare utilization and quality of care have decreased during
the pandemic compared with preceding time periods and whether these changes have impacted Veterans’ risk
of mortality is unknown.
Significance: Cardiovascular disease is the most common condition in the United States and the leading
cause of excess, non-COVID deaths during the early pandemic. The proposed work may identify gaps in VA
healthcare utilization and quality of care with the potential to directly inform national improvements in
cardiovascular care for Veterans, leading to more accessible, higher-quality, more equitable care in the future.
In addition, the evaluation of care for cardiovascular disease could serve as a model for future research in
other disciplines within Veterans Affairs medical specialty care.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Compare inpatient and outpatient utilization (clinic visits / hospitalizations / diagnostic
testing / procedural care) among Veterans with common cardiovascular diagnoses (atrial fibrillation / coronary
artery disease / heart failure) during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with expected utilization based on the
corresponding 3-year period preceding the pandemic.
Aim 2: Compare quality of care (guideline indicated medication / transitions of care) among Veterans with
common cardiovascular diagnoses (atrial fibrillation / coronary artery disease / heart failure) during the COVID-
19 pandemic with that expected based on the corresponding 3-year period preceding the pandemic.
Aim 3: Evaluate whether potential pandemic-related changes in healthcare utilization and/or process of care
quality metrics are associated with an increased risk for the clinical outcomes of all-cause mortality and/or
cardiovascular mortality among Veterans with common cardiovascular diagnoses.
Methodology: We propose an observational, retrospective, national cohort study of Veterans with
cardiovascular disease. The primary data sources will consist of the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)
and the Non-VA Care Program Integrity Tools (PIT) system. Using indirect standardization, we will compare
potential decreases in cardiovascular healthcare utilization and quality of care and a potential increase in
mortality to that which occurred prior to the pandemic, performing subgroup analyses focused on age, sex and
gender, and race and ethnicity as allowed by sample sizes. In mediation analyses, we will then assess
whether the changes in utilization and quality of care were associated with an increased risk of mortality.
Next Steps/Implementation: A stakeholder advisory panel, led by VA operational leaders, investigators, and
Veterans, will be convened to develop comprehensive recommendations to optimize the access, quality, and
equity of VA cardiovascular care and guide VA policies in the late-COVID-19 and/or post-COVID-19 pandemic
period."
10837120,"Abstract
A major challenge in the field of genomic precision medicine is the observation that genotype does not always
predict phenotype in Mendelian disorders. This phenotype variation is thought to be caused in part by common
variants and variants with subtle effects, but the potential deterministic roles of such modifier alleles have not
been rigorously or systematically studied in clinical settings. Toward the long-term goal of deciphering the
genetic basis of incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in human monogenic diseases, this proposal
aims to study patients with recurrent genomic disorders in whom identical genomic rearrangements manifest
disease phenotypes in an incompletely penetrant manner. The overall objective of this proposed project is to
formulate a generalizable approach using cohorts of patients with recurrent large genomic deletions that can
identify and characterize clinically significant disease-modifying variants. The central hypothesis is that patients
with recurrent large genomic deletions offer an effective genomic background to identify disease-modifying
alleles that serve as reliable predictors of disease outcome in individual patients. This central hypothesis will be
tested by defining the genetic determinants of specific phenotype presentations at two genomic loci: early
onset diabetes at 17q12 and abnormal head size at 1q21.1. Large-scale patient resources will be gathered
based on molecular information made available by clinical diagnostics. Recruited patients will be analyzed at
the molecular level by whole genome sequencing. Phenotype–genotype correlation analysis will be performed
to identify candidate modifier alleles under different disease-modifying models based on preliminary data from
each disease locus. Functional validation of selected disease-modifying alleles will be performed using patient-
derived induced pluripotent stem cells. The innovation of this study lies in the assembly of rare personal
genomes with identical copy number variants from clinical diagnostic databases to enable a human subject
“enhancer screen.” The proposed research is significant because it is expected to identify clinically important
alleles in recurrent deletion loci whose presence or absence can be used for precise diagnosis, counseling and
management for patients with genetic disorders. The research strategy utilized herein could be generalized to
other phenotypes or genomic loci, and the general mechanisms discovered will be directly applicable to
understanding incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in human diseases."
10833669,"Project Summary
AAV is a popular gene therapy vector because it has large tissue tropism and low toxicity. However, AAV is
inefficient at packaging its genome, and this leaves many empty or partially full capsids that need to be
removed in manufacturing. Empty capsids can increase the immunogenicity and toxicity of the AAV, especially
when high doses are required. This project will take a structural biology approach to understand how the
presence of the genome in AAV affects the capsid quaternary structure and the resulting effects on capsid
surface chemistry and structural integrity. This will provide better methods to remove empty capsids or reduce
the production of empty capsids, thus providing a safer AAV product for patients. Molecular changes induced
by AAV genome packaging will be determined and integrated with changes in viral conformational dynamics
and physicochemical properties. This novel integration of single particle force measurements using an atomic
force microscopy (AFM) with surface residue charge distributions from amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange
(HDXMS) and native mass spectrometry (MS) will lead to insight into genome interaction with AAV capsids and
how the presence of the genome changes the capsid structure, chemistry, and integrity. An unprecedented
view into how the structure of a viral capsid reacts to different manufacturing conditions and cellular trafficking
conditions that occur during AAV production will be developed by completing the following aims:
Aim 1: Ascertain the difference in the charge and hydrophobicity of AAV capsids. AAV2 and AAV8 will be used
as model systems with three different genome sizes. Chemical force microscopy (CFM) a specialized AFM
technique, will measure the changes in charge and hydrophobicity of AAV capsids under relevant
manufacturing and cellular trafficking conditions.
Aim 2: Identify the contributions of capsid protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions on AAV viral particle
dynamics. Comparison of empty, partially full, and full AAV will reveal contributions of DNA on intrinsic
dynamics using HDXMS and native MS. Further, these measurements will also map interaction interfaces of
AAV capsid with encapsulated DNA in full and partially full AAV.
Aim 3: Determine the physical rigidity and brittleness difference between AAV capsids. Nanoindentation, an
AFM technique, will be used to determine the effects of DNA on AAV capsid strength.
Upon completion of this work, a data driven hypothesis on how AAV interacts with its genome and how the
capsid structure changes with different genome sizes will be developed. The effect of solution conditions,
which vary greatly during the virus life cycle and manufacturing cycle, will be elucidated. Descriptions of DNA
packaging in AAV and the structural changes that occur due to DNA packaging will be completed. This
information will improve production, quality control, and safety of AAV and bring more lifesaving AAV therapies
to market."
10875634,"Germinal center (GC) response generates memory B cells (MBC) and long-lived plasma cells (PC), which are
critical in our immune responses to pathogen infection and vaccination. Uncontrolled GC response may result in
the development of harmful antibodies that cause autoimmunity or allergic diseases. There is a critical need to
therapeutically manipulate GC response to improve vaccine efficacy as well as to effectively treat diseases
caused by pathogenic B cell memory formation. A barrier to achieving this is a lack of understanding of
mechanisms regulating GC B cell (GCBC) fate decision post positive selection. Most importantly, the signaling
that can guide GC B cells to differentiate into memory compartments instead of recycling within GC is still poorly
understood. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein expression is highly elevated in GCBC, resulting
in a unique AKT signaling network. PTEN deficiency compromises B cell tolerance and impairs class-switching
recombination in the GC. However, little is known about the role of PTEN signaling in GCBC fate decision. We
have generated intriguing preliminary data showing that knocking down PTEN in established GCBC enhanced
their differentiation toward PC. The objective of this proposal is to further elucidate the molecular regulation of
GCBC fate decision controlled by PTEN signaling. Our overall hypothesis is that GCBC fate decision is regulated
by PTEN signaling strength, and strong T helper signals down-regulate PTEN signaling in GCBC to promote
their differentiation into the memory compartments. This hypothesis will be tested via two aims: 1) Elucidate the
mechanisms of how PTEN signaling controls GCBC fate decision. We hypothesize that PTEN haploinsufficiency
in GCBC will favor MBC differentiation while full deletion of PTEN will favor PC differentiation. 2) Identify the
signaling pathways regulating PTEN in GCBC. Our hypothesis is that strong T helper signals can downregulated
PTEN in GCBC through sustained c-Myc expression. Upon completion of these studies, we expect to generate
key knowledge regarding both the function and regulation of PTEN signaling in GCBC fate decision. The
mechanistic insights achieved from these studies may open new avenues to control GC response through
manipulating PTEN signaling network, which has the potential to improve vaccine efficacy and to develop novel
treatments for diseases related to pathogenic GC response.

10805474,"Abstract
Craniofacial development is a complex process requiring coordinated proliferation, morphogenesis, fusion and
differentiation of distinct facial prominences. The complexity of this process leaves it vulnerable to genetic and
environmental perturbations, such that craniofacial malformations are a common human birth defect. Thus,
about 75% of birth defects involve the head, face, and oral tissues - with orofacial clefting affecting ~1 in 700
live births. Orofacial defects such as CL/P (cleft lip with or without cleft palate) can impart a significant
decrease in quality of life on those afflicted and present a major economic burden associated with treatment.
The underlying genetic and developmental processes of embryonic facial development are strikingly similar in
human and mouse, making the mouse one of the best available model systems to study human pathology.
Despite this similarity, there are unfortunately very few cases in which the same gene mutation in mouse and
human are known to cause CL/P. One notable exception is TFAP2A, the gene encoding transcription factor
AP-2, which causes CL/P when mutated in mouse and is also linked to both human syndromic and non-
syndromic CL/P. Notably, TFAP2A is mutated in human Branchio-Oculo-Facial Syndrome (BOFS) a
monogenetic condition that presents with orofacial clefting, branchial skin anomalies, and eye defects.
Previous clinical studies have indicated that missense mutations in TFAP2A generally cause more severe
phenotypes than heterozygosity. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown that such missense mutations have a
dominant negative mechanism of action - inhibiting DNA binding of a wild-type protein partner in the functional
dimer. To study the etiology of human BOFS, we recently constructed a BOFS mouse model by conditionally
placing a human missense mutation into the mouse Tfap2a locus. This humanized BOFS model recapitulates
the craniofacial phenotypes observed in human patients including CL/P and branchial defects. This proposal
will use this new model to test the hypothesis that CL/P caused by dominant negative BOFS mutations can be
reversed by in utero treatment that alters the ratio between mutant and wild-type protein. In Aim 1 viral vectors
will be used to add supplementary wild-type AP-2 early in development to titrate out the mutant protein. This
approach will also be tested in related Tfap2a CL/P models in which there is insufficient AP-2 available. Aim
2 will employ anti-sense oligonucleotides to target and preferentially knockdown the mutant message in the
BOFS mice. Finally, in Aim 3 a gene editing approach will be used to target the mutant BOFS allele. The
expected outcome of the proposed research is a deeper understanding of delivery systems and therapeutic
approaches for in utero treatments, and this should have a broad impact on how we approach human
congenital dental and craniofacial disorders caused by dominant negative or loss of function mutations. Our
Aims are aligned to the NIDCR RFA entitled “In utero Treatments of Congenital Dental and Craniofacial
Disorders Using Precision Medicine Approaches” (RFA-DE-23-004) for which this application is targeted."

 The a priori prediction and design of efficient mutant enzymes are broadly recognized as a “Holy Grail”
in chemistry and biology because it will allow researchers to find effective enzyme variants to degrade environ-
mental pollutants, conduct late-stage functionalization of fine chemicals, and treat diseases. Directed evolution
has been widely applied to identify optimal enzyme variants for chemical reactions, but how to accelerate the
screening cycles remains a critical roadblock due to the unknown relationship between sequence, structure, and
kinetics for enzyme catalysis. To overcome this challenge, the PI has been developing three computational in-
frastructures: 1) an integrated enzyme structure-function database, IntEnzyDB, that provides clean and tabulated
data for data-driven modeling; 2) a new software module, RosettaQM, for evaluating enzyme-reacting species
interactions using quantum mechanical methods; and 3) a high-throughput workflow, EnzyHTP, that allows com-
putational screening of enzyme variants. Enabled by these tools, in this MIRA proposal, the PI emphasizes
advancing new computational tools to predict and design new enzyme catalysts. First, the PI will develop a
multistate kinetic scoring function to predict the influence of mutation on apparent enzyme kinetics by leveraging
the enzymology data stored in IntEnzyDB and the QM-based enzyme-reacting species interaction scoring in
RosettaQM (Project-1). The PI plans to develop a kinetic scoring function that accounts for contributions of mul-
tiple reactive states along a reaction pathway and is distinct from existing computational rational engineering
strategies that emphasize the stabilization of one hypothetical transition state. The multistate kinetic scoring will
be experimentally validated to predict efficiency-enhancing mutations for FR29 esterase for a proof of concept
and fluoroacetate dehalogenase FAcD for environmental pollutant degradation. Second, the PI will develop an
integrated enzyme predicting protocol that augments molecular simulations and machine-learning models to
design enzyme variants to accommodate non-native substrates for late-stage functionalization of drug-like mol-
ecules (Project-2). EnzyHTP will be further developed to incorporate machine learning models to achieve multi-
objective prediction of beneficial mutations, evaluating the impact of mutations on enzyme electrostatic environ-
ment, substrate positioning, substrate-enzyme interactions, and enzyme stability, solubility, and promiscuity. En-
zyHTP will be experimentally examined in the design of new group-transferases to accommodate S-adenosyl
methionine analogues for late-stage functionalization of everninomicin, a promising drug for treating a broad
spectrum of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. In summary, the proposed research will deliver enabling
computational tools for virtual prediction and design of function-enhancing enzyme variants for biomedical and
biocatalytic uses."
10873847,"The growing medication use in all ages led to the fact that 20% of the US adult population take five or more
drugs (polypharmacy). Over 500 medications commonly prescribed in polypharmacy (e.g., antidepressants,
urinary antispasmodics, and psycholeptics) possess anticholinergic (AC) properties blocking the muscarinic
signaling of neural regulation. Due to the scattered distribution of muscarinic receptors in the body, AC
medications have a wide range of side effects. Besides the most severe central toxicity of cognitive impairment,
dyskinesia, and psychosis, which can lead to delirium, the most frequent peripheral side effect is dry mouth. Dry
mouth is characterized by reduced saliva secretion (hyposalivation), impaired quality of life by causing chewing
or swallowing problems, complaints of oral dryness (xerostomia), speaking difficulties, mucosal changes,
increased rate of dental caries, and tooth loss. Dry mouth causes increased susceptibility to bacterial colonization
and infections in the oral cavity and the upper respiratory tract. However, no data are available on predicting
medication-induced dry mouth severity or determining the AC burden from these medications among dental
patients. There is a significant research gap in identifying high-risk xerostomia patients in the middle-aged
population before reaching older ages when damage to oral health is irreversible. We designed a prospective
cohort study with two aims for addressing these questions. In Aim 1., we will evaluate the correlation between
AC burden and dry mouth outcomes, including the flow rates of the minor salivary glands (SG) in 90 middle-
aged patients (45-64 years). We will determine whether high AC burden, quantified by the AC drug score (ADS)
and serum AC activity (SAA) in blood, is associated with more severe dry mouth symptoms, measured at
baseline and follow-ups for two years. We will assess dry mouth using saliva flow rates (unstimulated whole
saliva and minor SGs) and oral health measures associated with dry mouth, including xerostomia, dental caries,
and oral health impact profile. In this aim, we will examine the feasibility of minor SG flow screening as a point-
of-care test for dry mouth. In Aim 2., we will explore whether CYP450 genetic polymorphisms predict dry mouth
severity. Recent studies reported an increased prevalence of AC side effects in patients with inactive genetic
variants of liver cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for the metabolic clearance of AC drugs. We will analyze
DNA from patients’ blood for the genetic variations of CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 enzymes and compare oral health
outcomes associated with dry mouth between poor and normo-metabolizing phenotypes. We propose to study
whether dry-mouth pharmacogenetics provides evidence for inter-individual variability in oral health outcomes to
identify patients with predictable severity of AC medication-induced dry mouth. The overarching goal of our
explorative study is to establish clinically relevant associations between AC burden and oral health outcomes,
which can support future investigations of potential causal relationships and risk calculations for dry mouth
development."
10879129,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD)'s neuropathologic hallmarks are the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau
proteins. Thus far, therapeutic efforts have been mainly focused on Aβ and showed limited success, underscoring
the need for alternative approaches of intervention, particularly those that can target mechanisms related to the
initial propagation of pathology. The locus coeruleus (LC) has been identified as one of the earliest regions
affected by tau: by the age of 40, 80% of individuals exhibit tau aggregation in the LC, and by the age of 50, 50%
of individuals exhibit tau aggregation in the entorhinal cortex (EC), suggesting tau progression from the LC to
the medial temporal lobe (MTL). However, the mechanism of tau propagation is yet unknown. Accumulated
evidence from animal research suggests that pathologic tau propagates via axons and cell-to-cell transmission
and that synaptic and neuronal activity levels facilitate this process. Furthermore, a recent study using a rat
model of pretangle tau in LC neurons and optogenetic stimulation suggested that novelty-like phasic LC
activation protects against the deleterious changes linked to pretangle tau. In contrast, stress-associated tonic
LC activation worsens LC neuronal health and promotes depressive behaviors that have been associated with tau
accumulation in the EC. Our own preliminary data shows that lower novelty-related LC activation is related to
higher tau deposition in the EC and steeper memory decline in cognitively healthy older individuals. This
evidence forms the scientific premise for the hypothesis that phasic versus tonic resting-state LC activity may be
associated with mechanisms of tau propagation and ultimately predict cognitive decline. The goal of this proposal
is to examine the relationship between the balance between phasic versus tonic LC activity detected in resting-
state fMRI data and tau deposition in the EC and the MTL across all stages of the AD continuum and cognitive
decline. To achieve this, we will resolve two methodological barriers: (ii) accounting for the hemodynamic
blurring in resting-state fMRI using deconvolution in terms of an optimally defined region- and subject-specific
hemodynamic response function, and (ii) using novel event-detection techniques for the detection of periods of
phasic and tonic activity in the deconvoluted LC. Our methodology for quantifying the balance between phasic
versus tonic LC activity will be fine-tuned and validated using simultaneous LC BOLD-fMRI, fiber photometry
calcium imaging, and pupil dilation data collected from awake rodents during resting-experimental conditions.
Combining these state-of-the-art novel methods with tau-, Aβ-PET, and longitudinal cognitive data from the
Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, will allow us to examine the
following aims: Aim 1) To investigate the associations between cross-sectional patterns of LC activity with age,
sex, tau, and beta-amyloid pathology among individuals of varying biomarker levels, Aim 2) To relate LC
activation patterns to cognitive decline as a function of AD pathology. Together, these aims contribute to our
understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of initial tau propagation and its relevance for cognition."

Signal transduction pathways underlie the very basis of life and are often critical targets for disease therapeutics.
Yet, precise understanding of the intracellular dynamics, kinetics, and stoichiometry of how signals are
transmitted – knowledge that is critical to capturing a holistic and more accurate view of signaling processes –
has not been attainable for many pathways due to technological barriers to observing signaling events in real
time in cells. Recent advances in technology, including proximity labeling approaches and light sheet
microscopy, are finally now presenting solutions to knit together our fragmented view of signaling in vivo. Building
on the expertise of the Blacklow laboratory in Notch signaling mechanism with the expertise of the Kirchhausen
laboratory in advanced microscopy, we propose to use the Notch signaling system as a model to define precisely
the series of events required for Notch signal activation in normal and pathogenic states, and in so doing, develop
approaches and computational visualization tools that can be broadly applied to other pathways and systems.
Notch signaling is an ideal model signaling system for this work because it exerts a critical influence on cell
differentiation in all metazoans and its misregulation is associated with diverse diseases, including the
pathogenesis of many human cancers. Moreover, fundamental facets of this signaling mechanism, including the
dynamics of ligand and receptor molecules, the stoichiometry of ligand-receptor complexes at sites of activation,
the timing and location of activating Notch proteolysis, and the path of Notch from plasma membrane to nucleus,
remain incompletely understood. Here, we will address these gaps in knowledge by using APEX proximity
labeling coupled with quantitative mass spectrometry to elucidate the pathway for passage of the Notch
intracellular domain from plasma membrane to nucleus, and by implementing lattice light sheet microscopy to
visualize the molecular events of Notch signal transduction. In preliminary work, we have used CRISPR/Cas9
genomic labeling in SVG-A immortalized astrocytes to create a Notch-APEX2 fusion protein for proximity
labeling, and our preliminary analysis of a pilot experiment reveals dynamic changes in the labeling of proteins
in different cellular compartments as a function of time, confirming the feasibility of this approach. We have also
engineered fluorescently labeled receptor and ligand knockin proteins for LLSM. Now we will use this approach
to quantify the number of receptor and ligand molecules that come together at the site of cell-cell contact as a
function of time, and determine how many copies of each must be present to induce receptor cleavage and
activate target gene expression. Successful completion of these aims will provide unprecedented resolution, in
both space and time, of the fundamental events required for physiologic Notch signal transduction in living cells.
We expect to not only answer long-standing questions about the molecular events involved in activation of Notch
signals but to also open up a whole new realm of biology to mechanistic analysis."
10902004,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of this Focused Technology R&D proposal is to develop and apply modular and generalizable
engineering approaches to generate smart antibody-like protein scaffolds (APSs) equipped with precision
switches, which can be controlled by light or drugs to confer remote control over endogenous proteins and
cellular physiology in multiple biological systems. Over the past decade, a variety of chemogenetic and
optogenetic tools have been designed to visualize, delocalize, modify, and degrade proteins of interest (POIs).
These engineering efforts, nonetheless, often require extensive prior knowledge on the targeted POIs. To
regulate endogenous POIs in living cells or organisms, one has to tag POIs with light- or chemical-sensitive
modules via genetic knock-in or genome engineering, thereby making the process rather time- and resource-
consuming. Furthermore, some of the existing chemo/optogenetic tools still suffer from relatively slow
activation kinetics, partial irreversibility, limited choices of chemoswitches , and narrow dynamic ranges of cue-
induced changes. To address these challenges, the transdisciplinary team proposes to engineer modular
precision switches into single-domain antibody-like protein scaffolds, rather than the endogenous target itself,
to confer tight control over POIs and the associated biological activities or pathways. Specially, the team will
combine seven selected APSs templates (including nanobody, monobody and affibody) with innovative
optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to develop new generations of light- or chemical-controllable APSs
(named as LiAPSs and ChiAPSs, respectively). The prioritized choices of switches include: (i) photons
emitting in the blue, far-red, and near infrared (NIR) range (400-800 nm) to diversify the existing repertoire of
LiAPSs and significantly improve their kinetic and dynamic properties (Specific Aim 1); (ii) FDA-approved drugs
(antivirals) and beverages (caffeine and its metabolites) that promise to reduce barriers for translational
applications (Specific Aim 2). These switchable APSs will allow the team to remotely control antibody-antigen
recognition and to manipulate endogenous targets in a reversible manner at high temporal and/or spatial
resolution. In parallel, the team will demonstrate the applications of engineered smart APSs for acute and
precise initiation and termination of biological processes in cellulo, as well as remote in vivo immuno- or
neuromodulation in both rodent and Drosophila models of human diseases. Compelling preliminary data have
been provided to demonstrate the high feasibility of the proposed new approaches, as well as the team’s
mastery of the repertoire of methods, assays, and models described in the application. The innovative
molecular toolkit to be generated from the project will offer a wide choices of precision switches to enable
many future biological questions and impose a high and sustainable impact to the biomedical field."

Candidate: Carolyn Foster, MD, MSHS is a pediatrician and junior clinical investigator focused on improving
the evidence-based for the care of children with chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity who require
invasive home mechanical ventilation (HMV). Dr. Foster’s long-term career goal is to become an independent
physician-investigator who works in cross-disciplinary teams to design and evaluate evidence-based health
care delivery interventions for children with medical technology dependence who require in-home services.
Research Context/Objective: Children with CLD of prematurity are a growing, costly group of patients with
high health care resource use and significant family caregiver burden. No empirically based parameters exist
to guide how this population is discontinued from invasive HMV, leading to lack of appropriate, timely
discontinuation of HMV. Therefore, the objective of this award is for Dr. Foster to learn how to assess the
multifaceted factors that contribute to HMV duration, and to pilot test the integration of these factors into clinical
management of children with CLD of prematurity, to safely shorten duration of HMV use.
Specific Aims: 1) Determine which patient level factors are associated with HMV duration; 2) Determine which
family caregiver and health service factors are associated with weaning of HMV support; 3) Develop and pilot
the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of integrating patient, family, and health service data elements into a
clinical management dashboard design to optimize HMV use in children with CLD of prematurity.
Research Plan: Dr. Foster will retrospectively analyze existing patients’ clinical data to evaluate the
association of patient medical factors (e.g., ventilator settings, oxygen use, weight, end-tidal CO2,) with HMV
duration (Aim 1); prospectively collect patient reported outcome (PRO) measures (i.e., validated surveys) to
elucidate which caregiver and system factors are associated with weaning of HMV support among current
HMV patients (Aim 2); and use a stakeholder-engaged Learning Health System approach to develop and pilot
the feasibility, acceptability, and usability (implementation) of a clinical HMV dashboard (Aim 3).
Career Development Plan/Environment: Through a combination of local and national didactic activities,
experiential learning, workshops, seminars, and professional activities, Dr. Foster will acquire expertise in
evaluating longitudinal health outcomes and health care utilization; patient-reported outcome (PRO) health
measurement science; and intervention design and pilot testing. Dr. Foster will strengthen her professional
skills needed for an independent physician-investigator career through close mentorship by an experienced,
complementary team of NIH-funded team mentors, advisors, and collaborators. Northwestern University and
Lurie Children’s Hospital will provide outstanding research infrastructures to enable a successful award and
are strongly committed to Dr. Foster’s transition to research independence."

Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating glia cells of the central nervous system allowing coordinated conduction
of action potentials among neurons, thus imperative for proper neurological functions. The vast majority of our
knowledge in oligodendrocytes is derived from rodent models. Perhaps for that reason, clinical translation of our
knowledge has been limited, leaving many disorders without treatment. In order to understand the fundamental
human oligodendrocyte development, pathology, and ultimately to discover drug candidates with higher
confidence, therefore, it is necessary to develop protocols in human-based platform. Single-cell RNA sequencing
comparing mouse and human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) revealed a compelling unique sub-
population in human OPCs that does not seem to exist in mouse OPCs. More importantly, gene ontology analysis
of this sub-population identified highly expressed signature genes associated with synaptic development,
organization, and transmission, suggesting neuron-oligodendrocyte communication during neuronal
development. To our knowledge, there are no reports suggested a direct synaptic control by OPCs. Based on
these observations, we hypothesize that a sub-population of human OPCs regulates synaptic development. This
proposal intends to establish concrete evidence for human-specific OPC sub-population through two pilot
experiments to prepare for a future external funding focusing on understanding the molecular mechanisms of
human synaptic development controlled by OPCs. First, to define temporal and spatial interaction between
human specific OPC sub-population and neurons, we will generate spatial transcriptomic profiling of developing
human brain spanning gestational week 10 to 24, when dynamic synaptic development as well as OPC
maturation occur. Spatial transcriptomics uses an intact tissue section mounted on a slide that is coated with
arrays of barcoded RT primers to create spatially barcoded cDNA, allowing us to obtain transcriptomic data from
the entire tissue retaining spatial information. These data will reveal where the OPC sub-population exists in
developing brains and what type(s) of neighboring neurons they are interacting with. Second, we will begin to
test the function of human specific OPC sub-population using quantitative electrophysiology in a co-culture and
slice culture formats that we have optimized. Once achieved, these studies will lay the foundation to study a
novel function of human OPC sub-population. Generated transcriptomic datasets will allow us to formulate
testable hypotheses for future external grants. In a larger perspective, discovery of a new mechanism in synaptic
control may lead to a re-formulation of the pathomechanisms in diseases with suspected involvement of
oligodendrocytes, such as intellectual disabilities and neuropsychiatric disorders."
10928803,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The opioid epidemic has encouraged the biomedical research community to explore new pain
targets and further study opioid’s most famous target, the mu opioid receptor. One underexplored
arena is the study of the endogenous opioid peptide system, which we know very little especially
in comparison to our knowledge of the receptors they activate. This is despite the commonsense
understanding that the endogenous peptides must change as a result of the allostatic load
imposed by chronic pain, opioids, and chronic opioid exposure. There are well established sex
differences in the actions of opioids at the mu opioid receptor, but it is unknown whether there are
also differences in the endogenous opioid peptides. The experiments outlined here lay the
necessary and long overdue groundwork to understand the neural mechanisms of one class of
the endogenous opioids, called enkephalins, and how they contribute to pain. In the first aim, we
will quantify enkephalin mRNA expression in regions of the brain known to play a role in top-down
pain modulation. Next, we will use a viral retrograde tracer to map the enkephalin containing
neurons that synapse in the PAG, something that has never been done before. In Aim 2 we will
probe the behavioral effects of activating enkephalin containing neurons that synapse in the PAG
using excitatory and inhibitory chemogenetic approaches followed by assessment on pain assays.
We expect that increasing activation of all enkephalin neurons that synapse in the PAG will result
in increased antinociception. Further, we expect that inhibition will lower the endogenous opioid
release and therefore produce pain. We will further isolate certain neural projections from one
brain region at a time to elucidate which brain regions are driving the enkephalin mediated
antinociceptive responses. This research will allow us to better understand how the endogenous
opioid system facilitates pain control and whether there are underlying differences that lead to
differences in pain modulation in males and females."
10804693,"PROJECT SUMMARY. A dysregulated intestinal immune response is a hallmark of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), but current therapies that target these responses often exhibit poor long-term efficacy. The
reasons for this poor efficacy likely stem from an incomplete understanding of the immunological and microbial
interactions that lead to disease. Recent studies examining immune interactions in human IBD patients have
highlighted dysregulated interactions between immunoregulatory and inflammatory T cells as a key feature of
disease. However, the exact cellular players involved and how these dysregulated interactions occur remain
unclear. In efforts to close these gaps in knowledge, our long-term goals are to define the mechanisms that
govern the interactions between immunoregulatory and inflammatory T cells and how these interactions can be
targeted to improve IBD therapeutics.
 In our preliminary data, we show that mice carrying conventional T cell (i.e. αβ T cell receptor+)-specific
deletions of STAT3 and BATF develop an aggressive spontaneous colitis that closely resembles intestinal
inflammation that is characteristic of human IBD. Intriguingly, the known mediators and suppressors of disease
(IL-17-producing Th17 and Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells), are equivalent in STAT3/BATF-double deficient
mice and disease-free STAT3 and BATF-single deficient mice. These data suggest that a STAT3/BATF-
regulated transcriptional program induces Th17/Treg-independent immunoregulatory function that is critical for
maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Intestinal disease in conventional T cell STAT3/BATF-deficient mice was
marked by the rapid accumulation of microbiota-dependent inflammatory γδ T cells, resembling those found in
lesional colonic tissues of IBD patients. These data suggest that STAT3/BATF-expressing conventional T cells
interact with the microbiota and γδ T cells to suppress disease. The objective of this study is to determine how
STAT3 and BATF regulate the interactions and functions of conventional immunoregulatory T cells and to
define how microbiota-dependent γδ T cells contribute to disease. Here we hypothesize that conventional T cell
STAT3 and BATF cooperatively regulate a gene network that influences interactions with the microbiota and
pathogenic γδ T cell responses in IBD. We will test this hypothesis via two aims in which we will 1) define the
STAT3/BATF-regulated transcriptional network that governs conventional-γδ T cell interactions in IBD and 2)
determine the role the microbiota-induced γδ T cells in driving IBD. The results of this work will be highly
significant and innovative as we have identified a novel mechanism by which conventional T cells maintain
intestinal homeostasis and developed a new murine model to examine interactions of these cells with the
microbiota and γδ T cells in disease. Further, our studies will provide insight into new therapies that may act to
bolster STAT3/BATF+ conventional T cells to prevent the onset of IBD."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among American men and metastatic Castration-
Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) is the mostly deadly form of PCa. mCRPC is currently treated with AR
targeted therapy, however resistance to the current therapies for mCRPC is unfortunately inevitable,
underscoring the critical demand for elucidating the mechanisms of resistance and identifying actionable
therapeutic targets to overcome resistance. We have identified the loss of Synaptotagmin Binding Cytoplasmic
RNA Interacting Protein (SYNCRIP) as a top candidate conferring therapy resistance through a in vivo library
screening examining genomic alterations which confer resistance. We discovered that the frequent deletion of
SYNCRIP, occurring in approximately 14% of patients, is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes of
mCRPC patients receiving AR targeted therapy. Our data has demonstrated that depletion of SYNCRIP
promotes resistance to AR targeted therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found significantly
upregulated APOBEC-mediated DNA mutation patterns in both PCa cell lines and mCRPC patients with
SYNCRIP depletion. The DNA deaminase APOBEC1, presumably sequestered by SYNCRIP, is required and
sufficient for the AR targeted therapy resistance observed in SYNCRIP-depleted tumor cells. Thus, the overall
objectives of this application are to define the molecular role of SYNCRIP in PCa tumorigenesis and AR targeted
therapy resistance, and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which the loss of this protein promotes
tumorigenesis and resistance, using human PCa cells, organoids, and mouse models. We proposed to elucidate
the role of this putative tumor suppressor gene by testing the following central hypothesis: Loss of SYNCRIP
confers resistance to AR targeted therapy through the ectopic APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis of key
oncogenes and the activation of downstream signaling pathways. We will examine this hypothesis by
pursuing three specific aims: In Aim 1, we will define whether SYNCRIP depletion promotes PCa tumorigenesis,
including both primary PCa and mCRPC, and AR targeted therapy resistance using multiple human PCa cell
lines, organoids, and xenograft models. We will also examine whether SYNCRIP depletion adjusts AR
dependency and lineage plasticity. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the role of APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis in
mediating AR targeted therapy resistance in cells with SYNCRIP depletion, and identify the mutated resistant
driver genes. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of SYNCRIP in the initiation, progression, and response to AR
targeted therapy of primary PCa using various mouse models. These proposed aims will capitalize on the
expertise of our lab and of our collaborators to comprehensively define the role of SYNCRIP in PCa
tumorigenesis and therapy resistance, and to elucidate the molecular mechanism through which the loss of this
tumor suppressor confers resistance. The completion of this study will delineate novel insights into the
mechanism of AR targeted therapy resistance and may identify new actionable therapeutic targets and

Sepsis is a major health issue with a mortality rate of 30%. Sepsis induces huge stress
responses, including a 5-10 fold induction in glucocorticoid (GC) production in adrenal
gland, however, the function of this inducible GC (iGC) remains poorly understood.
Importantly, 25-60% of septic patients suffer relative adrenal insufficiency – insufficient
iGC production in response to stress. Given the potential complications of adrenal
insufficiency, GC therapy is often used for septic shock patients. However, the true
contribution of adrenal insufficiency to sepsis and the efficacy of GC therapy are highly
controversial. While a number of factors contribute to the debate, a lack of a relative
adrenal insufficiency animal model has limited our capacity to address these issues.
Toward a solution, scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI), a well-established high density
lipoprotein (HDL) receptor, was first identified in our laboratory as a critical protective
factor in sepsis. A number of laboratories including ours recently reported that SR-BI
null mice fail to produce iGC in response to ACTH stimulation, establishing SR-BI null
mice as a relative adrenal insufficiency model. Using this unique model, we
demonstrated that mice with relative adrenal insufficiency are susceptible to septic
death, and more importantly, supplementation of GC rescued mice with relative adrenal
insufficiency, but surprisingly, caused more death in mice without relative adrenal
insufficiency. Our findings demonstrate that relative adrenal insufficiency is a risk factor
and an endotype of sepsis. Our findings also provide a “proof of concept” to support a
precision medicine approach to guide the use of GC for sepsis therapy, specifically,
selectively using GC therapy for a subgroup of septic patients with relative adrenal
insufficiency. In this R35/MIRA application, we propose to use our newly developed
adrenal-specific SR-BI null mice as a unique relative adrenal insufficiency animal model
to understand why relative adrenal insufficiency is a risk factor for sepsis and why GC
therapy benefits mice with relative adrenal insufficiency, but harms those without. The
translation of this study will improve the overall efficacy of sepsis therapy and save
lives."
10808075,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease and preferentially occurs in arterial regions exposed to
disturbed blood flow (d-flow) while those in the stable flow (s-flow) regions are protected. The mechanisms by
which d-flow and s-flow regulate atherogenesis are still not well-understood. To address this critical knowledge
gap, we recently conducted a scRNAseq and a scATACseq assay using the mouse partial carotid ligation (PCL)
model of atherosclerosis caused by d-flow. The study revealed that d-flow dramatically alters endothelial
transcriptome and epigenomic profiles, reprogramming them into the inflammatory, mesenchymal (EndMT), and
immune cell-like (EndICLT) phenotypes, which we defined as “endothelial reprogramming (EndRep)”. While the
pro-atherogenic role of inflammation and EndMT is well-established, the mechanisms and role of EndICLT and
EndRep in atherosclerosis are unknown. We identified CEBPb through a reanalysis of our scRNAseq and
scATACseq datasets as a candidate transcription factor that could regulate EndRep. Our preliminary data further
show that the expression of CEBPb increased by d-flow in vivo and cultured HAECs. CEBPb produces three
different protein isoforms, LAP1, LAP2, and LIP, through alternative translation. Surprisingly, CEBPb is
translated primarily as the LIP protein in HAECs. Further, d-flow stimulates the nuclear localization of LIP in
HAECs, and overexpression of LIP dramatically induces EndRep (endothelial inflammation, EndMT, and
EndICLT). Our proteomics study shows that LIP binds the PSMB9 immunoproteasome protein, and d-flow-
increases the PSMB9 activity. Furthermore, prior studies showed that LIP induces cancer-type metabolic
reprogramming. Therefore, we hypothesize that d-flow stimulates nuclear expression of LIP, which binds to
PSMB9, leading to EndRep and atherosclerosis. We will test the hypothesis with three aims. Aim 1 will determine
the effect of d-flow on LIP nuclear expression and its role in EndRep. EC-specific-Confetti mice will be used for
lineage tracing to validate the flow regulation of EndICLT and EndRep. HAECs treated with si-CEBPb or LIP
plasmid and mice with EC-specific LIP overexpression (LIPEC-OE) or LIP deficiency (LIPDEF) will be used. An
ultrasound-guided method will be used to deliver LIP to the left carotid of LIPDEF mice to induce EndRep. Aim 2
will determine how LIP induces EndRep in ECs flow-dependent manner. scRNAseq & scATACseq assays will
be conducted using the LIPEC-OE and LIPDEF mice with the PCL to identify LIP and flow-regulated genes/pathways.
Flow-regulation of PSMB9 activity and its role in LIP-induced EndRep will be determined in HAECs and mice
using siRNAs and PSMB9 inhibitors. Aim 3 will determine the role of LIP in atherosclerosis in a flow- and PSMB9-
dependent manner. Atherosclerosis in LIPEC-OE and LIPDEF will be studied in the acute PCL and chronic model
using AAV-PCSK9 and western diet with or without PSMB9 inhibitor treatment. scRNAseq and scATACseq
analysis will be conducted in these mice. Human coronary staining for CEBPb will determine its
pathophysiological significance. These studies could reveal potential anti-atherogenic therapeutic avenues."
10867499,"Single amino acid variants in TREM2 have been identified by genome-wide association studies to be one of
the strongest genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD-associated variants in TREM2
impair TREM2's ability to bind and signal in response to ligands in the body, further affecting TREM2-mediated
immune activation in AD. Identifying the available drugs as TREM2 ligands and understanding how the drugs
regulate TREM2-mediated immune activation, could reposition the available drugs to target TREM2 and aid
the development of combined drug therapy for AD treatment. The central hypothesis of the proposed study
is that the available drugs, including FDA-approved drugs, could bind TREM2 at either basic and/or
hydrophobic binding site, allosteric effect of drugs at TREM2 either or two binding sites could regulate ligand
binding at both sites to modulate TREM2-mediated immune activation in AD, and compensate for the loss of
TREM2-mediated immune activities by AD-associated TREM2 variants. We will test the hypothesis with three
Aims with integrated computational and experimental approaches. Aim 1 is to identify available drugs bound
basic or/and hydrophobic binding sites on TREM2 with unbiased virtual screening and biophysical and
biological experimental validation. Aim 2 is to characterize the interactions of the available drugs with TREM2
and determine the allosteric effect of available drugs binding at basic and hydrophobic TREM2 binding sites,
and on TREM2-mediated immune activation. Aim 3 is to determine whether the available drugs bound TREM2
could counteract the loss of TREM2-ApoE binding and its mediated immune activities caused by AD-
associated TREM2 variants. New knowledge gained from this study could have high impact for AD
research and treatment by repositioning the available drugs to target TREM2 and further the insight into
available drugs modulating TREM2-mediated immune activation, offering a molecular basis for strategy
development of using available drugs including drug combinations to target TREM2 for AD treatment.
Investigating novel TREM2 functional mechanism in AD at a fundamental level  how TREM2 activation by
available drugs at basic and/or hydrophobic sites and whether and how available drugs compensate for the
loss of TREM2 immune activity by AD-associated variants  is the necessary first step. Innovations of study
include: 1) This will be the first study to identify available drugs as TREM2 ligand by targeting both TREM2
basic and hydrophobic sites in a more conclusive manner with unbiased virtual screening and validation with
biophysical binding and biological cellular function experiments. 2) Results from this study will unveil novel
findings about the allosteric effects of available drugs binding at either TREM2 binding site, on TREM2 binding
AD pathology related ligand in the body including ApoE, and on TREM2-mediated immune activation. 3)
Research outcomes could propose targeting TREM2 with available drugs currently used for other conditions to
compensate for loss of TREM2-mediated immune activities by AD-associated variants for AD treatment."

IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and is the most
frequent cause of kidney failure in Asians, and the leading cause of glomerulonephritis in Caucasian
populations; however, this disease is uncommon in African populations. Kidney biopsies are required for the
diagnosis and are characterized by immunodeposits of IgA1 with C3 (and occasionally IgG and IgM) in the
glomerulus, which in turn damages the kidneys.
We have previously utilized state of the art approaches in genomics, biochemistry, and immunology to
understand IgAN to provide insight into IgAN pathogenesis. In this proposal we will continued to elucidate IgAN
pathogenesis, using genetics, biochemistry, immunology and animal models. We will use an exome-wide
association study to identify rare mutations in IgAN, stratified by IgA1 glycosylation defects. We will generate a
transcriptomic map of IgA-producing B-cells derived from IgAN patients to define the molecular networks in
regulating galactose deficient IgA1. Finally, using Galnt14 knockout mice we will evaluate the role of O-
glycosylation in the homing and trafficking of B-lymphocytes in response to an antigenic challenge.
Our research proposal therefore focuses of IgAN pathogenesis, genetic variants, host factors, biochemical and
immunological analysis and the interactions of these different components. At the conclusion of this project, we
will have identified novel variants using exome-wide association studies, generated a transcriptomic map and
defined networks in regulating galactose-deficient IgA1, and the role of O-glycosylation in the homing and
trafficking of B-lymphocytes, elucidating new mechanisms for IgAN pathogenesis."

The Michigan Vision Clinician-Scientist Development Program is a proven mechanism for growing the number
and effectiveness of clinician-scientists in vision research. It is based on an interdisciplinary approach
leveraging collaboration across the University of Michigan. The Program encompasses the full range of
scientific inquiry from basic discovery science to clinical trials to health services and is dedicated to providing
early- career investigators the resources to develop research programs addressing the NEI mission and
strategic plan. It is designed around best practices, with individualized, multidisciplinary, and dedicated
mentoring teams for each scholar with a focus on continuous improvement and productivity. This approach
will produce vision clinician-scientists who can successfully translate cutting edge scientific advances into
enhanced patient treatment by advancing our understanding of the visual system and patient well-being in
both health and disease. We propose to maintain two scholars at a time who will also have considerable
departmental support until they achieve independent-researcher status. The impact of the Program will be
measured by the scientific achievements of the scholars and their career trajectory and success in
establishing independent contributions and programs."
10874487,"Many children who are hard of hearing (CHH) are identified and receive early intervention during infancy. Even with this early intervention, however, CHH are at risk for delays in language acquisition due to reduced auditory access. These challenges may have cascading effects on reading development because language plays a foundational role in reading. Much of the research on reading comprehension in children with hearing loss (HL) has focused on elementary-age children who are deaf or combined groups of CHH with children who are deaf. Because CHH have access to a qualitatively different auditory signal than children who are deaf, it is unclear if the significant delays we see with word reading and reading comprehension in children who are deaf apply to CHH in secondary grades. This lack of evidence hinders our understanding of the underlying processes that drive reading achievement in CHH, which in turn, limits the ability to develop scientifically based interventions and instruction. The current proposal is guided by the Simple View of Reading, which proposes that reading comprehension is the product of word reading and language comprehension. This proposal is also based on the Cumulative Auditory Experience model, which predicts that inconsistent auditory access in early childhood leads to reduced opportunities for language learning. Specifically, this proposal tests the hypothesis that auditory access (quantified by aided audibility and amount of hearing aid use) predicts reading comprehension growth rates in CHH, and this relationship is mediated by oral language. The current proposal will rectify some of the limitations of past research by leveraging our access to a large, well-characterized cohort of adolescents who are hard of hearing (AHH) and age-matched adolescents with normal hearing (ANH) who have been followed from preschool to 4th grade. We propose to prospectively test this cohort out to 12th grade. Our access to this cohort will allow us to conduct a rigorous longitudinal investigation of developmental trajectories in word-level decoding and text-level reading comprehension, as well as the underlying processes that drive these trajectories. We will also examine heterogeneity in sources of reading difficulty for AHH. Two aims are proposed: Aim 1. To establish developmental trajectories of reading in CHH and characterize the component reading skill profiles of AHH. We will evaluate these trajectories and profiles through a combination of retrospective (K-4th grade) and prospective (7th-12th grade) data. Aim 2. To specify the underlying processes that influence reading comprehension trajectories and outcomes in AHH and ANH. The data from this proposal will inform theoretical models of reading for children with HL, using robust and modern statistical approaches to examine reading comprehension. The proposed study will provide empirical evidence for the identification of unique component skills that support reading comprehension for young children and adolescents who are hard of hearing. This evidence will guide the development of differentiated instructional approaches and future intervention research  designed to validate these scientifically based instructional approaches."

Weight bias internalization (WBI), or self-directed weight-based stigma, has been associated with a number of
negative physical and mental health consequences for adolescents with obesity, including negative weight-
related outcomes (e.g., increased calorie consumption, poorer weight loss outcomes). The prevalence and
salience of WBI as a stressor impacting weight-related outcomes in adolescents paired with the heterogeneous
response to interventions for adolescents with obesity highlights the potential utility of combined intervention for
WBI and obesity in youth to promote improved weight management outcomes during this critical developmental
period. This K23 award is designed to fill gaps in my training and support a research study that will provide next
steps in improving the health of adolescents with obesity. The first phase of the research project will employ
focus groups and an open pilot trial to develop and test feasibility of an integrated intervention that combines
treatment for WBI with an evidence-based adolescent behavioral weight control (BWC). I will then conduct a
small RCT to test the effects of the newly designed WBI+BWC intervention on WBI and mechanisms of weight-
stigma stress induced weight gain, specifically physiological markers of stress (diurnal cortisol) and inflammation
(c-reactive protein, interleukin-6), and dysregulated eating behaviors (emotional eating, loss of control, unhealthy
weight control behaviors). I hypothesize that BWC combined with intervention for WBI, will lead to improvements
in mechanisms of weight-stigma stress induced weight gain, in turn promoting improved weight loss outcomes.
This research project has significant clinical implications for the improvement of adolescent BWC and reduction
of the negative effects of weight-based stigma in adolescents. To conduct this research and fill critical gaps in
my training that will facilitate becoming an independent investigator focused on behavioral treatment of obesity
in adolescents, I will complete a rigorous, targeted training program. The proposed training plan includes
developing expertise in 1) conducting RCTs to develop and test BWC interventions for adolescents; 2) theoretical
and conceptual models of weight-based stigma and WBI; 3) integration of mechanisms in clinical trials focused
on biological markers and dysregulated eating behaviors; and 4) professional development. This training will be
conducted under the primary mentorship of Dr. Elissa Jelalian, with co-mentors Drs. Rebecca Puhl, Stephanie
Parade, Andrea Goldschmidt, and contributor Dr. David Barker. The skills I will acquire map directly onto the
proposed research project and provide the knowledge and expertise necessary to prepare a successful R01
application by the end of the award period. The mentorship team, in combination with the rigorous academic and
training environment provided by the Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center at The Miriam Hospital and
Brown University, represent an ideal environment to accomplish these training and research goals. Through this
Career Development Award, I will establish myself as an independent investigator dedicated to the development
of novel interventions to improve health outcomes for adolescents with obesity."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating movement disorder affecting the central nervous system (CNS)
and is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In
addition to age and genetic background, environmental exposures are strongly associated with the
development of PD. Agents implicated as risk factors for PD include pesticides and heavy metals, as well
as infectious agents such as bacteria and viruses. The question of how cumulative environmental exposure
to these agents throughout lifespan can promote the development of PD and related disorders remains
largely unanswered. Inflammatory activation of glial cells in the brain is recognized as a critical early event
in the prodromal phase of PD. Still, the molecular signals regulating conversion to this damaging
inflammatory phenotype are only now being elucidated. This R35/RIVER application addresses the critical
question of how the neuro-immune axis responds to environmental exposures encountered across the
lifespan and how the combination of such exposures can trigger the onset of neurological disease through
phenotypic conversion of glial cells to a neurotoxic state. To develop a deeper understanding of the
molecular regulation of phenotypic changes in glial cells that underlie the progression from prodromal to
symptomatic disease, the proposed studies will employ sophisticated transgenic models and molecular tools
to address these scientific questions. The key scientific questions raised in this application coalesce around
three well defined and interrelated goals: 1) Determine how developmental exposure to environmental
neurotoxins modulates innate immune signaling in glial cells to alter the inflammatory response of the
neuro-immune axis to subsequent toxic exposures during aging, 2) Identify key molecular pathways in glial
cells altered by exposure to environmental neurotoxicants that regulate inflammatory responses of the brain
to viral infection, and 3) Elucidate molecular signatures in regional populations of glial cells corresponding
to various states of activation across the progression of neurological disease triggered by exposure to
environmental neurotoxicants and viruses. The scientific goals addressed by this R35/RIVER application
concerning multiple exposures across lifespan and risk for neurological disease will use both long-term
studies involving exposure to multiple neurotoxic and infectious agents, as well as powerful approaches
such as high-content imaging, neural network-based informatic analysis, single-cell and spatial
transcriptomics and generation of new transgenic models. The R35 mechanism is ideal for integrating these
complex resources and approaches with the personnel expertise necessary to address fundamental questions
about how environmental exposures alter innate immune responses of the brain that promote the
development of neurological disorders like PD and AD."
10897109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer tissues exhibit a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity and contain numerous
subpopulations of cells in various states. Quantifying this heterogeneity at the single-cell level and with molecular
depth across large numbers of cells provides information that cannot be obtained at the bulk scale and will
ultimately lead to improved diagnostics and more effective treatments. While single-cell nucleic acid sequencing
approaches are having a significant impact on cancer research, proteins mediate the bulk of cellular function
and are the targets of most therapeutics. There is thus an urgent need to develop new technologies for large-
scale direct proteome profiling at the single-cell level. To fill this gap, mass spectrometry (MS)-based profiling of
protein expression in single cells has recently been demonstrated through the implementation of more efficient
sample processing workflows, novel experimental designs and improved instrument sensitivity. Label-free MS-
based proteomics can now quantify >2,000 protein groups per cell across >4 orders of magnitude of dynamic
range, but efforts to profile more than a few dozen cells per day have resulted in significantly reduced proteome
coverage. This low throughput is insufficient for the large-scale statistically powered studies required to
characterize heterogeneity in cancer cell populations. To increase measurement throughput, multiplexed
workflows based on isobaric tandem mass tags (TMTs) enable up to 18 single cells to be measured in an LC-
MS analysis, but these have still been limited to ~100 cells/day and, as generally implemented, suffer from a
large proportion of missing values and other issues affecting quantitative performance. Our overall objective is
to develop a platform that combines simplified pipette-free high-throughput sample preparation with rapid,
multicolumn liquid chromatography separations and ‘greedy’ data-dependent acquisition to profile >2000
proteins per cell with a measurement throughput of >1000 single cells per day. We hypothesize that the
advanced sample preparation and separation, combined with a far more efficient MS acquisition workflow, will
achieve in-depth SCP with a 10× throughput gain, thus providing a capability for direct, in-depth and large-scale
protein quantification that is analogous to single-cell RNA-seq. Studies in Aim 1 will focus on developing
massively parallel centrifugal nanoliter dispensing to prepare >10,000 single-cells per day at a total reagent and
consumables cost of <$0.40/cell. In Aim 2, we will develop rapid, robust and high-peak-capacity 20-min nanoLC
separations with 100% duty cycle. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel ‘greedy’ data acquisition strategy in which
only proteotypic peptides are selected for fragmentation, and with custom automatic gain control settings and
fragmentation energy for each peptide, providing an unprecedented combination of sensitivity and throughput.
With this next-generation platform, we will profile >10,000 cells to study acquired resistance to autophagy
inhibitors in the context of autophagy-dependent triple negative breast cancer, thus establishing an innovative
platform for advancing biomedical research and individualizing therapy."

Our long-term goal is to improve the care and outcomes of all patients with multiple myeloma (MM), particularly
African American (AA) patients to reduce racial disparity. MM exhibits one of the most striking racial disparities
between AA and White persons. MM has a 2-3 fold higher incidence and occurs at much earlier age in AA
persons. We found that the outcomes of AA patients with translocation t(11;14) myeloma were inferior to White
patients even after adjusted for comorbidities, disease stage, the length of treatment, and the use of blood and
bone marrow transplantation, etc. The mechanism for this racial disparity is unclear. We recently found that MM
cells from AA patients had a higher expression of the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family member
7 (SLAMF7) and were more sensitive to the inhibition by SLAMF7 antibody crosslinking. The objective of this
proposal is to determine the effects of elotuzumab (an FDA approved, humanized SLAMF7 monoclonal
antibody) in AA and White patients with t(11;14) MM and the mechanism underlying the differences in SLAMF7
expression between AA and White patients with t(11;14) MM. Our central hypothesis is that elotuzumab is
particularly effective in AA patients with t(11;14) MM because of the higher expression of SLAMF7. Additionally,
we hypothesized that A>G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at -742 of SLAMF7 promoter affects Blimp-
1- mediated SLAMF7 gene transcription and results in the differences in SLAMF7 expression between AA
patients and White patients with t(11;14) MM. The rationale for the proposed study is that with greater
understanding of the effectiveness of elotuzumab in AA patients with t(11;14) MM and the impact of this SNP,
we will be able to develop a more effective treatment regimen and biomarkers to reduce racial disparities. We
have two specific aims. Aim 1 is to determine the clinical outcomes of AA patients with t(11;14) myeloma and
White patients with t(11;14) myeloma in response to elotuzumab-based treatment. A retrospective cohort study
incorporating patient characteristics and social economic determinants will be performed to examine the
response and outcomes between AA patients with t(11;14) myeloma and White patients with t(11;14) myeloma
treated with elotuzumab-based regimens. STAR PCORnet datamart will be used and medical records from a
total of 257 patients with t(11;14) MM will be extracted and analyzed. Aim 2 is to determine the mechanism
underlying the differences in SLAMF7 expression between AA patients with t(11;14) MM and White patients
with t(11;14) MM. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, pGL-3 luciferase reporter system, site directed
mutagenesis, and tetra primer-amplification refractory mutation system-PCR will be performed. Our research is
innovative, because it incorporates novel technology and represents a new and substantive departure and
significant advance from the status quo. Our study will not only fundamentally advance our knowledge of racial
disparitie, but also have a positive translational impact on the care and outcomes of patients with MM, a disease
that affects AA population disproportionally."
10793561,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Critical to successful innovation in treating diabetes is the development of strategies for promoting insulin
release and preventing pancreatic beta-cell destruction. Chronic demand for insulin production during insulin
resistance and diabetes exacerbates cell dysfunction and this is compounded by ER and oxidative stress. This
results in beta-cell death and loss of insulin production. Recent studies have highlighted defects in insulin
processing, insulin granule maturation, and granule docking that are also linked to all major forms of diabetes;
however conceptual gaps remain in understanding the causes of beta-cell failure and developing methods to
reverse or prevent beta-cell dysfunction.
 Our preliminary studies establish Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein alpha (referred to as human
PITPNA and mouse Pitpna), as a major regulator of insulin granule formation and secretion. PITPNA shuttles
phosphatidylinositol (PI) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for
phosphorylation by Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4-K) conversion to phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate
(PtdIns-4-P), an abundant membrane phospholipid involved in insulin granule docking and exocytosis. Our
preliminary data shows: 1) PITPNA expression is dramatically silenced in beta-cells of human T2D subjects, 2)
reduction of PITPNA in human islets both lowered cellular PI4-P levels and insulin granule maturation and
increased accumulation of proinsulin, and 3) conditional beta-cell specific deletion of Pitpna in mice (Ins-Cre;
Pitpnaflox/flox) results in decreased insulin secretion and beta-cell mass, random-fed hyperglycemia, and increased
expression of ER stress proteins in beta cells.
 Based on these data, we hypothesize that decreased PITPNA in beta-cells during T2D leads to lower
PI4-P for distribution by the TGN as well as incorporation into insulin granules, thereby disrupting granule
maturation, docking and secretion. We further hypothesize the reduced granule formation results in accumulation
of proinsulin in the ER, leading to ER stress and ultimately beta-cell death. We propose that restoration of
PITPNA in beta-cells of T2D individuals will reverse these aspects of cellular dysfunction. We expect these
studies will demonstrate that promoting PITPNA function and PI4-P formation is a novel strategy for reversing
beta-cell dysfunction in several subcellular compartments including the ER, mitochondria, and the TGN. These
studies aim to highlight restoration of PI4-P between intracellular membranes as an innovative approach for
increasing granule maturation and secretion as well as reversing beta-cell failure in major forms of diabetes."

This proposal studies how drug-induced structural changes to Y537S estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) impact anti-
tumoral activities in hormone-resistant breast cancer cells. Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer
death in the United States. Acquired resistance to hormone therapies is a leading contributor to mortality. In
approximately 40% of progressive ER+ patients, prolonged selective pressure by antiestrogenic therapies gives
raise to tumors bearing activating somatic ESR1 (the gene for ERα) mutations. These mutations resist inhibition
by clinically approved hormone therapies and engage new transcriptional programs that boost metastatic
potential. Y537S missense mutation is among the most common and enables the greatest hormone-free
transcriptional activities and resistance to antiestrogen. Next generation selective estrogen receptor degraders
(SERDs) have been clinically deployed to address this mechanism of drug resistance. However, they show
variable activities in Y537S ESR1 breast cancers and possess common side-effects that will limit their long-term
use. We recently studied how a panel of 17 selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and SERDs bind
to and affect Y537S ERα activities in breast cancer cells. We identified structurally distinct SERMs and SERDs
with improved activities in this setting. While structurally distinct, our x-ray co-crystal structures showed that the
most effective molecules engaged the same S537-E380 hydrogen bond to reinforce the therapeutic antagonist
conformation. Therefore, we hypothesize that novel ligand-dependent structural interactions will improve
therapeutic antagonistic activities in the Y537S ESR1 setting. In this study, we will leverage our library of over
100 diverse SERMs and SERDs to reveal the structural-transcriptional relationships that underlie improved anti-
cancer activities Y537S ESR1 breast cancer cells. We will start by studying how our library binds to and affects
Y537S ERα structure and anti-cancer activities (Aim 1). This approach will reveal the ligand binding modes and
structural interactions that enable potency. Next, we will study how the most effective molecules impact Y537S
ERα genomic activities including protein-protein interactions, genome binding, and transcriptional programing
(Aim 2). This approach will show whether the efficacies of SERMs and SERDs arise from alterations to Y537S
ERα genomic activities. Finally, we will reveal the anti-tumor and tissue-specific activities of the most effective
SERMs and SERDs in hormone-resistant ER+ breast cancer in vivo (Aim 3). This approach will reveal whether
our in vitro observations correspond to improved anti-cancer activities in patient-relevant tumor models. Overall,
these studies will provide detailed structural-transcriptional relationships to improve therapeutic targeting of
Y537S ERα in hormone-resistant breast cancer."

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary processes
responsible for generating phenotypic diversity within and between species. This includes discovering the
genes responsible for phenotypic divergence, identifying which changes within these genes affect the
phenotype, and determining how these changes alter molecular, cellular, and developmental processes. It
also includes figuring out how mutation and selection have worked together to give rise to these changes.
These goals will be accomplished by combining methods from developmental biology, evolutionary
genetics, genomics, and bioinformatics to study both fruit flies (Drosophila) and yeast (Saccharomyces).
Specific experiments proposed are designed to address the following three complementary questions: (1)
What are the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying phenotypic differences? (2) How do regulatory
networks composed of cis- and trans-acting factors controlling gene expression evolve? and (3) What are
the relative contributions of mutation and selection to variation in gene expression? Taken together, this
work will advance our understanding of genotype-phenotype maps and how they vary within and between
species. Genetic changes affecting the regulation of gene expression, an essential step in translating
genotypes into phenotypes, will be given particular emphasis in this work. Ultimately, lessons learned from
these studies will contribute to a general framework for predicting and interpreting patterns of genotypic and
phenotypic variation, including variation related to human health."
10845576,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Currently, ~5.7 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), representing a significant burden on
society and our healthcare system. Despite long-standing knowledge that AD involves the aberrant
accumulation of Aβ42-plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT; composed of hyperphosphorylated Tau) a
successful treatment for AD has yet to be defined. Successful therapies will likely involve the identification of
AD-risk patients and early intervention prior to disease onset. Accumulating data support that early events that
may contribute to AD-onset include the abnormal upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and
dysregulation of lipid metabolism. These features were seemingly disconnected until we recently discovered
that elevating ROS within neurons induces the formation of peroxidated lipids, which are transferred from the
neurons to surrounding glia. Within glia, these lipids form LD and are, presumably, resolved. Inhibiting this
process drives ROS-induced neurotoxicity. During chronic neuronal ROS, glia become overrun with LD and
die, leaving the neurons vulnerable. This pathway is conserved in flies and mice, with supportive human data.
 Currently, we are uncovering the potential role of glial LD formation in AD. Preliminary data in Drosophila
demonstrate that genes defined as risk factors for AD by GWAS converge onto the glial LD formation pathway.
ABCA transporters, ABCA1 and ABCA7, are required in stressed neurons for glial LD formation, likely for the
export of peroxidated lipids. Further, four genes – LRP1, PICALM, CD2AP, and AP2A2 – are required in glia,
likely for the uptake of peroxidated lipids. We also found that the disease gene, Tau, is required within glia for
LD formation. Last, preliminary and published data support that disrupting glial LD formation may drive
extracellular Aβ42 accumulation, NFT formation, and disease. Overall, we hypothesize that glial LD formation
is an early event that attenuates elevated ROS in healthy brains and this process becomes prematurely
defective in AD. Building upon our current data, we will define potential contributions of glial LD formation
defects on ROS-induced neurodegeneration, insoluble Aβ42 buildup, and NFT formation. Aim 1 will investigate
AD-risk genes and AD-associated variants for involvement in glial LD formation during elevated ROS in
neurons using novel humanized fly models. Aim 2 will focus on Tau as a potential mediator of glial LD
formation in novel and established fly models, defining differing impacts of human Tau isoforms and mutations,
and assessing if defects in glial LD formation can contribute to the phosphorylation/ aggregation of Tau. Last,
Aim 3 will explore defined mechanisms from flies in mammalian systems. Initially, an established rat
neuron:glia co-culture model that can measure lipid transfer from stressed neurons to glia and their
accumulation into glial LD will be used to test if AD-risk genes and Tau can mediate this process. Further,
pathological studies will be performed on post-mortem AD tissue to determine correlations between LD
presence and disease features (e.g. Aβ42-plaques, NFT, disease severity, and presence of AD-risk variants)."
10867420,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Older adults with frailty are more likely to experience poor health outcomes after acute illnesses, drug-related
adverse events, and surgeries. Health care costs for frail patients double due to acute hospital care, post-acute
care, and treatments for preventable conditions. Despite clinical and societal consequences of frailty, frailty is
rarely assessed in clinical practice and little evidence exists on how to integrate frailty to inform clinical care and
population health management. The critical step to generate this evidence is to measure frailty on a large scale
with high accuracy and efficiency. To address this need, the investigator team recently developed and validated
a claims-based frailty index (CFI), which enables measurement of frailty from Medicare data for large populations
when in-person assessment is not feasible. The objective of this application is to generate evidence needed for
frailty-guided clinical care and population health management by applying CFI to claims data-based studies of
drug therapy; pragmatic clinical trials of procedural therapy; and electronic health records (EHR)-Medicare linked
data of a health care system. The central hypothesis is that frailty information will improve care of older adults
by uncovering meaningful variations in the treatment benefit-harm profile, costs, and resource needs. To test
this hypothesis, the investigator team with extensive expertise in frailty, pharmacoepidemiologic methods, and
health services research will accomplish the following specific aims in the next 5 years: 1) determine how frailty
changes the benefits and harms of 10 prescription drugs for chronic conditions in older adults by applying CFI
to the 2014-2022 5% Medicare random sample; 2) determine how frailty changes the benefits and harms of
procedural therapies in older adults by applying CFI to Medicare data linked to 2 ongoing pragmatic clinical trials
of endovascular vs surgical revascularization therapy for peripheral arterial disease and acupuncture vs usual
care for chronic low back pain; and 3) determine whether implementing CFI to EHR-Medicare linked data can
predict high-cost and high-need patients in a large health care system in Boston, Massachusetts. The innovative
applications of CFI are readily scalable to claims-based comparative effectiveness and safety studies, clinical
trials, and EHR in health care systems. The impact of this research is significant because the clinically actionable
evidence generated from this research can enable optimal choice of drug and procedural therapy and a health
system-wide risk stratification based on frailty. Ultimately, these results will accelerate integration of frailty in
routine care and facilitate frailty-guided clinical care and population health management."
10866555,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
To prepare ourselves for the aging of our increasingly diverse population, we must increase minority
representation in the sciences, and train young researchers to understand neurocognitive aging and
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), and associated health disparities. CSUF and USC
propose an innovative and transformative program entitled, “Neurocognitive Aging & Analytics Research
Education (NAARE)” that builds upon our current biomedical research education program on data science and
brain health. In the coming decades, the United States and the world will face a rapidly growing aging
population, with an insufficient number of experts trained in ADRD research to accommodate this increase.
Even though ethnic and racial minorities, including African Americans, Latinos and Native Americans/Alaskans
comprise over a third of the U.S. population, they are under-represented in aging studies, leaving us with
insufficient knowledge of the genetic and environmental risk factors that contribute to cognitive decline in these
populations. The representation of minorities in science and biomedical fields also remains comparatively low.
Increasing the number of trained researchers from these underrepresented groups may provide insights into
social contextual issues and other factors related to underrepresentation, which may subsequently promote
access to these important populations in order to subsequently improve health disparities related to
neurocognitive aging in these vulnerable populations. Therefore increasing the number of underrepresented
aging researchers continues to be a high national priority. The NAARE program addresses this gap as follows:
Aim 1: Provide NAARE scholars hands-on research experiences: Engage three consecutive cohorts (n =
10 per year) of predominantly underrepresented minority undergraduates (50% female) in a 1.5 - year faculty
mentored, student-driven research focusing on neurocognitive aging, ADRD, and related health disparities
and modifiable risk factors. Aim 2: Develop educational curricula: Traditional and multimedia curricula will
be developed for NAARE scholars and also targeted towards a larger diverse student audience (n = 4,500) on
the following: basic science behind normal brain aging and ADRD; health disparities, modifiable risk factors
and neurocognitive aging; neuroimaging and analytics; and research methods in neurocognitive aging. Aim 3:
NAARE Scholar Graduate/Career Preparation: To ensure sustainability and student success, NAARE
students will engage in ongoing faculty advising, receive exhaustive graduate school application support via
hands-on guidance, and explore first-hand, research intensive universities. In-depth mentored, yet student-
owned research experiences that integrate intensive neurocognitive aging and ADRD training, and belonging
in the broader scientific community will result in successful future scientists. This program will lead to a greater
number of students from underrepresented backgrounds choosing careers in neurocognitive aging and
succeeding at them. Our students will become diverse role models for future students for generations to come."
11023021,"Non-healing ischemic wounds are a major problem for Veterans with physical impairment and/or disability.
These chronic wounds cause significant pain and disability and occur at an alarmingly high frequency in at-risk
Veteran populations cared for by the Veterans Healthcare Administration (VHA). The use of electrical
stimulation (ES) for ischemic wound therapy has long been known but the outcomes have been variable. In
previous work we developed an untethered electronic bandage with all the components of a surface stimulation
system mounted on a flexible substrate. We systematically investigated the effects of a range of clinically
relevant ES and found two paradigms that significantly enhanced healing in a rat ischemic wound model. One
of these paradigms was also found to significantly reduce wound infection in an acute preclinical model of
clinically relevant large wounds.
The project will provide translational development and testing in a relevant large animal model of the Smart
Modular Adaptive Electrotherapy Delivery System (SmartMAEDS) to provide both treatment and remote
monitoring of chronic ischemic wounds. The patented SmartMAEDS system is an innovative approach
incorporating both ES and real-time wound monitoring. SmartMAEDS will reduce cost and improve healing
efficacy by providing therapeutic ES in a bandage that does not need to be repositioned for each treatment
session thus improving uniformity of ES therapy. SmartMAEDS also provides innovative remote monitoring
capabilities to reduce unnecessary dressing changes. By assessing wound bed impedance, SmartMAEDS will
monitor progress towards healing. SmartMAEDS will also check for early indications of infection by monitoring
wound bed temperature.
Development of the Smart MAEDS system will include refinement of the disposable flexible substrate and the
reusable stimulation/control module. Our collaborators at Koronis Biomedical Technologies will develop two
software applications to manage SmartMAEDS wireless communication. StimCheck will run in the background
providing instant feedback on connection status. StimMANAGE will provide a clinical user interface for real
time monitoring of wound status including graphical history and trends, enabling the clinician to control and
modify therapy as needed. We will evaluate SmartMAEDS in a pig model of ischemic wounds of a clinically
relevant size. ES paradigms shown to enhance healing and reduce infection in our preliminary work will be
assessed. Quantitative non-destructive in vivo assessment methodologies will include monitoring of tissue
ischemia and progressive wound healing using transcutaneous blood gas levels and serial 3D digital
photography. Wound status at fixed timepoints will be evaluated using histology, histomorphometry,
immunohistochemistry and rt-PCR to determine the expression of over 80 genes involved in all stages of
wound healing. Planktonic bacterial infection status, biofilm formation and microbial community profiling will
also be evaluated following protocols developed in our previous work.
Prototype SmartMAEDS devices have been developed under the Advanced Platform Technology Center
Quality Systems/Design Control-program. A multidisciplinary clinical expert review panel will ensure that this
new approach to chronic wound therapy will be highly acceptable to clinical users. The effective treatment of
chronic wounds is integral to providing the highest standards of health care for Veterans. Translational pre-
clinical evaluation of SmartMAEDS using a valid animal model will provide a strong foundation for effective
translation to clinical care. Our collaboration with Koronis Biomedical Technologies will support pre-market
development of a user-friendly bandage that can be worn for up to five days, concurrently delivering treatment
and monitoring wound status. SmartMAEDS will be a disruptive value-driven technology in the wound care
market at lower cost to VHA providing increased clinical benefit for Veterans with chronic wounds."
10853026,"Project Summary/Abstract. Excess adiposity is associated with metabolic changes that significantly increase
the risk of developing 13 types of cancer. It is estimated that up to 20% of cancer cases are caused by obesity
and that obesity prevention can play a significant role in the reduction of cancer incidence. Among obese
adolescents, the most rapid weight gain has been shown to occur between 2 and 6 years of age. Despite clear
connections between these factors and obesity risk, the study of obesity in early childhood is limited by the lack
of body composition technologies appropriate for this age range. The long term goal of the Shape Up! Keiki is 1)
to provide pediatric phenotype descriptors of health derived from detailed body shape scans from high-speed
and high depth resolution 3D cameras, and 2) to provide the tools to visualize and quantify body shape in
research and clinical practice. Our approach addresses technology issues that have hindered body composition
research in this age range including participants' inability to hold still, follow directions, small body size, and rapid
fluid shifts. To develop our body composition models, we will recruit 360 ethnically-diverse children from birth to
5 years stratified by sex and BMI-Z. Our central hypothesis is that optical estimates of body composition suitably
represent a 5-compartment (5C) body composition model for studies of adiposity and health in young children
and are superior to that of simple anthropometry and demographics. Our specific aims and subaims are as
follows: 1) identify the statistical shape descriptors from 3DO scans that best represent 5-compartment body
composition in an ethnically-diverse pediatric population, 1(a) identify the relationships that best link 3DO shape
descriptors of body subregions (arms, legs, trunk), and matching volumes and body composition measures, 1(b)
calibrate automated 3DO anthropometry to clinically relevant girths and lengths, Exploratory) identify accessible
combinations of 3DO and TBW that can be calibrated to criterion 5C measures of fat and hydration, 2) identify
the factors that define the precision of accessible 3D optical body composition estimates to monitor change in
body composition and metabolic health interventions, 3) contrast the association of body shape, 3DO, and 5C
criterion body composition to pediatric health indicators including clinically relevant exposures (SES, nursing
duration, birth method, nutrition) and development. The rationale for this study is that early life access to accurate
body composition data will enable identification of factors that increase obesity, metabolic disease, and cancer
risk, and provide a means to target interventions to those that would benefit. The expected outcome is that our
findings would be immediately applicable to accessible gaming and imaging sensors found on modern
computers."
10887582,"mRNA ASSEMBLY IN DROSOPHILA GERM GRANULES
Development of every species relies critically on spatially organized messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Indeed, even a
single asymmetrically distributed mRNA can specify the morphology of cells, the body plan of a developing
organism and cell lineages across metazoans. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) typically organize mRNAs and
recruit them to subcellular structures. However, mRNAs can also self-organize into multi-mRNA assemblies
independently of other cellular components. mRNA assemblies are found in healthy cells in different species
and are often associated with RNA granules, membraneless ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that regulate
translation and stability of mRNAs. mRNA assemblies are also a hallmark of pathogenesis in human repeat
expansion disorders such as myotonic dystrophy 1 (MD1), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and
spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). These findings indicate that mRNA assembly is an inherent property of an mRNA
that could be biologically relevant. However, the exact mechanism and potential biological functions of mRNA
assembly is unclear. mRNAs have been shown to self-assemble by phase separation, a process akin to oil-and-
water de-mixing. Here, RNA:RNA interactions, which promote intermolecular (trans) base-pairing and
secondary (cis) RNA structures have been implicated in driving mRNA assembly. In addition, in vitro data
suggest that RNA helicases, which are core constituents of RNA granules are thought to dissolve RNA:RNA
interactions in granules. In light of these findings, several critical questions arise. How do mRNAs
self-assemble in granules designed to prevent RNA:RNA interactions? What is the role of mRNA assemblies in
RNA granules? What is the function of trans and cis RNA:RNA interactions and RNA helicases in the
formation and function of mRNA assemblies and RNA granules? The five-year goal of this study is to
answer these questions and determine the mechanism and biological function of mRNA
assembly in Drosophila germ granules. mRNA assemblies tend to form as small clusters that are acutely
sensitive to the concentration and the environment in which they form. Thus, the central challenge in
studying mRNA assembly is that methods must be employed that enable examination of this process in
vivo and with high resolution and sensitivity. We will use genetic and quantitative, super-resolution
imaging approaches to analyze mRNA assembly in intact cells and within their natural cellular
context. We aim to uncover new insight into how organisms harness mRNA assemblies to promote
development and how misregulation of mRNA assembly could contribute to human diseases, such as MD1,
ALS and SCA."
10830950,"Background: Prior to the pandemic, the approximately 10,000 Veterans on insulin pumps (VIPs) were
excluded from VA telehealth programs due to the complexity of their care and their risk of adverse events
(AEs). The lack of enrollment of VIPs in VA telehealth programs resulted in a gap in knowledge of best
practices for remote insulin pump management, making pandemic-related disruptions in care especially difficult
and riskier for these Veterans. The urgency to switch all Veterans to telehealth for non-emergent care during
the pandemic resulted in the need for VIPs and providers to adapt to new care processes and quickly “piece
together” data-sharing technologies to overcome barriers and maintain safe and effective care. The objective
of this study is to address the gap in knowledge of best practices for remote insulin pump management to
mitigate adverse effects the ongoing pandemic has on high-risk VIPs. The long-term goal of this research is to
establish an evidence-based telehealth program for safe and effective remote insulin pump management to
improve access to remote care for VIPs and meet the growing demand for insulin pump therapy.
Significance: This study will inform the advancement of telehealth processes and tools for remote insulin
pump management that will: (1) benefit vulnerable Veterans living in rural communities and other Veterans
who face access challenges, (2) expand care options for Veterans with diabetes who may be candidates for
insulin pump therapy but are unable to access VA specialty care, and (3) enhance VIPs ability to connect with
their care team for critical real-time troubleshooting of unexpected device failures and prevention of AEs.
Expanding Veteran access to remote insulin pump management assures continued quality care and
connection for VIPs and supports VA's clinical and legislative goals of improving Veteran access to care.
Specific Aims:
1. Characterize the pandemic's impact on VIP outcomes, including process of care and clinical
 outcomes. Using a longitudinal observational design, we will examine VIP process of care and clinical
 outcomes over a 3-year period beginning 1.5 years prior to onset of the pandemic. We will use mixed
 effects and Cox regression models to compare outcomes before and during the pandemic while accounting
 for practice, provider, and patient-level covariates that are likely to influence the outcomes of interest.
2. Examine VIPs' and providers' experiences and satisfaction with insulin pump management before
 and during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify barriers to and facilitators of safe and effective
 remote care. We will conduct structured interviews with a VIPs and providers and apply rapid qualitative
 analysis to examine experiences and satisfaction with insulin pump management before and during the
 COVID-19 pandemic and identify barriers to and facilitators of safe and effective remote care.
3. Develop recommendations to advance telehealth processes and tools for safe and effective remote
 insulin pump management. We will integrate our findings from Aims 1 and 2 using joint displays and
 review them with a VA Expert Advisory Panel and VIP representatives to generate recommendations for
 immediate improvement to remote insulin pump management and for future research.
Methodology: We selected a mixed-methods design to expand the breadth of our inquiry by obtaining an
account of pandemic-related outcomes through our quantitative analysis and a sense of the process of
transitioning VIPs to telehealth through our qualitative analysis. We will use our integrated findings to generate
recommendations to improve how VA delivers remote care to VIPs moving forward.
Next Steps/Implementation: Our partners at the VA National Endocrinology/Diabetes Program Office, VA
Office of Rural Health, and VA Office of Connected Care will provide guidance and support throughout our
study and facilitate the rapid dissemination of our findings across VA."
10896926,"R01: A kinetic framework to map the genetic determinants of alternative RNA isoform
expression
Project Summary
At the core of the central dogma is the transcription of RNA, which enables instructions from DNA to be
translated into protein messages. The biogenesis of mRNA is a complex and highly regulated process, re-
quiring coordination between transcriptional and RNA processing machinery that each comprise hundreds
of regulatory RNAs and proteins. These interactions often result in many possible alternative isoforms ex-
pressed from a single gene. While we can now extensively catalog the abundance and variability of mRNA
isoforms across cellular states, we are still limited in our abilities to predict coordination between the mech-
anistic steps that give rise to cellular diversity. Most catalogs of mRNA levels only profile steady-state
mRNA and are blind to the spatiotemporal dynamics regulating isoform choice and expression. However,
the trajectory and fate of an mRNA molecule likely depends on the efficiency of kinetic interactions at each
step of mRNA biogenesis. Thus, we must directly track mRNA fluxes on timescales commensurate with the
regulatory decisions being made to estimate the rates of each step of mRNA biogenesis.
 While high-throughput approaches to quantify steady-state RNA levels have matured in the past decade,
it is still challenging to quantify nascent RNA and infer the rates of core mRNA biogenesis steps including
transcription initiation, elongation, splicing, and 3’ end cleavage. Both technical and mechanistic features
confound direct kinetic measurements from nascent RNA sequencing data. Existing approaches to quan-
tify rates of these steps have found extensive variability in these rates across genes and cell types, but have
been limited in their ability to estimate rates of alternative processing decisions, identify kinetic coordina-
tion between splicing or 3’ end cleavage events, and map genetic elements that underlie kinetic variability.
We propose to address these challenges by developing a joint experimental and statistical framework to
characterize the molecular and genetic factors affecting RNA processing rates.
 First, we will build a statistical model to estimate RNA processing rates at individual sites, and generate
time-resolved short-read nascent RNA-sequencing data to train this model. Second, we will characterize ki-
netic competition between individual events that underlies alternative isoform expression using a constrained
state space model and generate long-read RNA sequencing data to identify expressed isoform trajectories.
Third, we will estimate RNA processing rates in a population of genotyped human cells to identify quan-
titative trait loci (QTL) associated with variability in RNA processing rates. For all three aims, we identify
rigorous validation metrics and calibrate the uncertainty in our rate predictions. Together, our work will lead
to i) a better understanding of how molecular coordination and genetic variants regulate the rates and deci-
sion points in RNA processing, ii) a generalizable genomics framework for quantifying these rates, and iii) a
QTL resource to interpret human disease-associated genotypes acting through rate-distorting mechanisms."
10913312,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Advances in breast cancer treatment have resulted in significant survival gains. However, cure or control of
breast cancer is not necessarily accompanied by full restoration of health. We have shown that as breast cancer
survivors age, they experience accelerated chemotherapy-induced functional decline compared to age-matched
survivors not treated with chemotherapy and women without cancer. Chemotherapy-induced functional decline
results in poor quality of life, loss of independence, and premature death. The proposed study builds on our
clinical work showing that cellular senescence is a central process linked to chemotherapy-induced functional
decline. Cellular senescence is a fundamental aging process characterized by cell cycle arrest. Senescent cells
accumulate in aging tissues and secrete proinflammatory factors that drive age-related functional decline. We
have observed that, in breast cancer survivors, chemotherapy induces the persistent presence of high levels of
circulating senescent cells, and that survivors with high senescent cell burden are more likely to experience
chemotherapy-induced fatigue, neuropathy, and functional decline. These data provide rationale for targeting
and reducing senescent cells to alleviate chemotherapy-induced functional decline. In non-cancer populations,
senescent cells can be reduced through use of exercise or senolytics (drugs that ablate senescent cells). Recent
preclinical studies also showed that senolytics combined with exercise yielded a greater reduction in senescent
cells compared to either intervention alone. However, the ability of exercise and senolytics to reduce senescent
cells and, ultimately, improve physical function in breast cancer survivors has not been tested. We hypothesize
that targeting senescent cells via exercise and senolytics in breast cancer survivors will yield independent and
additive effects to improve physical function and reduce markers of biological aging. To test this hypothesis, we
propose a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial to test the efficacy of exercise and senolytic therapy
(alone or combined) on physical function and markers of biological aging. We will randomize chemotherapy-
treated postmenopausal breast cancer survivors with diminished function, assessed using the 6-minute walk
distance [6MWD], to 1 of 4 arms: exercise + senolytic; exercise alone; senolytic alone; or control. The primary
endpoint will be the change in 6MWD from baseline to end of treatment (Aim 1). Secondary endpoints include
clinical and biological aging markers (Aim 2). We also will assess the safety and adherence of both interventions.
In summary, as the number of breast cancer survivors rises dramatically (estimated to be >6 million by 2040),
mitigating chemotherapy-induced functional decline is an urgent public health issue and a priority of the NIH.
Successful completion of this trial will establish the efficacy of two targeted treatments to mitigate chemotherapy-
induced functional decline. Given that senescence underlies many mid- and late-life chronic diseases, a safe
treatment that improves physical function would have a major positive impact that extends far beyond oncology."
10844642,"Project Summary
Approximately 20% of all human cancers contain a mutation in the KRAS oncogene that drives their growth
and metastasis. Novel KRAS inhibitors have recently been developed that disable these growth signals.
Although they help patients live longer, KRAS inhibitors are unlikely to cure patients. For this reason, there is a
need to identify more effective ways to treat KRAS mutant cancers. Based on the success of cancer
immunotherapy, an appealing strategy has been to combine targeted therapies with agents that activate the
immune system to attack. Macrophages are cells of the innate immune system and are often the most
common infiltrating immune cell in solid tumors. The CD47/SIRPa axis is a key regulator of macrophage
activation in the tumor microenvironment and acts as a “don’t eat me” signal. Anti-CD47 antibodies that block
this macrophage immune checkpoint can stimulate macrophage activation against cancer. In this proposal, we
hypothesize that KRAS inhibitors make cancer cells more vulnerable to macrophage-mediated destruction, and
consequently, that KRAS inhibitors will synergize with anti-CD47 antibodies to eliminate KRAS mutant cancers.
Our overall goal is to convert KRAS-targeted therapies into curative therapies by engaging macrophages as
effectors.
To investigate potential synergy between KRAS inhibitors and anti-CD47 antibodies, we have developed a
novel in vitro co-culture assay to evaluate macrophage-mediated destruction of cancer. We will use this assay
to measure synergy between KRAS inhibitors and anti-CD47 antibodies (Aim 1). We will investigate the
mechanism of synergy by assessing how KRAS inhibitors change the expression and function of other
immunoregulatory molecules on the surface of KRAS mutant cancer cells. Next, we will test the combination
therapy in xenograft mouse models of KRAS mutant cancer to evaluate for enhanced anti-tumor immunity in
vivo (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the effects of the combination therapy in immunocompetent, syngeneic
tumor models to understand how the combination therapy alters interactions between the innate and adaptive
immune systems. Overall, we propose a novel mechanism to enhance the efficacy of KRAS inhibitors by
merging the fields of immuno-oncology and precision medicine. We expect our findings to provide the rationale
for rapidly translating this combination strategy to the clinic to benefit patients with KRAS mutant cancer."

 Passive sensing of Latina women's daily living experience as proxy measures of health risk must be brought
to scale. We propose to validate the integrated measurements from Fitbits, smartphones, purpose-built
environmental sensors (Beacon), GPS, and a purpose-built smartphone app (Hornsense), to assess physical
activity, sleep, and environmental exposures as they relate to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and MetS-related
brain vulnerability. We will develop a pipeline to create and interpret networks signifying how MetS relate to brain
integrity in Latina women and identify which environmental factors contribute to increased risk for MetS.
 To achieve these goals, we synergize expertise from multiple disciplines, advance pilot data, and ground-truth
novel integrated measures. First, it is essential to define how MetS risk manifests in this sample by identifying
how MetS affects brain integrity in a subsample of Latina women compared to white women (n=225) and
compare these methods to traditional clinical assessments of MetS (defined by AHA/NHLBI). Measures of
cerebral metabolism (N-acetyl aspartate, NAA, myo-inositol, mI and glutamate, Glu) will form a network of risk
and brain vulnerability. Daily living will be assessed in 1,000 women (60% Latina) through 30 days of dense
sensing in the home environment. Participants will wear Fitbit Inspire devices and have the Hornsense app on
their cell phones. Environmentally, we will validate the purpose-built Beacon, which measures environmental
factors of particulate matter (PM2.5,- allergens that influence air quality), nitrogen oxides (NOx - gases within
smog), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature, relative humidity (RH), and amount of
noise, first against research-grade reference instruments in well-controlled sleep chambers and smart test
homes, and second in participant homes. During the dense sensing, Beacons and Personal Air Quality Monitor
(PAM) will be placed in the bedroom and outside the home for one month. The 24 hours of activity, location, and
all environmental values will be compared with MetS risk and MetS-related brain vulnerability because brain
integrity is among the earliest markers of vulnerability, representing a high risk for poor health outcomes and
quality of life in older age. Network analysis of these data will identify the critical central nodes of risk.
 Scaling our pilot sensing protocols will determine the feasibility and efficacy of integrated measurements of
daily behavior, activity, sleep, and environmental attributes to predict MetS and MetS-related brain vulnerability
in Latina women. Identifying valid strategies for targeting individual behaviors and contexts is essential for future
prevention efforts to be designed with greater precision, particularly for Latina women."

This resubmission responds to PAR-MH-21-135 (Development of Psychosocial Therapeutic and Preventive
Interventions for Mental Disorders, R61/R33), addressing the PAR by sequentially testing a new intervention
that is translated from basic science and that uses a multi-modal approach to assessing and modifying an
objectively measured target. The overarching goal is to evaluate a new blended mobile intervention that is
aimed at improving introspective accuracy (IA) in people with psychotic disorders, with the ultimate goal of
improving functional outcome. Introspective accuracy is the degree to which one’s self-assessment of task
performance or abilities corresponds with objective data. Our group and others have demonstrated that poor
IA is a strong and independent predictor of functional disability. Yet, there are currently no treatments that
directly target IA. Basic experimental research and other lines of evidence suggest IA is malleable, and that
improvement in task-based IA transfers to untrained tasks. This project’s premise is that task-based IA training
could be delivered in a remote mobile health format and coupled with coaching in applying improved IA to real-
world functional behaviors, creating a novel avenue for functional rehabilitation in psychotic disorders. We
have developed and completed usability testing of iTEST, a novel blended mobile intervention. iTEST
integrates graduated drill-and-practice training delivered on a mobile device that targets IA with personalized
coaching in applying IA to everyday compensatory behaviors. In the R61 phase, we will recruit people with
psychotic disorders with at least minimal functional impairment. We will first conduct a pilot study to finalize a
fully ready-for-deployment version of iTEST. Next, we propose an open trial of iTEST, evaluating whether the
intervention leads to clinically significant changes in task-based IA along with transfer to an untrained task
(target mechanisms). We will also determine the dose of intervention needed to achieve clinically significant
improvement in IA targets, by evaluating change at 8, 12, or 16 weeks. If go/no go criteria (clinically
significant increases in trained and untreated introspective accuracy) are met in the R61 phase, the R33 phase
includes a randomized controlled trial contrasting iTEST with a control condition that provides training in goal
setting and cognitive compensation but does not include task-based IA training. We will evaluate whether
iTEST leads to greater improvement in IA and functional outcome, whether these improvements are sustained
at follow up, and whether increases in IA mediate improvements in functional outcome. This project responds
directly to NIMH Strategic Aim 3.1, by evaluating a new intervention that targets functioning by modifying an
objectively measured target. Our project also responds to the NIMH Digital Health Priority Area by advancing
mobile interventions for cognitive rehabilitation. If effective, iTEST could be integrated with many cognitive
training and other rehabilitative interventions to boost impact on functional outcomes."

The increase in diabetes patients in countries where tuberculosis (TB) is also endemic has led to the re-emerging
importance of diabetes as a serious risk factor for TB. There is an urgent need to implement strategies for TB
prevention and control among the millions of diabetes patients exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
the causative agent of TB. Although diabetes is known to modulate immune responses, most of the studies on
TB-diabetes comorbidity have been primarily focused on the altered functions of lymphocytes. Lung
macrophages are among the first host cells that respond to Mtb and are recognized as one of the most crucial
cell types in determining the consequences of disease. Our previous work has demonstrated that lung
macrophage metabolism plays a critical role in promoting or controlling the progression of TB. However, whether
the increased susceptibility to TB in diabetes is caused by altered metabolic activities in lung macrophages is
virtually unknown, thus representing a significant knowledge gap. The phenotype and functions of tissue-resident
macrophages are greatly influenced by the level of nutrients in their environmental niches. Given that diabetes
induces chronic hyperglycemia, a key factor that contributes to the development of TB in diabetic conditions, we
hypothesize that the altered metabolism in lung macrophages, due to the hyperglycemic environment, leads to
increased susceptibility to TB in diabetes. We will test this hypothesis with two aims: Aim 1. Determine the impact
of hyperglycemia on the metabolic status and permissiveness of lung AMs during Mtb infection. Aim 2.
Interrogate how hyperglycemia influences the heterogeneity of lung macrophages in TB. We will use multi-
disciplinary approaches, including metabolism, genomics and microbiology to interrogate the underlying
mechanism of TB-diabetes comorbidity from a completely novel perspective."

The episodic nature of psychiatric disorders suggests that the brain shifts between pathological and healthy
brain states. Fear and anxiety have been correlated with changes in oscillations between the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) and abnormalities in these networks have been identified in
patients with a range of psychiatric disorders and we propose that these networks may impact emotional
processing more broadly. However, we understand very little about the mechanism(s) whereby networks shift
between states. 5α-reduced neurosteroids, including allopregnanolone, have been suggested to play a role in
affective switching and have been shown to exert robust anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in preclinical
models and in clinical trials. In fact, an allopregnanolone analog recently received FDA approval for the
treatment of postpartum depression. The current study builds on these findings to investigate the potential role
of endogenous neurosteroids in mediating transitions between healthy and unhealthy network and behavioral
states. Given that stress has been implicated in numerous psychiatric disorders, we propose to utilize a chronic
unpredictable stress (CUS) model to evaluate the impact on mPFC-BLA network function. We propose that
stress disrupts network function by impairing local neurosteroid signaling in the BLA (supported by preliminary
data) and that increasing the capacity for endogenous neurosteroidogenesis can restore healthy network
function. Our proposed mechanism involves the action of neurosteroids on GABAAR δ subunit-containing
receptors, expressed at a high density in parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons in the BLA, which are known to
modulate oscillations within and between the mPFC-BLA. Thus, this application will test the hypothesis that
deficits in endogenous 5α-reduced neurosteroid signaling in the BLA, via δ-subunit containing GABAARs on PV
interneurons, contribute to the stress-induced impairments in network and behavioral states."

The long-term objective of this application is to define the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive the
pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with the goal of identifying therapeutic strategies. NASH
is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease characterized by sublethal hepatocyte lipotoxicity (i.e.,
toxic lipid-induced cellular stress, which does not induce cell death) and consequent liver tissue inflammation.
The overall objective of this proposal is to examine: (a) how sublethal lipotoxicity in hepatocytes triggers the
release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) to augment liver immune infiltration by pathogenic CD4+ T helper cells;
and (b) how these abnormal processes during NASH can be therapeutically reversed. To this end, we have
made several pivotal observations. First, we found that sublethal lipotoxicity in hepatocytes activates Rho-
associated protein kinase (ROCK) 1 by a caspase-6-dependent mechanism. Moreover, genetic ablation of
ROCK1 specifically in hepatocytes attenuates NASH-associated liver injury and fibrosis in mice.
Mechanistically, ROCK1 is critical for the release of lipotoxicity-induced EVs and their enrichment in activated
leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), a ligand for the CD6 receptor expressed by CD4+ T cells.
Consistent with ALCAM enrichment, hepatocyte-derived lipotoxic EVs significantly enhance migration of CD4+
T helper cells in an ALCAM-dependent manner. Finally, activated CD4+ T cells are enriched in NASH livers,
and their depletion attenuates murine NASH. Based on these preliminary observations, we propose the
CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that sublethal lipotoxic signals induce ROCK1 activation in hepatocytes, which
results in the release of pathogenic EVs that promote CD4+ T cell-mediated hepatic inflammation during
NASH. We will now employ in vitro experimental approaches, animal models, and human biospecimens to
examine the HYPOTHESIS in three integrated SPECIFIC AIMS. First, we will test the hypothesis that
sublethal lipotoxicity activates ROCK1 through: a) an incomplete mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization; and b) non-lethal proteolytic activity of caspase-6. Second, we will investigate how sublethal
lipotoxicity in hepatocytes results in: a) the release of ALCAM-bearing EVs; and b) the stimulation of CD6
receptor expressed on CD4+ T helper cells, leading to their recruitment into the liver. Third, we will test the
hypothesis that in a murine model of NASH: a) CD6 inhibition attenuates NASH by preventing CD4+ T cell
infiltration of the liver; and b) specific ROCK1 inhibition reverses NASH progression. Finally, the human
disease relevance of our findings from the preclinical studies will be assessed using well-annotated human
liver tissue specimens. This technically and conceptually innovative application is also significant because
it provides mechanistic insights into hepatocyte-to-CD4+ T helper cell crosstalk in NASH, thus identifying viable
therapeutic interventions, such as inhibition of ROCK1 kinase activity or CD4+ T cell-associated CD6 receptor."

 Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020, increasing
evidence has shown that the disease affects multiple organs, including the central nervous system (CNS).
Effects of COVID-19 on the CNS in the acute phase were documented clinically, by magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), by plasma biomarkers and at autopsy, with neurological symptoms
manifesting in 1/3 to 2/3 of hospitalized, severe cases. After the acute phase, approximately 10% of patients
experience prolonged illness, during which neurological symptoms (headaches, cognitive blunting, and fatigue)
are among the top 10 symptoms reported by COVID-19 survivors. The underlying biology of these prolonged
symptoms is unknown; therefore, prospective studies to systematically investigate the pathophysiology of such
sequelae are urgently needed.
 Based on the clinical presentation of COVID-19, reports of COVID-related symptoms in the months
following the infection, including reports of Parkinsonism and other delayed neurological and neurocognitive
complications ranging from mild-to-severe, and known peripheral triggers of cerebral pathology,
neuroinflammation (Aim 1), neurodegeneration (Aim 2) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) (Aim 3) are
expected to be important components of long-term CNS pathophysiology.
 The COVID BRain Advanced Imaging Network (COVID-BRAIN) was formed as a Consortium of six
institutions to systematically and prospectively elucidate the long-term CNS pathophysiology of COVID-19
using highly sensitive, harmonized, advanced MRI/MRS technology at 3 tesla in conjunction with standardized
neurological and neuropsychological evaluation and inflammatory blood biomarkers. Five sites that currently
partner in other multi-site neuroimaging initiatives (University of Minnesota, Mayo Clinic Rochester, Harvard
University/Massachusetts General Hospital, Johns Hopkins University, Houston Methodist Research Institute)
will collect longitudinal multi-modal MRI (T1, FLAIR, diffusion MRI, susceptibility-weighted MRI, single- and
multi-voxel MRS and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling), clinical, neurocognitive and blood biomarker
data from laboratory confirmed post-COVID cases with neurological symptoms (N=200) and matched controls
(N=100). The Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) at the University of Southern California will serve as the
data management site. Group differences and change over time in MR markers indicative of
neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, hypoxia/ischemia and CVD and their associations with specific
neurological symptoms, cognitive function, and inflammatory blood biomarkers will be investigated.
 The mechanistic insights provided by this study will inform the care and treatment of patients that are
expected to suffer long-term consequences of the pandemic for the years to come."

The neurodegenerative condition known as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasingly placing a burden on our
health care system, patients, and their families. One factor that appears to contribute to neurodegeneration, and
distinguishes the development of AD from normal ageing, is cellular senescence. However, the mechanisms,
causes and consequences of cellular senescence in AD and associated neuropathology remain poorly
understood. A recent study demonstrated a role for the lysosomal sphingolipid enzyme acid ceramidase (AC) in
ageing and senescence. Deregulation of sphingolipid metabolism has been documented in AD pathology, but
the role of AC has not been explored in animal models. Depending on pH, AC catalyzes either forward or reverse
reaction. Because primary lysosomal dysfunction and acidification impairment occurs AD, the increased pH
potentially promotes the reverse activity of AC, which would increase the stress lipid ceramide and promote
neuronal dysfunction. In this project we will test the hypothesis that acid ceramidase contributes to
neurodegeneration associated with Alzheimer’s Disease. In specific aim 1, we will generate PDAPP and 5xFAD
AD mice in which AC is deleted either in a neuron-specific or globally inducible manner. In specific Aim 2, we
will determine how loss of AC function affects AD pathology and behavior in PDAPP and 5xFAD models. The
use of neuron-specific and global AC deficient AD models will elucidate the role of the enzyme in neuronal cells
and clarify how loss of AC in other cells contributes to the disease. Understanding the role of AC in AD has the
potential for development of novel therapeutic strategies that combat this debilitating and costly disease."

Lung cancer remains both prevalent and deadly, emphasizing the need for continued research and therapy
development. Advances in immunotherapeutic technologies, including check-point inhibitors such as anti-PD-1
monoclonal antibody therapy, have shown great promise in treating lung cancer patients. Unfortunately, not all
patients respond. Recent clinical studies have linked anti-PD-1 therapy resistance with specific combinations of
somatic tumor mutations. Notably, patients with KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinomas lacking functional STK11
suffer a worse prognosis, increased rates of metastasis, and marked resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Why
STK11 loss of function (LoF) correlates with resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy remains unclear. Serine Threonine
Kinase 11 (STK11) encodes an important tumor suppressor gene frequently mutated in KRAS-driven lung
adenocarcinomas. Our work in human lung cancer cell lines supports STK11-loss-dependent transcriptional
induction of tumor cytokines as one mechanism that might impact anti-PD-1 therapy resistance. Specifically,
RNAseq analysis indicates activation of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFkB)
transcription networks occur upon STK11 loss. YAP1 is the ultimate effector in the HIPPO signaling axis, a
pathway critical for regulating organ size during development. While YAP1 has previously been linked with
regulating tumor cytokine expression, whether its activity is directly regulated by STK11 has yet to be established.
NFkB is a master transcription factor essential for regulating numerous cytokines, but as with YAP1, how STK11
might regulate NFkB activity remains unaddressed. We hypothesize that STK11 loss leads to anti-PD-1 therapy
resistance by altering immune cell recruitment to the tumor microenvironment via altered tumor cytokine
signaling. The workplan we present aims to characterize differential immune cell recruitment in an inducible
mouse model of lung cancer as a function of STK11 status and tumor transcriptome. We will leverage immune
competent, genetically engineered mice that develop inducible KRAS-driven or KRAS/STK11 LoF lung
adenocarcinomas to directly characterize the correlation between tumor genotype, tumor transcriptome, and
differential immune cell recruitment. We will then utilize this model to assess strategies for reversing anti-PD-1
therapy resistance. Specifically, we will evaluate antagonizing candidate transcriptional networks downstream of
STK11 loss, including YAP1 and NFkB, as strategies to restore an anti-tumor immune microenvironment,
potentially rescuing anti-PD1 efficacy in STK11 null tumors. To accomplish this, we will define the extent of
STK11-dependent anti-PD-1 resistance displayed by our mice compared with tumors driven by KRAS alone. We
will then evaluate whether antagonizing candidate networks reverses the STK11-LoF transcriptional phenotype,
and in turn restores the immune cell compliment observed in STK11 WT tumors."
10814863,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor with about
8500 cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Within a time frame of roughly
one year almost all patients succumb to this detrimental disease despite treatment.
Therefore, novel, ideally tumor specific approaches are necessary to combat these
tumors. Akin to other malignancies, GBMs depend on aerobic glycolysis, meaning that
paradoxically glucose is metabolized to lactate in the presence of an abundance of
molecular oxygen (Warburg-effect). Based on a chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing and transcriptome analysis, we found that HDAC-inhibition through
panobinostat, vorinostat and FK228 results in reprogramming of metabolism in stem-like
and established GBM cells, which is orchestrated in part by the modulation of three key
transcription factors. This leads to a significant reduction of glycolysis (reversal of the
Warburg effect) with lower overall ATP levels. HDAC treated GBM cells reactivate
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Consistently, interference with mitochondrial
translation or ATP production enhanced apoptosis in stem-like glioma and patient
derived xenograft (PDX) cells. To fuel OXPHOS, HDAC treated glioblastoma cells
increased the levels of transporters and enzymes related to fatty acid oxidation (FAO)
and pharmacological inhibition of FAO by the clinically validated compound, Etomoxir,
synergistically induced apoptosis in PDX, stem-like and established glioblastoma cells in
vitro as well as in PDX models in vivo. Overall, this research will enhance our
understanding about the treatment of brain tumors and may potentially allow us to
formulate a novel treatment strategy for glioblastomas and other gliomas."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with chronic hemolysis, systemic endothelial dysfunction,
inflammation and vascular occlusion. This complex pathophysiology leads to severe pain,
progressive multi-organ damage and premature death with a median lifespan of 48 years in high-
income countries. We and others have determined that young adults with progressive heart, lung,
and kidney damage, either individually or in combination, are at particularly high risk for premature
death. Many individuals with SCD are candidates for high-risk treatments that can potentially
eliminate symptoms and arrest organ damage, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
(HSC) transplantation and various forms of autologous HSC gene therapy. However, several
individuals who received these treatments have developed acute myeloid leukemia or other
myeloid neoplasms. In many cases, the blood cancer arose from an autologous, premalignant
HSC harboring a somatic “clonal hematopoiesis” (CH) mutation that was present before therapy.
We and others have shown in individuals without SCD that CH mutations confer a growth
advantage to aging HSCs, predisposing to not only myeloid leukemia, but also endovascular
disease affecting the heart, lung and kidney. Additional preliminary data derived from deidentified
genomic or exonic sequences indicate that individuals with SCD develop CH at earlier ages than
that of the general population. Based on these data, we hypothesize that individuals with SCD
have an increased prevalence of CH, which accelerates the development of heart, lung,
and kidney disease. We will test this hypothesis by first determining the prevalence and
incidence of CH in three well-characterized multi-center cohorts of older children and adults with
SCD (n= 2645) and matched controls (n= 7935, Aim 1). We will use a novel, scalable, cost-
effective, error-corrected sequencing assay that can detect low-level (0.1%) somatic CH
mutations. Next, we will determine whether CH mutations are associated with heart, lung or
kidney disease in these cohorts (Aim 2). Our team has already completed whole-genome
sequencing of the cohorts through the NIH NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)
program, which will allow us to study genetic interactions between CH mutations and germline
variants that are known to influence SCD outcomes. Our project will provide novel insights into
the importance of CH as a risk factor for heart, lung, and kidney disease in SCD, identify
individuals who could benefit from individualized strategies for organ protection administered
prospectively, and fuel future studies to determine whether CH predisposes to the development
of myeloid leukemia after allogeneic HSC transplantation or gene therapy for SCD."

Energy intake (EI) plays a critical role in the etiology and prevention of prevalent and debilitating chronic
diseases such as overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes. Self-monitoring is the cornerstone of the self-
regulation approach for reducing EI, but prevailing methods are burdensome and inaccurate which limits our
ability to understand eating patterns and intervene on them to improve health. There is a clear need for
innovative solutions that can unobtrusively monitor and reliably estimate EI in the context of daily life. For 10+
years, our group has researched the utility of a wrist-watch device (e.g., smartwatch) to passively monitor
eating behavior by measuring the acceleration and rotation of dominant-hand wrist motion of food being
brought to the mouth. Through several studies we have refined our approach for using patterns of wrist motion
to identify individual intake gestures (""bite"" of food, ""drink"" of beverage) during meals/snacks. We have shown
that we can use intake gesture count to estimate meal-level EI by using advanced modeling to estimate
kilocalories per bite (KPB) and kilocalories per drink (KPD) (e.g., EI = #bites x KPB + #drinks x KPD). We are
on the cusp of making this approach widely available for clinical application, but our latest advances in sensor-
based EI estimation require validation before the method is truly viable in real-world settings. In this project we
will definitively address 3 final barriers: 1) Our approach must be validated across settings and among a highly
representative sample; 2) Our models that use intake gestures to estimate EI must account for varying
contexts, such as different types of foods or food sources, that could influence EI; and 3) We must maximize
acceptability of the measurement methods. The proposed study will validate our sensor-based EI estimation
methods among a diverse sample, across three settings (cafeteria, home-based, and free-living), incorporating
minimal user input on foods and beverages (e.g., high energy density foods, zero calorie beverages) and
contexts (e.g., food source, time of day), and using two different sensors (commercial smartwatch and smart
ring). We will conduct two controlled data collections in which a single meal is video recorded while participants
wear the smartwatch and smart ring: N=300 in a cafeteria and N=240 in participant homes. All participants
(N=540) will then wear both devices and complete remote food photography during 4 days of everyday life
(free living). We will evaluate sensor-based estimates of EI against ground truth captured using video (cafeteria
and home) and remote food photography method (free-living). We will use our findings to create a practical
platform to guide researchers/clinicians implementing a sensor-based EI self-monitoring protocol that
maximizes accuracy and acceptability (selecting wrist vs. ring sensor, type of user input, and length of self-
monitoring). Our platform will ultimately support work in precision nutrition by transforming how we develop and
evaluate health-related interventions, and ultimately improve the quality of interventions targeting EI."
10835016,"Environmental pollutants can contribute to the unresolved or impaired resolution of inflammation which
is one of the critical mechanisms for developing chronic diseases. Cadmium (Cd), an environmental pollutant, is
one of the top ten hazardous chemical pollutants that negatively impacts human health and increases the burden
of disease. One real-life example of environmental Cd pollution-related negative health impacts is the North
Birmingham Superfund site. It is established that Superfund Site at N. Birmingham has high environmental Cd
contamination due to being near coke and steel plants in the area. Our laboratory is associated with the
Superfund Research Center at UAB and works closely with the community at the Birmingham Superfund Site.
In our research with the biological samples from the superfund site community, we have found that residents
from Superfund Site (Affected Area) have two times more incidence of chronic airway diseases. Environmental
exposure to Cd can induce dysregulated resolution pathways related to persistent inflammation which can be
one of the reasons for the increased incidences of airway diseases. The lung tissue and AMs from these
residents demonstrate higher levels of Cd than normal levels. The macrophages also demonstrated decreased
efferocytosis ability, presence of increased PAD4 and citrullinated CaMKII. We will be investigating Cd toxicity
mediated effects of PAD4 related downstream pathways for the impaired efferocytosis and airway remodeling.
We have 3 specific aims to test our hypothesis that Cd inhibits efferocytosis by AMs through PAD4 which leads
to continued inflammation and airway remodeling. Our specific aims are: (1) determine the mechanisms of Cd
induced PAD4 activity on efferocytosis by AMs in vitro and determine the impact of AMs with dysfunctional
efferocytosis previously described 3D ex-vivo pulmospheres model. (2) Determine if Cd exposure mediated
PAD4 dependent dysfunctional efferocytosis is associated with airway disease in vivo. (3) Determine if
association of environmental exposure of Cd and decreased efferocytosis, and lung function in the residents
from North Birmingham Superfund Site."

The goal of this proposal is to characterize the evolution of changes in neuronal activity and connectivity that
occur within and across nodal points in the basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit using a progressive
nonhuman primate (NHP) model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Simultaneous recordings from populations of
neurons as well as local field potential (LFP) activity will be made from the basal ganglia, motor and sensory
thalamus, primary motor (MC) and sensory cortex (S1) as well as dorsal premotor (PMd), supplementary motor
area (SMA) and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortices in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
(MPTP) progressive model of PD. Data will be collected during both rest and movement, on and off L-dopa and
on L-dopa during drug-induced dyskinesia. A within-subject design will be used as animals progress from the
normal to mild, moderate and severe conditions of parkinsonism. Specific Aim 1 will characterize changes in
coupling and connectivity that occur between the subthalamic nucleus, internal and external segments of the
globus pallidus, motor thalamus (ventralis anterior (VA), ventralis lateralis, pars oralis (VLo), ventralis posterior
lateralis, pars oralis (VPLo), and cortical areas involved in the planning, preparation and execution of movement
(PMd, DLPFC, SMA, and MC). Specific Aim 2 will examine the effect of dopaminergic therapy (L-dopa) on
subcortical↔cortical connectivity and the relationship of these changes to improvement in motor signs and the
development of L-dopa induced dyskinesia (LID). Specific Aim 3 will characterize the changes and contribution
of altered sensorimotor processing in thalamo↔cortical and cortical↔cortical circuits (MC-S1). This proposal will
define the relationship between changes in synchronized oscillatory activity in, and effective connectivity
between, subcortical↔cortical and cortical↔cortical regions of the broader BGTC network to parkinsonian motor
signs as they develop, progress in severity, and improve with L-dopa. It will also characterize the role of changes
in different frequency spectrums to the preparation, planning and execution of movement, as well as the
contribution of sensory dysfunction in thalamocortical circuits to the motor dysfunction observed in PD. A better
understanding of the role of individual motor circuits and the types of physiological changes that occur within
these circuits and how they relate to the development of individual motor signs will provide the rationale for the
development of new targets and neuromodulation therapies directed at restoring a more normal pattern of activity
in the BGTC circuit."

Adult smoking prevalence in the United States (US) is approximately 14% nationwide, yet significant disparities
persist, including among adults with annual household incomes <$35,000 (21.3%), Medicaid recipients
(23.9%), and the uninsured (23.9%). These populations are also less likely to receive smoking cessation
assistance and to use evidence-based cessation interventions. Many public health agendas emphasize
addressing these inequalities to reduce smoking related morbidity and mortality. To do this, we need to
increase accessibility to cessation services among these populations. Community health centers (CHCs) are
ideal settings to reach smokers who are socioeconomically disadvantaged as they provide care to 29 million
patients, the majority of whom are uninsured or publicly insured. Integrating Quitline referrals into these
settings has the potential to reach a large number of smokers. Bidirectional eReferral systems, which allow
providers to send a referral directly to the Quitline from the electronic health record (EHR) and Quitlines to
send information about the patient's disposition back into the patient's individual EHR, provide a platform for
more efficient and standardized referral systems. This method has increasedQuitline reach compared to faxed
orindirect referral methods; however,the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's goal for Quitlines to
reach 8% of all tobacco users annually has not been met. A critical knowledge gap exists in how best to
implement Quitline eReferral systems into health care settings to maximize the reach and effectiveness of
cessation services. Enhanced academic detailing, which includes educational outreach and performance audit
and feedback, can increase the use of best practices and the uptake of new processes and procedures among
health care providers; however, in-person and ongoing enhanced academic detailing is infrequently used for
Quitline referral implementation. Almost half of all US states report no staff training related to their provider
referral programs. This cluster-randomized trial will recruit 30 Oregon CHCs (n~15,000 patients who smoke).
Half of the clinics will be randomized to receive the Quitline eReferral system with enhanced academic
detailing (intervention condition; n=15 clinics) and half to receive the Quitline eReferral system without
enhanced academic detailing (comparison condition; n=15 clinics). This pragmatic trial will use EHR and
Quitline data to assess rates of smoking cessation assistance reach and effectiveness among patients in the
intervention clinics compared with rates among patients in the comparison clinics. We will also evaluate the

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the US. Although the over-
all incidence is declining, the incidence in the younger population has been steadily increasing over the past
thirty years. While a western diet and a sedentary lifestyle are among contributing environmental factors to early
onset colorectal cancer (EOCRC; as defined in individuals <50 years old), genetic research has also implicated
the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway as a driver of EOCRC. Mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)
gene, which is a tumor suppressor and encodes a negative regulatory protein of the pathway, are highly prevalent
in spontaneous CRC. These mutations drive an oncogenic gene expression program controlled by the ß-catenin
transcriptional co-regulator. APC mutations, and other regulators of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling, are also found in
EOCRC tumor samples, but the role of deregulated Wnt/ß-catenin signaling in EOCRC is not understood. The
goals of this proposal are to elucidate critical downstream Wnt/ß-catenin gene targets and to identify novel Wnt-
pathway modulators that drive EOCRC. In Aim 1, we will use RNA-seq to define differential gene expression
signatures in patient-matched colonic segments and tumors. We will focus on known downstream target genes
of Wnt/ß-catenin signaling and test their role(s) in driving EOCRC using human-derived tumoroids. In Aim 2, we
will use a CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen to identify novel proteins that negatively regulate Wnt/ß-catenin
signaling in human colonic organoid cultures derived from EOCRC patients. This work will identify novel drivers
of EOCRC which is needed to better understand disease pathogenesis and to reveal new avenues for potential
therapeutic intervention."

 In the anterior eye, the precorneal tear film (PCTF) acts as the interface between the ocular surface and
external environment and plays a critical role in maintaining ocular surface homeostasis. In dry eye disease
(DED), the PCTF becomes thinner, and destabilizes (evaporates) rapidly leading to hyperosmolarity,
inflammation, and ocular surface desiccation. In 2020, the National Eye Institute (NEI) released a Notice of
Special Interest (NOSI) for the Anterior Segment Initiative (ASI), “Identification and Development of New
Biomarkers and Effective Methods to Diagnose Dry Eye Disease.” The notice highlighted a critical need for
biomarkers and methods to diagnose DED prior to the onset of symptoms. The overall goal of this proposal is to
characterize microstructural thickness variations of the tear film lipid layer (TFLL) and their association with
clinical characteristics of DED. TFLL, the outmost layer of PCTF, overlies the aqueous phase, and serves as the
barrier against evaporative aqueous loss, and stabilize it by facilitating the spread of its aqueous compartment
and reducing surface tension. However, the exact mechanism by which the TFLL retards tear evaporation and
promotes PCTF stability remains poorly understood. For instance, while most would agree that a uniform and
thicker TFLL would be more protective against evaporation, and therefore prevent DED, this relationship remains
controversial in the literature; resolution of this controversy forms the basis of this proposal. Under a NIH/NEI
grant in 2021(R21EY033029), we constructed a novel laser source point-scanning interferometer that enables
the in vivo assessment of dynamics of PCTF and related structures of TFLL with unprecedented resolution and
sensitivity. Using this powerful system, we propose to address critical yet previously unexplored and often
inconsistent associations between TFLL and examination findings of PCTF. The central hypothesis of the
proposed research is that thickness variations in the microstructure of TFLL are associated with clinical
characteristics of DED. We will test this hypothesis in concurrent Specific Aims: Aim 1: Verify and quantify the
inversely relationship between TFLL thickness and PCTF evaporation rate. We hypothesize that TFLL thickness
is inversely proportional to PCTF evaporation, with “thin” regions of the TFLL allowing excessive loss of aqueous
tears. Aim 2: Quantify the impact of TFLL thickness variations on PCTF instability. We hypothesize that steep
stress gradients at the interface between “thin” and “thick” regions of the TFLL cause PCTF instability.
 Collectively, the proposed studies will introduce two new parameters to characterize the lipid layer
microstructure and correlate them with PCTF evaporation and instability, which will be tested and validated with
our novel high-resolution interferometric system. With further clinical validation, these parameters will allow for
early, non-invasive assessment of DED and inform the development of new therapeutics to slow or prevent the
development of DED."

This submission represents a collaborative application from Maureen Murphy PhD at the Wistar Institute in
Philadelphia and Kara Maxwell MD/PhD from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.
The goal is to study the function of a novel p53 mutation that was first discovered in several highly cancer-
prone families seen in Dr. Maxwell’s clinic at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. This variant,
G334R in p53 protein (G331R in mouse p53) was found in nine different families with multiple cancers in
multiple generations, including cousins with pediatric adrenal tumors; the latter are a hallmark of cancer-
predisposing mutations in TP53. Moreover, we find that several tumors from these patients show loss of
heterozygosity for p53. We show that the G334R variant is impaired for oligomerization, and for the induction
of a small subset of p53 target genes, several of which are themselves tumor suppressors (PCLO, PLXNB3,
and others).
Our functional analyses of the G334R variant suggest that this is not a traditional Li Fraumeni mutant; that is,
a mutation that completely inactivates p53 function. Rather, our functional data are most consistent with
G334R being a p53 “hypomorph”, or a genetic variant that shows impaired, but not completely inactive,
function. Specifically, 1) G334R possesses some ability to suppress colony formation in tumor cells, though
it shows less ability than wild type p53; 2) G334R is fully capable of transactivating the overwhelming majority
of p53-regulated genes, but is defective in the transactivation of approximately two dozen p53 target genes;
3) the peak incidence for breast cancer in G334R individuals is between the ages of 35-55, while most cases
of Li Fraumeni occur between the ages of 20-40, and sporadic breast cancer peaks between the ages of 55-
75.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the mechanism(s) whereby G334R is impaired for function.
In a completely unexpected finding, we show that there are some activities of the G334R hypomorph that are
shared with two other cancer-predisposing p53 hypomorphs, P47S and Y107H. These activities include a
heightened propensity to misfold into a conformation that is specific for mutant p53, as well as increased
sensitivity to glutaminase inhibitors. We also show that using RNA sequencing data and machine learning
approaches, we have identified a 42-gene signature that is predictive of a p53 hypomorph, and can distinguish
a p53 hypomorph from WT p53 or a benign variant with 100% accuracy. The proposed research will help us
better understand tumor suppression by p53, and to identify other carriers of hypomorphic genetic variants of
p53."

Per 2019 Alzheimer’s report, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dire statistics include: a current patient load of
5.8 million that is projected to expand to 14 million by 2050 in the US, increases in deaths by 145% (per
2000-2017 data), and climbing healthcare costs - $290 billion in 2019. In terms of pharmacotherapy, five
clinical drugs [i.e., three cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), one N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist
(NMDRA), and one ChEI/NMDRA combo-drug] are indicated for AD and these drugs only provide
symptomatic relief - they do not slow disease progression. A triad of poor health outcomes, lack of
effective drugs, and high failure rates of pipeline molecules in clinical trials has therefore increased the
urgency to discover more robust anti-AD molecules with novel mechanisms for slowing disease
progression. The overall objective of this grant application is to 1) synthesize derivatives of Tubastatin A
(a highly selective HDA6 inhibitor, IC50 = 15 nM), 2) evaluate each derivative for binding/functional
activities at individual sigma (σ) receptors, and 3) determine each compound’s ability to inhibit histone
deacetylase-6 (HDAC6). Central hypothesis: single molecules designed using the multi-target-directed
ligands (MTDL) paradigm could more effectively mitigate AD’s neurodegenerative pathogenic cascades
and repair cognitive deficits. Evidently, in AD animal models, independent σ-1 activation or σ-2
blockade or HDAC6 inhibition commonly result in decreased neurodegeneration and improved cognitive
function. Therefore, our synthesized derivatives are expected to exhibit a de-novo σ-1/HDAC6 or σ-
2/HDAC6 combo-mechanistic anti-neurodegenerative approach towards slowing AD progression or
potentially modifying the disease."

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness. Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is the 
only modifiable target for intervention, but the mechanisms causing elevated IOP remain poorly 
understood. This proposal builds on our studies of oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe, a rare 
X-linked disease that presents with congenital glaucoma, the major cause of blindness in these 
children. OCRL is an inositol phosphatase mutated in Lowe syndrome. This application seeks to 
restore the phosphoinositide imbalance that underlies Lowe syndrome by targeting inositol-signaling 
pathways. We have found evidence that restoring phosphoinositide levels in trabecular meshwork 
cells can rescue the disease in a Lowe mouse model. We have identified patients with Lowe syndrome 
who are born with congenital glaucoma and have characterized their mutations. We also discovered 
mTOR signaling defects in these patients. Thus, we hypothesize that modulation of phosphoinositide 
signaling in the trabecular meshwork will restore aqueous outflow. Our aims are to (1) restore 
aqueous outflow by viral delivery of OCRL, (2) balance excess PI(4,5)P2 by inhibiting upstream 
kinase, (3) modulate mTOR signaling in both the mouse model and a human iPSC model of Lowe 
syndrome. Our work should help determine the role of OCRL in aqueous outflow regulation. Since 
phosphoinositide signaling is a novel area of IOP control, the experiments should facilitate 
discovery of new glaucoma therapies that can reduce the burden of blindness."

The Imaging Core will provide comprehensive support for the in vivo imaging studies within the PPG projects.
The core will be operated at the BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute (BMEII) at Mount Sinai under
the direction of Core Director Dr. Philip Robson (Mount Sinai). Other members of this core will include
dedicated image analysts, data managers, and other coordinating support staff at Mount Sinai. The Imaging
Core will consist of an expert panel to incorporate expertise across all program project areas. The panel will
review imaging and data analysis protocols at inception and periodically during the projects to optimize and
update protocols employed in the program. Leveraging the existing experience, expertise, and infrastructures
of the current ongoing Program Project and Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at BMEII, a group dedicated to operating
imaging-based clinical-trial-like research studies for intra-mural, extra-mural, and industrial collaborators, the
core members will assist with the technical imaging protocol development and implementation as well as
supervise image analysis for all Projects. In addition, the core will also serve as the image and data repository
for imaging data obtained from this Program Project Grant (PPG). The Imaging Core will also fulfill the role of
an “academic research organization” (an activity we have a substantial amount of experience in) for the two-
center human clinical trial proposed in Project 4 and be responsible for the validation of all systems used for
imaging and analysis, tracking data flow including maintaining an audit trail, operational management of the
trial and ensuring compliance with all federal and regulatory guidelines. Finally, the Imaging Core will be
responsible for centralized management of all the imaging data acquired as part of this PPG."
10867320,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 The splicing of mRNA is a complex biological process that enormously enhances the
diversity of proteins within a limited set of protein-coding genes in the cell. While integral for
normal function, errors in splicing can occur and lead to various diseases including muscular
dystrophy, Alzheimer's disease, parkinsonism, cardiovascular disease, ataxias and cancers.
Splicing relies on essential factors known as SR proteins that bind precursor mRNA and then
selectively incorporate other protein/RNA elements ultimately leading to a macromolecular
machine known as the spliceosome that performs the necessary excision of certain non-coding
elements. The SRPKs are a family of protein kinases that phosphorylate and direct SR
proteins to the nucleus where they participate in these essential splicing functions. Although
much is known about SRPK function in the cytoplasm, less is known about their role in the
nucleus. Furthermore, although SRPKs are best known for their role in splicing, we showed
recently that SRPK1 phosphorylates protamines, thereby regulating protamine-to-histone
exchange on the paternal genome upon fertilization. We will investigate how SRPK1 forms a
complex with a second protein kinase in the nucleus to activate the phosphorylation and
release of SR proteins and the U1 snRNP component U1-70K for splicing function. We will
also explore how SRPK1 uses a novel recognition mechanism compared to SR proteins to
phosphorylate protamines and induce DNA phase transitions and genomic decondensation
necessary for oocyte development. These studies will involve a broad range of biophysical
and biological techniques including mass spectrometry, molecular and cell biology, enzyme
kinetics, and confocal microscopy. Overall, the experiments outlined in this proposal will
address the key functions of the protein kinase SRPK1 in controlling protein diversity as well
as at the earliest stages of life."

Women of color have higher rates of poor pregnancy outcomes than non-Hispanic whites in the U.S. For
example, the prevalence of preterm birth is 14.4%, 10.0% and 9.3% among Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic
white mothers, respectively. Hispanic and Black women are also at higher risk of maternal morbidities such as
hypertension in pregnancy and gestational diabetes. Along with the compelling evidence of the impact of adverse
perinatal health on the health of a mother and her infant throughout the life course comes high societal and
economic costs. Yet, the etiology of adverse pregnancy outcomes among women of color is not fully explained
by genetics, behavior, or access to care and other factors, including structural racism, likely play a role.
Historically, communities of color have been, and continue to be, burdened by downstream effects of redlining
practices, including housing discrimination and neighborhood segregation. Given the proximity of their
neighborhoods to key sources of air, water, and soil pollution (another consequence of redlining), communities
of color also experience environmental racism, i.e., a disproportionate burden of environmental exposures.
Moreover, women in high-risk communities are subject to spillover stress from disproportionate policing, police
violence, arrests, and incarceration. While there is growing evidence of the impact of structural racism on
perinatal health, findings are equivocal, and research related to the joint impact of multiple forms of structural
racism is lacking. In this application, we will assess the independent effects of structural racism across multiple
domains on racial/ethnic disparities in both maternal morbidity (hypertension in pregnancy and gestational
diabetes) and adverse pregnancy outcomes (low birth weight and preterm birth), explore whether combined
exposures to multiple domains of structural racism enhance disparities, and apply machine learning methods to
identify the key structural racism predictors of adverse perinatal health outcomes. To achieve our aims, we will
construct a retrospective birth cohort of women who delivered infants at major obstetric hospitals in the 3rd largest
county (Harris) in the U.S. (where Houston is located) that will include follow-up throughout a mother’s pregnancy
to the birth of her infant. Our project leverages established partnerships among Baylor College of Medicine,
UTHealth McGovern Medical School, and Texas Southern University through our NIMHD/NIEHS/NICHD P50
Center of Excellence on Environmental Health Disparities Research, focused on reducing environmental health
disparities in maternal and child health, and draws on our collective expertise in environmental and perinatal
epidemiology, women’s health, maternal-fetal medicine, criminal justice, social science, biostatistics, and
bioinformatics. This work is expected to elucidate the contribution of structural racism across multiple domains
on racial/ethnic disparities in several key perinatal health outcomes. Importantly, the results from this study will
also enhance our understanding of the complex interplay and identification of key structural racism drivers of
perinatal health disparities and lay the foundation for future studies to promote interventions."
10815742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury (SCI) newly afflicts 18,000 Americans/year and has devastating effects on body function and
mental health. Initial spinal cord trauma elicits a delayed cascade of damage (“secondary damage”) that is driven
by a harmful inflammatory response. This delayed damage is a window for acute intervention, yet there are no
effective neuroprotective SCI therapies. Immune activation is broadly regulated by the circadian system, which
optimizes across-day physiologic activities. Importantly, pivotal circadian factors act as transcriptional regulators
that govern the circadian clock – but also control crucial processes in the body, such as immune reactivity. There
is a critical need to illuminate novel approaches for treating SCI, such as modulating the circadian-neuroimmune
axis, that could ameliorate anatomical and behavioral deficits. One promising circadian protein, REV-ERB, is a
transcriptional repressor that dampens reactivity of innate immune cells, including central nervous system mi-
croglia and peripheral macrophages. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish whether REV-ERB is
a circadian-neuroimmune repressor that can be targeted to improve neuroprotection and neurologic function
after SCI. Past studies show that SCI perturbs epicenter circadian rhythms, which likely enables excess inflam-
mation. Preliminary data reveal that activating REV-ERB reduces macrophage reactivity and boosts locomotor
recovery after SCI. Therefore, this proposal is important, as identifying new protective targets will help ameliorate
secondary damage and deficits after SCI. This proposal’s central hypothesis is that amplifying REV-ERB activa-
tion will improve neuroprotection, locomotor function, pain relief, and mood after SCI. The rationale is that re-
pressing harmful inflammatory transcriptional programs after SCI by boosting REV-ERBs will lead to neuropro-
tection, which would have implications for SCI therapies. This proposal addresses these Specific Aims: 1) Reveal
whether microglial and/or macrophage REV-ERBs are required to limit neurotoxic and neurologic detriments
after SCI; 2) Establish whether CNS macrophage-targeted REV-ERB overexpression improves tissue sparing
and neurologic recovery after SCI; and 3) Determine whether pharmacologic REV-ERB activation benefits in-
flammatory cell state to boost neuroprotection and SCI recovery. For the first time, this proposal combines field-
specific SCI and circadian-neuroimmune methods, including anatomical and molecular analysis of epicenter;
motor, pain, and mood-related behaviors; cell culture; and cutting-edge single-cell RNA-sequencing. Thus, the
proposed research is innovative, as it links unique ideas, expertise, and methods in SCI, circadian rhythms, and
neuroinflammation. This contribution will be significant: it will reveal the broad, clinically relevant role of optimizing
neuroimmune reactivity for improving neuroprotection – and for promoting locomotor recovery, pain relief, and
mental health – after SCI. Ultimately, this knowledge could inform development and implementation of novel
therapies for improving recovery and quality of life for those with SCI."

Growth impairment is a common complication of pediatric Crohn’s disease. Normalization of
growth is a marker of disease control and successful Crohn’s disease therapy. Treatment
strategies for improving growth impairment and final adult height are currently suboptimal. The
impact of Crohn’s disease on growth is potentially mediated by many factors, including
inflammation, genetics, microbiome, nutrition, and medications. The continued presence of
growth impairment primarily reflects continued suboptimal treatment of the underlying
inflammation characteristic of Crohn’s disease. We hypothesize that the inflammation
characteristic of Crohn’s disease has greater negative effects on endocrine growth regulators
(IGF-1 levels, sex hormone levels, and gonadotropin levels) in males and that these greater
negative inflammatory effects help to explain the increased susceptibility to growth impairment
in males. This hypothesis is based on our analyses of data collected from our completed
prospective multicenter longitudinal study of sex differences in growth impairment (Growth
Study Part 1). Our Part 1 data show that as bone age progresses, standardized height gain is
lower in males. Our Part 1 findings suggest inflammation exerts a greater negative effect on
hormone levels and growth in males, and indicate that sex-specific molecular pathways lead to
growth impairment in children with Crohn’s disease. The primary pathway to growth impairment
appears be the growth hormone/IGF-1 axis in males and the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis
in females. Developing a sex-specific risk-based treatment approach for children with Crohn’s
disease is essential. However, the specific molecular mechanisms causing sex differences in
growth impairment remain poorly characterized. Here, we propose to expand and continue to
follow our cohort to harvest information on the proteome (Aim 1) and genome (Aim 2) to provide
new insights into growth impairment. These data will enhance our ability to determine the
underlying mechanisms of sex differences in growth impairment (Aims 1 and 2) and develop
robust sex-specific predictive models to identify high-risk patients (Aim 3). Part 2 of the Growth
Study will generate essential data that will enable us to develop a highly needed sex-specific
risk- based pediatric Crohn’s disease treatment approach, which will represent a major
paradigm shift in clinical practice. Institution of appropriate personalized sex-specific risk-based
medical therapies targeting the underlying inflammation (since improved growth results from
improved disease control) is essential since only a very narrow therapeutic interval is available
to intervene to improve growth before growth plates close."

ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that includes attention difficulty, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity. The diagnosis is associated with many challenges to educational, occupational, and health
outcomes, particularly when untreated. Genetic studies of ADHD have the potential to clarify the disorder’s
biological underpinnings, its heterogeneity, and its relationship to other neuropsychiatric diagnoses. However,
genetic research into ADHD lags in terms of: (1) sample size, (2) ancestral diversity, and (3) consideration of
phenotypic heterogeneity. Akili is designed to address all three of these critical gaps. Akili (the Swahili term for
“mind”) will enroll 6,000 children in Kenya and South Africa – 4,000 with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and
2,000 age- and ancestry-matched controls. All participants will complete a detailed behavioral, cognitive, and
medical phenotyping battery, and provide a DNA sample. We will genetically characterize all 6,000 participants
using exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping, and make all Akili data and materials publicly
available through the NIMH. Akili data will nearly double the number of ADHD cases available for exome
sequencing analysis and provide a 20% addition to the current PGC-ADHD GWAS activity. It will be by far the
largest contributor of diverse ancestry data to either analysis. Akili will generate a research resource of
international value, and provide the first large-scale characterization of ADHD in the African context."
10869935,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a debilitating atherosclerotic disease caused by plaque development in the
arteries leading to diminished skeletal muscle blood flow, oxygen delivery, and metabolic dysfunction during
ambulation causing marked exercise intolerance. Veterans have a disproportionate risk of developing PAD
compared to the general population because of higher levels of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity.
Worryingly, the mortality rate for PAD in Veterans (~30%) is nearly double that of the general population.
Currently, the best treatment of PAD is exercise rehabilitation, however, issues with patient motivation and pain
reduce the effectiveness of this treatment. There is a pressing, and unmet need to identify the sites and
underlying mechanisms of the systemic dysfunction leading to exercise intolerance induced by PAD. Oxidative
stress and inflammation play important roles in the development and progression of PAD. Critically, the
peripheral vasculature (diminished blood flow) and mitochondria (diminished respiration) are primary
determinants/mechanisms responsible for exercise intolerance in health and disease that are particularly
vulnerable to elevations in oxidative stress and inflammation, making these likely sites of systemic dysfunction
leading to exercise intolerance in Veterans with PAD. Any vascular or mitochondrial dysfunction would further
augment oxidative stress and inflammation initiating a vicious cycle. It is our central hypothesis that increased
endogenous antioxidant capacity and diminished inflammation will improve oxygen delivery and utilization during
exercise, thus, increasing the efficacy of exercise rehabilitation due to increased adherence and exercise
capacity. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize the naturally-derived Nuclear Factor Erythroid-2-like 2 (Nrf2; the
“master regulator of antioxidant enzymes”) activator, PB125, to stimulate induction of endogenous antioxidants
and decrease the activity of inflammatory pathways. Veterans with PAD will be randomly assigned to receive
either PB125 or Placebo supplementation. Each Veteran will undergo three phases of testing: 1) baseline, 2)
post 1 month of supplement loading, and 3) post 12 weeks of exercise rehabilitation with continued
supplementation. Functional capacity and cognitive function (Aim 1), Vascular function and exercising
hemodynamics (Aim 2), and in vivo and ex vivo mitochondrial respiration (Aim 3) will be assessed each phase.
Monthly assessments of functional capacity, behavioral regulation, quality of life, and physical activity will track
improvements across the trial. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have expanded our knowledge of the
mechanisms underlying exercise intolerance in Veterans suffering from PAD, and, more importantly from a
clinical perspective, provided insight into a potential novel therapeutic treatment to improve exercise
rehabilitation efficacy for this population. It is anticipated this advancement will contribute to advancing clinical
practice in rehabilitative medicine, and ultimately, improving the quality of life for Veterans living with PAD."
10811644,"Anticipated Impact on Veteran's Healthcare: PTSD is a critical obstacle to the recovery of Veterans with
serious mental illness (SMI; psychotic spectrum and bipolar disorders). The Veterans Health Administration
(VHA) has made treatment of PTSD a high priority and has initiated dissemination of evidence-based practices
(EBPs) for PTSD across the national VHA system. However, EBPs for PTSD have not been tested among, and
are largely not provided to Veterans living with both PTSD and SMI, despite high co-occurrence rates and
profound associated negative functional impact. This study will: [Aim 1) administer the Cultural Formulation
Interview (CFI) during a pre-pilot study of WET with 10 Veterans with SMI and PTSD to inform how best to incorporate
aspects of cultural identity into the WET intervention pilot-testing in Aim 2; Aim 2) conduct a pilot randomized controlled
trial (RCT) with 48 Veterans with SMI and PTSD to examine the feasibility and acceptability of WET, [monitor fidelity],
and preliminarily evaluate clinical and functional outcomes; Aim 3) complete a well-specified process evaluation to
determine what, if any, considerations are needed to optimize WET for Veterans with SMI and regarding
culturally responsive methods. Overall impact will be to move WET towards full evaluation as a potential EBP
for Veterans with PTSD and SMI.
Project Background: PTSD is prevalent among Veterans and others with SMI,3-8contributing to substantial
mental and physical health impairments.7,14-22 Written Exposure Therapy (WET) is a new EBP for PTSD that may
have special clinical utility for Veterans with SMI and PTSD. 31,41-42,44 However, such Veterans have been largely
excluded from PTSD clinical trials, and no WET trials to date have focused on an SMI population.42,45 Further,
there are significant race and ethnicity disparities in PTSD and SMI prevalence and treatment, even in VHA.2,47
For instance, persistence and chronicity of SMI and PTSD are higher for Black, Indigenous, and other people of
color (BIPOC),48,103 underlining the need for PTSD EBPs to be delivered in culturally responsive ways.
Project Objectives: The proposed CDA-2 research will address research and clinical gaps by integrating
culturally responsive assessment methods and testing the feasibility and acceptability of WET among Veterans
with SMI and PTSD. [The first step of this research will focus on administering culturally responsive assessments
and WET to Veterans with PTSD and SMI in a training trial (n = 10), including qualitative interviews exploring
participants' experiences with and views of these instruments and WET.] The second step will involve completing
a small randomized controlled trial of WET to examine feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of WET, and to
preliminary explore changes to clinical outcomes and functioning among 48 Veterans randomized to WET (n =
32) vs. a PTSD psychoeducation control intervention (n = 16). We will assess rates of recruitment, initial
intervention engagement, and session attendance (feasibility); Veteran satisfaction with WET (acceptability); and
preliminarily explore response to WET. The final step of this research will involve conducting a process evaluation
to consider ways to optimize WET for future clinical trials to improve functional recovery for Veterans with SMI.
This evaluation will synthesize information from: 1) WET interventionist notes and 2) qualitative interviews with
a subset of Veterans in the WET condition (n = 15).
Project Methods: This project will include: [1) delivering WET with the CFI during a training trial followed by
qualitative interviews with Veterans with PTSD and SMI;] 2) completing a randomized control trial (RCT) with 48
Veteran participants, monitoring fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability; and 3) studying Veterans' experiences of
WET and culturally responsive assessment methods through qualitative interviews. We will measure functional
outcomes during the RCT at baseline, post-treatment and 3-month follow-up using clinician-rated and self-report
questionnaires for preliminary exploratory analysis, preparatory to a future full RCT if WET proves promising."

Aggression is an evolutionarily conserved behavior that controls social hierarchies and protects valuable
resources like mates, food, and territory. In most cases, aggression is a necessary, adaptive component of
social behavior. In humans, however, some forms of aggression are considered pathological when they
threaten lives, increase the risk of psychiatric impairment in victims, and incur economic burdens on society.
Considerable evidence indicates that aggression is associated with aberrant facial perception in humans.
Physically aggressive individuals have a tendency to identify ambiguous faces as threatening or angry. This
suggests that these individuals have a perceptual bias which impairs the ability of the individual to interpret the
level of threat correctly. There is ample evidence in human and non-human primates that the amygdala plays a
key role in social perception. Studies with human and non-human primates examining the amygdala's role in
social perception have focused on the lateral and basolateral amygdala given their extensive connections with
the visual system and because they are a highly dependent on vision. Conversely, rodents are more reliant on
olfaction, and thus, we need a deeper understanding of amygdala interactions with olfactory structures during
social encounters. The posterior cortical amygdala (COAp) is one such region which receives input from
olfactory structures. Our preliminary data suggest that activation of ESR-1 cells in the COAp are necessary for
aggressive behavior to occur in males but not females. Furthermore, these cells show an increase in activity
during attack behavior in males. In addition to the expected input from the main olfactory bulb, we discovered
that this cell population also receives input from the ventral striatopallidal system, which is involved in
motivational processes. For the K99 phase of this proposal, I will test the hypothesis that the ventral
striatopallidal system affects the motivation to attack by modulating preparatory activity in the COAp. Over the
R00 phase, I will build a research program to test the hypothesis that the COAp mediates state-dependent
responses to social olfactory stimuli. In order to induce an “aggressive state” in mice we will use the social
instigation model. The results from this proposal will increase the field's understanding of how non-sensory
variables affect what are traditionally known as sensory regions. In addition, the proposed training will allow me
to develop a future research program geared towards identifying mechanisms underlying the effects of altered
behavioral states on perceptual processes."
10914092,"Shigella spp. are major enteric pathogens, causing acute diarrhea and bacillary dysentery leading to severe mortality and morbidity worldwide. Yet, there is no licensed vaccine to prevent shigellosis. Shigella virulence requires a T3SS and at least 30 secreted effectors that are often functionally redundant, yet required to invade host cells, maintain a replicative niche, minimize alarm signals, and promote colonization. We previously showed that S. flexneri T3SS activity is detected in macrophages by Caspase-1 inflammasomes, resulting in pyroptosis. In the recent mouse shigellosis model, the role of the inflammasome is only focused on gut intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, it is generally believed that Shigella initially infect macrophages and takes advantage of pyroptotic cell death to exit the cells and subsequently infect IECs. On the other hand, macrophage pyroptosis is known to generate pore-induced traps (PITs), trapping, and neutralizing intracellular bacterial pathogens. Since macrophages pyroptosis is considered to play dichotomous roles during Shigella infection, we propose to investigate the interaction between macrophages' inflammasomes and S. flexneri. We propose two specific Aims: In Aim1, we will investigate how pyroptotic macrophages from PITs trap intracellular bacteria. In Aim 2. We will define the role of pyroptotic macrophages and PITs during S. flexneri infection in vitro and in vivo. We hope that examining the role of macrophages pyroptosis against S. flexneri infection, will be highly significant and relevant for better understanding immunity and disease pathologies during Shigella infection and thereby providing the basis for developing novel safer, and more effective vaccines."

the well-being of women and their families. In sub-Saharan Africa, BC incidence is rising, late presentation is
common, younger women are disproportionately affected, and survival rates are low. One of the
Government of Ghana’s top strategies to combat BC is early detection through routine screening, yet
screening rates are low. Our multidisciplinary team has designed two interventions to surmount three key
sociocultural and economic barriers and increase the utilization of BC screening, including (1) time and
transportation costs, (2) cultural beliefs and stigma, and (3) male dominance in decision-making and lack of
social support for women. The BUNDLING intervention offers women BC and diabetes education followed
by BC and type II diabetes screenings during the same visit to the local clinic. Provision of simultaneous
(bundled) screenings is hypothesized to increase BC screening through several mechanisms, including
reducing time/transportation costs and diluting the stigma of seeking BC screening on its own. The MEGH
(Male Engagement in Gender and Health) Program offers BC education to women and their male partners,
invites partners to 7 weekly discussion group sessions (5 men-only and 2 women and men), and
subsequently offers women BC screening at the local clinic. The MEGH Program is hypothesized to increase
BC screening through several mechanisms, including changing men’s gender attitudes, increasing women’s
control over decision-making, and increasing men’s social support. Our long-term goal is to test the
effectiveness of these interventions in a future clustered RCT. The overall goal of the proposed R21 project
is to finalize the design and implementation aspects for the future RCT in a feasibility study. The specific
aims are: (1) Refine study materials (education materials, MEGH Program curriculum, data collection
instruments) for cultural relevance and implementation. We consult with an expert advisory committee and a
local committee in an iterative process. (2) Determine the feasibility of the two interventions using sequential
mixed methods. We assess the interventions in three clinic zones (2 interventions + a control) with women
age 20+ (and male partners in the MEGH group). We conduct baseline and endline surveys, followed by
qualitative in-depth interviews. (2A) Establish feasibility based on recruitment, retention, and acceptability.
(2B) Assess initial evidence of efficacy and intervention fidelity, and clarify these findings through
participants’ insights from follow-on in-depth interviews. We assess the strengths and weaknesses of the
interventions, challenges to intervention fidelity, and implementation approaches. (2C) Examine initial
evidence of the effect of interventions on the mechanisms, and clarify these findings through participants’
insights. (2D) Finalize the protocol for the future clustered RCT using study findings. These new
interventions tackle key barriers to improving a critical health behavior—BC screening—for women. The
study will generate a prototype for addressing the high incidence of BC in low-income settings."

We demonstrated that short-term fasting protects mice from high dose ionizing radiation by protecting small
intestinal (SI) stem cells, thereby preserving SI homeostasis and promoting organismal survival. We also
showed that the major ketone body produced by fasting directly modifies the epigenome of SI epithelial cells to
induce gene expression changes and that fasting alters the gut microbiome to favor bacteria whose
metabolites are known to induce epigenetic and gene expression changes. We will test the hypothesis that
ketone bodies and microbial metabolites induced by fasting, cause epigenetic and gene expression changes in
SI epithelial cells thereby providing GI radioprotection."

Nanoparticles enable the delivery of therapeutics to the desired tissue and thereby improve efficacy and safety.
However, only about 30 nanoparticle therapeutics have been FDA approved, and none of these 30
nanoparticles use advanced targeting functionality. Key challenges that impede broader nanoparticle
deployment are the complexity of nanoparticle synthesis protocols, a drug loading capacity commonly below
10%, and a one-size-fits-all approach in material optimization. Novel drug-excipient co-aggregates (Reker et al,
Nat Nanotechnol 2021) address these shortcomings through facile synthesis, drug loading of up to 95%, and
by using machine learning for the rational design and optimization of new nanoparticles. However, the
functionalization of these novel materials for actively targeted drug delivery is not yet established, limiting their
deployment to only a narrow set of tissues and indications. The here presented research will address the
unmet need for novel technologies to enable the functionalization of drug-excipient co-aggregate
nanoparticles. Specifically, we will develop novel experimental (aim 1) and computational (aim 2) protocols to
functionalize drug-excipient nanoparticles with antibodies and validate their targeting capabilities in vitro and in
vivo. This project will (1) prototype machine learning for targeted nanoparticle development, (2) for the first time
functionalize drug-excipient nanoparticles to qualitatively enhance the targeting capabilities of highly loaded
nanoparticles, and (3) generate a set of novel, carefully characterized therapeutic nanoparticles with potential
for further clinical development. Through rapid synthesis and machine learning-guided design, the here
proposed platform can rapidly expand the nanomedicine toolbox and streamline nanoparticle development,
evaluation, and manufacturing. Through our modular approach to “mix-and-match” nanoparticle components,
we expect the rational selection of antibodies, drugs, and excipients to enable the design of precision
nanoparticles for personalized drug delivery."
10810824,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in the bone marrow receive mechanical signals via adhesions to the
extracellular matrix and chemical signals from cytokines diffusing through the extracellular matrix. These two
signaling methods influence HSC survival, proliferation, and differentiation, with critical long-term effects on the
immune system and the body’s ability to maintain homeostasis. While in vitro studies using synthetic hydrogels
as artificial matrices have led to new insights on environmental control of HSC behavior, stiffness and solute
transport are highly correlated in synthetic hydrogels, so the mechanisms behind HSC responses to these
environments remain uncertain. The resulting uncertainty and limited control of hydrogel physical
properties may explain why robust methods for in vitro HSC expansion have not been established.
Therefore, the studies proposed here will fill a critical gap in hydrogel design capabilities and apply that new
knowledge to in vitro HSC culture. First, we will create a library of forty-five unique hydrogel formulations by
simultaneously manipulating three structural hydrogel synthesis parameters that our fundamental models have
predicted to create robust, independent variations in stiffness and solute transport. Second, we will culture HSCs
in a smaller, nine-formulation square matrix of hydrogel formulations with independently tuned stiffnesses and
solute transport profiles to decouple how the two physical hydrogel properties affect HSC survival, proliferation,
and differentiation. These studies will provide fundamental insight into HSC interactions with their physical
environment and identify physically optimized conditions for in vitro HSC culture."
10877731,"Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) account for more than 30% of acute care hospital infections.
Bacterial pathogens initially colonize and form biofilm on the catheters, and invade the bladder and eventually
the upper urinary tracts. Prolonged catheterization (~30 days) can increase the chance of CAUTIs to 100%.
Antibiotics prescribed for symptomatic CAUTIs are frequently unable to kill bacteria within the biofilm. Therefore,
inhibiting biofilm formation will significantly reduce the chance of CAUTIs. Catheter biofilms are often
polymicrobial with mixed bacterial communities. Durable biosurface coatings would be an advantageous
approach to inhibit biofilm formation without external control. Existing anti-bacterial surfaces include bactericidal
surfaces (e.g., antimicrobial peptide or silver modified surfaces) and anti-biofouling surfaces (e.g., hydrogel or
poly(ethyleneglycol) based polymer coatings), but all existing approaches are unable to inhibit biofilm
formation on catheters for a prolonged period. Here, we propose a conceptually new fluid-like and non-sticky
biosurface, namely a quasi-liquid surface, which can potentially inhibit biofilm for over 30 days. The quasi-liquid
surface will be made by tethering flexible polymer onto catheter materials with chemical bonding. The untethered
end is highly mobile and behave like a fluid. The innovation is to change the solid/bacterial interaction to quasi-
liquid/bacterial interaction and inhibit polymicrobial biofilm without directly killing bacteria. Our central
hypothesis is that the fluid-like surface will prevent protein adsorption and inhibit polymicrobial biofilm as an
integrated community during long-term catheterization. We will validate the hypothesis with two aims: (1) to study
the mechanism of E. coli biofilm inhibition, and (2) to validate biofilm inhibition of clinical isolates (i.e.,
uropathogenic strains) on the quasi-liquid surface. The team includes PI Dai at UT Dallas with expertise in
biosurfaces and microfluidics, Co-I Palmer with expertise in microbiology and antibiotic resistance in pathogenic
bacteria, and our collaborator Zimmern at UT Southwestern Medical Center with expertise in the management
of complicated UTIs in a variety of clinical settings. This two-year project aims to inhibit polymicrobial biofilm over
30 days that is challenging by a microbiological approach alone. The development of this novel quasi-liquid
surface and the understanding of the quasi-liquid/bacterial interaction will not only benefit the management of
CAUTIs but also open new avenues to better combat biofilms forming on other human implant devices."
10824381,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pontocerebellar Hypoplasia Type 1b (PCH1b) is an autosomal recessive neurological disorder characterized by
hypoplasia/atrophy of the cerebellum and pons that is often fatal within the first year of life. The cerebellum and
pons integrate information from sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain to regulate motor
movements, breathing, and learning motor behavior. Individuals with PCH1b show muscle atrophy/weakness,
microcephaly, and developmental delay. Most individuals with PCH1b do not live past childhood and current
treatment is purely palliative. Mutations that cause PCH1b occur in the EXOSC3 gene, which encodes a
structural cap subunit of an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed RNA processing complex, the
RNA exosome. The RNA exosome is a ribonuclease composed of both structural and catalytic subunits that play
a critical role in the post-transcriptional regulation of RNA. This complex is required for 3’ to 5’ processing and
degradation of a vast number of RNAs in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Post-transcriptional processing of
RNA is a critical regulatory step in gene expression, as underscored by the number of neurological diseases
caused by defects in RNA processing factors. The tissue-specific phenotypes caused by the RNA exosome
complex are challenging to understand based on current models of RNA exosome function with only limited
analysis of the complex in any multicellular model in vivo. Thus, we aim to investigate the in vivo functional
consequences of distinct disease-causing amino acid substitutions in EXOSC3 that are linked to a range of mild
to severe phenotypes in PCH1b. We have generated an allelic series of EXOSC3 disease-linked missense
mutations in the Drosophila orthologue Rrp40 via CRISPR/Cas9 editing technology. Our previous work in flies
revealed an enhanced requirement for Rrp40 in neurons. Furthermore, our RNA-seq analysis of brain-enriched
transcriptomes of Rrp40 mutants revealed increases in steady-state levels of functionally important neuronal
transcripts, suggesting that disease-causing amino acid changes in the Drosophila RNA exosome subunit Rrp40
contribute to neuronal dysfunction. Our goal now is to characterize how disease-causing amino acid substitutions
in Rrp40 alter the molecular and cellular landscape of the developing nervous system in Drosophila in vivo. We
will test the hypothesis that the RNA exosome regulates RNAs that are critical for proper
neurodevelopment and function, a distinct subset of which are regulated by the RNA exosome cap
subunit Rrp40 (EXOSC3) through three complementary aims: 1) Assess the functional consequences of amino
acid substitutions in the Drosophila RNA exosome subunit Rrp40 corresponding to those that cause PCH1b; 2)
Interrogate how Rrp40 mutations affect expression and localization of key neuronal transcripts within the fly
brain; and 3) Exploit a genetic screen to determine whether aberrant accumulation of specific RNA exosome
targets disrupt fly development and/or homeostasis. Successful completion on these aims will provide a
synergistic understanding of RNA exosome biology and invaluable insights into PCH1b disease etiology."
10808119,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Ependymomas are tumors that occur in the brain or spinal cord and are incurable in nearly half of all patients.
Recent molecular classification has identified numerous molecular subgroups of ependymoma with
supratentorial ependymoma ZFTA-RELA fusion positive (ZFTA-RELA) accounting for over 70% of all
supratentorial ependymomas. ZFTA-RELA, a mainly pediatric brain tumor, has also been identified as one of
the subgroups with the worst prognosis. These tumors arise from the oncogenic fusion between a central gene
in the NF-κB pathway, RELA, and a gene with undescribed function, ZFTA. The resulting fusion protein, ZRfus,
aberrantly recruits transcriptional and chromatin remodeling machinery to drive neoplastic transcriptional
programs that includes constitutive activation of NF-κB signaling, activation of inflammatory gene expression
programs, and stem cell programs. To date, chemotherapy has not become standard of care for any of the
subtypes of ependymoma. All targeted therapies tested in ependymoma clinical trials have failed. Therefore,
there is an urgent need to capitalize on the more recent molecular understanding of ZFTA-RELA to develop
novel therapeutic paradigms that increase survival outcomes for these patients. In the search for co-regulatory
proteins as candidate tumor dependencies and targets, we identified the chromatin remodeling complex, FACT
(FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription), as a ZRfus interacting protein. Moreover, FACT is elevated in ZFTA-RELA
compared to normal brain tissue and other ependymoma disease subtypes. Project goal: To thoroughly
investigate FACT as a driver of ZFTA-RELA and to reveal it as a promising therapeutic target for this devastating
disease. FACT, a heterodimer of SPT16 and SSRP1, mainly serves to reorganize nucleosomes to facilitate RNA
polymerase II-mediated transcription. In tumors, we and others have shown that FACT is essential for
maintaining an undifferentiated stem-like state necessary for tumor growth. This is relevant for ZFTA-RELA
tumors as they are characterized as having undifferentiated transcriptional profiles. Project hypothesis: FACT
regulates ZRfus oncogenic and inflammatory genes to maintain an undifferentiated cell state. Compromising
FACT function will lead to reduced tumor growth, modulate tumor inflammation, and improve survival in
orthotopic murine tumor models. Aim 1: Determine if FACT is essential for sustaining transcription of ZRfus
targets (including oncogenes and inflammatory genes) and stem cell identity genes that may be important for
tumorigenicity. Impact: These studies will reveal how FACT regulates ZRfus transcription and tumor cell identity.
Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of genetic and pharmacological disruption of FACT on tumor progression, immune
landscape, overall survival, and normal neurogenesis. Impact: These studies will reveal preclinical insight into
FACT as a therapeutic target, and the efficacy of our candidate small molecule anti-neoplastic as rationale
therapy to inform future clinical trial design. Overall, successful completion of our studies will reveal new
therapeutic options for ZFTA-RELA ependymoma that can rapidly be moved into clinical trials."
10851851,"A condition with no cure, inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects ~3 million patients in the US each year with
the number ever increasing. IBD consists of two closely related disorders, Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative
colitis (UC), and usually manifest in the first three decades of life leading to relentless inflammatory destruction
of the gastrointestinal tract in susceptible individuals. The blood of IBD patients exists in a hypercoagulable state
and thromboembolism (TE), in which life-threatening blood clots break off and travel through the blood stream
to block other vessels, is the most significant cause of mortality in IBD. This increased risk is between 3- and 15-
fold during inactive and active disease respectively. Necropsy studies report thrombosis affects up to 40% of
IBD patients, and 25% of patients suffering a thrombotic event have a fatal outcome. Current treatment regimens
do not address thrombosis risk, and widespread steroid use increases risk. In addition to their classical role in
hemostasis, platelets have emerged as novel regulators of the immune response that act as significant drivers
of inflammation and tissue damage. Clinical reports suggest that platelet abnormalities associate with IBD
activity, severity, and thrombosis risk, however molecular pathways responsible for increased platelet
reactivity and thrombosis in IBD are not well studied. This proposal tests the significant and innovative
hypothesis that platelets become transcriptionally altered toward hyperactivation in IBD and identified
the C-type lectin layilin as a novel regulator of platelet activation and thrombosis. We will employ
complementary clinical, in vitro, and in vivo approaches, a unique resource of patient tissues and expertise with
human platelets and microvascular endothelial cells, along with state-of-the-art sequencing techniques,
CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and intravital microscopy to rigorously test this hypothesis. Specific Aim 1 will
determine how regulators of platelet activation, including layilin, are altered during active and inactive disease in
IBD and contribute to disease outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will determine how layilin regulates platelet activation,
define downstream activation pathways, and identify receptors and ligands mediating platelet adhesion to novel,
inflammatory hyaluronan-cable matrices. Specific Aim 3 will establish how targeting pathways downstream of
layilin in platelets improves inflammation and thrombosis during colitis. Successful completion of these aims will
1) determine how transcriptional changes in platelets contribute to inflammation and thrombosis in IBD, 2)
determine downstream regulators of platelet activation mediated by layilin, 3) establish whether targeting
dysregulated platelet activation pathways in improves inflammation and thrombosis in murine colitis. Data
generated in this proposal will significantly increase our understanding of how the hyperreactive platelets
contribute to the pathophysiology of IBD."
10638160,"Background: Between 2009–2020, VA implemented primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions to prevent
and end homelessness among Veterans, resulting in a 50% reduction in Veteran homelessness. The need to
prevent new episodes of homelessness remains; the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans (NCCHV) is
available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to connect Veterans with resources to address housing instability.
During a 2-year period, 60% of the 110,000 Veterans who contacted NCCHV reported being at risk of
homelessness.
Significance: The proposed study provides the opportunity to assess how NCCHV links Veterans who are at
risk of homelessness with needed services to mitigate their housing instability, which is an important social
determinant of health. This study is supported specifically by the Homeless Program Office and the U.S.
Interagency Council on Homelessness.
Innovation & Impact: Unlike other major initiatives to prevent and end homelessness among Veterans,
NCCHV has not yet been studied; the proposed study will use NCCHV data linked with other administrative
data sources and qualitative methods to explore homelessness prevention among Veterans, which will have
important implications for the field at large.
Specific Aims: (1) Describe characteristics and needs of Veterans accessing NCCHV using existing
administrative data collected through NCCHV and VA’s electronic health record. (2) Assess Veterans’
outcomes following contact with NCCHV. (3) Identify optimal practices for linking Veterans with services
following a contact to NCCHV.
Methodology: This concurrent mixed methods study will include retrospective quantitative analyses examining
Veterans’ contacts with NCCHV, quantitative and qualitative methods assessing how Veterans who are
engaged with VA care are connected with services and associated outcomes (e.g., long -term housing stability,
health care use, mortality), and observations of NCCHV responders and qualitative interviews with key
informants exploring how providers connect Veterans with care following an NCCHV contact and identifying
effective strategies.
Next Steps/Implementation: This study is intended to identify optimal practices to ensure Veterans are
connected with needed resources; future research may develop and study specific interventions to improve
access to care and the prevention of homelessness. From a practice perspective, this study will identify
intervention points for homelessness prevention as well as effective practices to further implement ."
10871907,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In children, asthma is a leading cause of respiratory symptoms and missed school. By mechanisms that
are unclear, obesity in children with asthma is a strong risk factor for asthma that is more symptomatic
and difficult to manage. Among asthmatic children, obesity is associated with a reduced response to
conventional anti-inflammatory asthma drugs. Therefore, a better understanding of the underlying
mechanisms of obesity-related asthma in children is needed. Discovering the mechanisms of `obese
asthma' in order to foster more appropriate phenotype-specific therapies is a pressing public health
need. Obesity, regardless of underlying asthma, is known to impair respiratory system compliance and
inspiratory muscle efficiency leading to increases in the effort of respiration. Our lab found in asthmatic
children that obesity is associated with more frequent asthma symptoms and a higher likelihood of
having dyspnea. Inspiratory training and other forms of rehabilitation are common in adults but is
understudied in pediatrics. Inspiratory `rehabilitation' training (IT) recently has been shown in both
children and adults to reduce dyspnea and asthma symptoms. Our research team found IT over 6 weeks
was well-tolerated, and led to improved inspiratory function and consistently improved trends in clinical
measures, among children with asthma. The central objective of our proposed MICA (Mechanistic Study
of Inspiratory Training in Childhood Asthma) study is to measure the effects of 8-weeks of IT on
inspiratory function (strength and endurance) and small airway dysfunction measured by oscillometry in
6-17 year olds with asthma - with and without obesity. Our central hypothesis is that obesity promotes
inspiratory muscle fatigue and small airway dysfunction, and that IT will mitigate these mechanisms.
In a masked parallel arm trial, 75 youths with asthma (half with obesity) will be randomized to either IT
(low or high dose) or SHAM control for 8-weeks. Inspiratory strength and endurance, small airway
dysfunction (SAD), and exercise capacity will be assessed at baseline and after IT. Aim 1 will describe
the contributions of inspiratory fatigue and SAD to obesity-related asthma. Aim 2 will determine the
effects of IT on inspiratory muscle fatigue. Aim 3 will determine the effects of IT on small airway
dysfunction. The MICA study will provide mechanistic knowledge about pediatric `obese asthma' by
comparing treatment responses by obesity status. Measuring the changes in inspiratory muscle function
and small airways dysfunction following a short regimen IT in children with symptomatic obesity-related
asthma will provide much needed understanding about mechanisms underlying how obesity worsens
asthma in children; and will uncover mechanisms and optimal dosing intensity involved in a safe non-
drug intervention that will pave the way for larger phase III trials."

Bias in how clinicians form relationships with and treat patients exists based on patient race, ethnicity,
gender, socio-economic status, LGBTQ+ status, disability, addiction and other factors. Implicit or
unconscious biases (the ways in which our beliefs, attitudes, and values influence how we see the world
and the people in it) are widespread and affect patients’ health outcomes. Our team has developed Counter
Bias Training Simulation (CBTsim), an innovative and unique training program that uses simulation to
reduce the impact of implicit bias on how people interact and make decisions that affect others. Versions
have been developed for policing and military professionals to enhance their ability to interact with diverse
groups of citizens in unbiased ways. CBTsim has great relevance to healthcare, for which existing bias
trainings are typically video or lecture based, and may be ineffective at reducing the impact of bias on
patient-clinician relationships (PCR) and consequent healthcare delivery. The purpose of this study is to
develop “CBTsim Healthcare” and evaluate its effectiveness at reducing bias in how nurses treat their
patients. The proposed study will be jointly conducted in the Washington State University College of Nursing
Simulation Lab and Providence Medical Center in Spokane. First, we will develop CBTsim Healthcare
scenarios based on an extensive review of the literature on healthcare disparities. Then, we will conduct a
randomized control trial with 100 nurses to test the effectiveness of CBTsim Healthcare. Nurses will receive
2 hours of baseline testing, then 50 (treatment group) will receive a 4-hour CBTsim Healthcare training and
the other 50 (control group) will watch a 1-hour video on implicit bias in healthcare, typical of current
standard practice. Then, all 100 nurses will receive 2 hours of post-intervention testing. Testing will include
the implicit association test (IAT) to measure implicit bias, questionnaires to measure prejudice, and patient
care scenarios using simulation mannequins to test for bias in PCR and other aspects of healthcare
delivery. Finally, we will track treatment and control group nurses in the hospital for 6 months following the
intervention to assess disparities in healthcare, measured using patient satisfaction with nursing care scales
(quantitative measure) and narratives to document experience of PCR (qualitative measure). All major
health agencies have identified reduction of implicit bias in healthcare and resulting minority health
disparities as a matter of extreme importance and urgency. The economic impact of health disparities is an
estimated $230 billion a year, and the social justice impact is immeasurable. Our current focus on nurses is
due to our existing relationship (e.g., on AHRQ R01 HS025965-01), however we anticipate that CBTsim
Healthcare could be modified for other healthcare professional groups and could have a revolutionary
impact on reducing bias in healthcare delivery nationwide."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia, afflicting over 33 million people worldwide and 6
million in the US. AF causes reduced quality of life, stroke and systemic thromboembolism, heart failure, and
increased mortality. Treatment of AF and its complications with nonspecific drugs or procedures is characterized
by unsatisfactory outcomes and significant cost. Acquired heart disease, cardiac remodeling, neurohormonal
factors, aging, and genetic traits have all been correlated with presence of AF. Rapid, uncoordinated atrial
chamber activity is due to shortened or prolonged cardiomyocyte action potential durations acting within a
vulnerable myocardial substrate, causing persistent arrhythmia that features triggering or sustaining circuit re-
entry or early and/or delayed after-depolarizations, respectively. We have recently developed a novel, high
throughput kinetic imaging and analysis platform to characterize cardiomyocyte electrophysiological properties
at single cell resolution, which can be used to conduct high throughput screening (HTS) on functional human
atrial cardiomyocytes derived from Id1-programmed cardiac progenitors created from iPS cells. Our innovation
is the use of this and related assays in a phenotypic screening cascade designed to discover previously
unknown, atrial-specific modulators of cardiomyocyte electrical properties and rhythm. Our hypothesis is this
approach will ultimately generate drug-like starting points for future disease-modifying cardiovascular
therapeutics. The primary HTS assay has been fully optimized in a 384-well format, and as a demonstration of
assay readiness, 400 compounds have been screened (Kolmogorov-Smirnov D-statistic >0.1). Multiple hits from
pilot screens were identified and were confirmed and validated in concentration response experiments. A battery
of downstream assays has been developed and piloted to establish a critical path-testing funnel. Several
compounds identified from the pilot screen were tested to determine if they affected the action potential duration
of atrial cardiomyocytes sensitized by the E375X mutation in KCNA5, and if they had effects on the action
potential durations of wild type and primary atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. This proposal builds on data
from the applicants, an established team from SBP (Drs. Colas and Larson) with basic biology and drug discovery
expertise in the field and access to all necessary technologies. The overall goal of this proposal is to generate
chemical biology research tools and starting points for new drugs. As the critical path assays are all in place, we
anticipate we can rapidly obtain such probe molecules and start to explore their activity. Our future plans are to
ultimately determine hits’ suitability for hit-to-lead activities, begin in vivo evaluation of lead compounds in animal
models and eventually patients, and determine their cellular mechanism of action. This grant’s work product will
serve as preliminary data for hit-to-lead (HTL) grant submissions and parent R01 grant submissions to pursue
understanding of their biological mechanisms."

Ataxin-1 is polyglutamine (polyQ) protein that operates as a chromatin-binding factor and gene repressor. In
recent years, ataxin-1 has been found implicated in multiple pathophysiological processes ranging from the
control of APP amyloidogenic cleavage to the modulation of neural precursor proliferation in the hippocampus.
Our group has also highlighted a novel immunomodulatory function for ataxin-1 targeting B cell responses in
central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity. This experimental evidence adds an additional layer of complexity
to ataxin-1 research, which has been mainly focused on spinocerebellar ataxia type (SCA1)—a
neurodegenerative disorder caused by polyQ expansion mutations in ataxin-1. Importantly, all the efforts carried
out so far to characterize ataxin-1 function have relied only on global ataxin-1 null mice. However, the ubiquitous
expression of ataxin-1 and the complex cytoarchitecture of many tissues have complicated the systematic
analysis of all the molecular mechanisms controlled by ataxin-1 in different cell types and developmental stages.
To fill this gap, here we propose to develop a conditional ataxin-1 knockout mouse line using the binary Cre/Lox
system. This novel in vivo model will be instrumental to dissect the cell-autonomous and cell-mediated effects of
ataxin-1 in any target cytotype. In Specific Aim 1, we will employ CRISPR/Cas9 technology to introduce two
LoxP sites in the mouse genome, flanking one exon of the ataxin-1 encoding Atxn1 gene. In Specific Aim 2, we
will breed the newly generated floxed Atxn1 mouse line with a Cd19-Cre driver line to ablate ataxin-1 in the B
cell compartment. We will then induce the multiple sclerosis model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE) in the conditional Atxn1 knockout mice, in order to study the contribution of ataxin-1 expression in B cells
to autoimmune demyelination. Altogether, the proposed aims hold the power to generate a new research tool
that will substantially advance the current understanding of ataxin-1 biology, with important implications and
lessons for several neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease."
10891505,"Summary/Abstract
Airway wall remodeling is one of the most documented hallmarks of asthma. Despite being a key clinical trait of
long-term asthma, this pathological condition remains largely uncontrolled even with front-line therapies.
Remodeling processes have been traditionally described as an aberrant response to chronic inflammation.
However, this picture is challenged by increasing evidence of airway remodeling as a primary
mechanotransduction event. Recent studies point to mechanical abnormalities in the airway epithelium as a core
factor of asthma pathogenesis. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that the mechanical effects of asthmatic
bronchoconstriction can trigger alone genomic, molecular, and morphological patterns of airway remodeling even
in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. As such, the traditional picture of asthma as a predominantly inflammatory
disease is giving way to a complex, multifactorial scenario where mechanical forces, immune response, and
tissue remodeling all contribute to the development of the disease. Building upon these findings, this proposal
hypothesizes that the mechanogenetic response of the airway epithelium to excessive mechanical stress
constitutes a route to aberrant airway remodeling that is independent of inflammation. To test this
hypothesis, Dr. De Marzio will develop a novel systems biology approach that combines genomics, biostatistics,
and network medicine. RNA-Sequencing and clinical data from asthma population studies will be integrated with
protein interaction networks to: 1) Identify the mechanogenetic signature of bronchoconstriction in the asthmatic
epithelium and understand its role on asthmatic phenotypes; 2) define the role of airway epithelial cell
heterogeneity in response to mechanical compression; and 3) determine the signaling pathways mediating
compression-induced airway remodeling to discover candidate therapeutic markers. In doing so, this project will
represent the first comprehensive study on the mechanogenomics of asthma. The intrinsic interdisciplinary
nature of this proposal makes Dr. De Marzio uniquely qualified to pursue this research direction. The proposed
research will leverage her physics background and her experience in computational biology and network
modeling to understand the pathogenic role of mechanical forces in asthma. For the successful development of
this project, she will receive additional training in airway pathobiology and pulmonary medicine and she will be
supported by an outstanding mentoring team composed of biologists, network scientists, and pulmonologists.
Dr. De Marzio's long-term career goal is to establish an independent research program at the intersection of
genomics, biomechanics, and network science. The resources offered by this award combined with the rich
intellectual environment of the Channing Division of Network Medicine will put her in an advantageous position
to transition to independence and submit multiple R01s. Dr. De Marzio's findings will pave the way for the future
development of a mechanomedicine of asthma."
10845615,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Through Medicare-funded skilled home health care (HH), community-living older adults may receive skilled
nursing, therapy, and aide services in their home. HH is a crucial source of care for older adults with Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD); 31% of the 3.4 million Medicare beneficiaries who access HH each
year have ADRD. The majority (92%) of HH patients with ADRD require help from family and unpaid caregivers
to implement the HH plan of care. Yet, caregiver needs are not systematically assessed during HH and they
frequently face unmet training/support needs. Unmet caregiver needs contribute to increased costs, decreased
patient/family satisfaction, and higher patient risk for hospitalization and institutionalization during HH. The
proposed K01 will develop, refine, and pilot test an ADRD caregiver needs assessment intervention for HH:
DECLARE (Dementia Caregivers' Link to Assistance and Resources). DECLARE will harness a web-based
survey platform to elicit information from ADRD caregivers about their availability, capabilities, and needs at the
time of HH admission. This data will then populate in the HH patient record along with suggested next steps for
HH staff. Specific Aims include: (1) Develop an ADRD caregiver self-assessment intervention (DECLARE)
prototype; (2) Iteratively refine the intervention (DECLARE) in partnership with key stakeholders; (3) Implement
and pilot test DECLARE via an embedded Pragmatic Clinical Trial, evaluating for feasibility, acceptability, and
impact on HH care team/caregiver communication and support. Aims will be pursued in partnership with Visiting
Nurse Service of New Yok (VNSNY), the largest non-profit HH provider in the nation. Findings will support a
planned R01 to test DECLARE's impact on patient clinical outcomes and caregiver self-efficacy and burden.
 Dr. Julia Burgdorf, PhD, is a Research Scientist at the Center for Home Care Policy & Research at VNSNY.
She is ideally positioned to lead the proposed research as an expert in family caregiver involvement in HH care
and an embedded researcher at VNSNY. Her career goal is to improve home- and community-based care for
older adults by developing pragmatic clinical interventions that facilitate provider-led engagement and support of
family caregivers, with a focus on caregivers for individuals with ADRD. To achieve this goal, Dr. Burgdorf will
pursue targeted mentorship and training in 5 key areas during the K01: (1) consumer-facing technologies for
clinical innovation in HH, (2) human-centered design, (3) intervention evaluation and embedded Pragmatic
Clinical Trials, (4) ADRD research, and (5) independent grant writing. She has assembled an interdisciplinary
mentoring and advisory team whose complementary research expertise and experience mentoring early career
investigators will provide invaluable support and guidance, while fostering her ongoing collaborations with
academic research settings and a major learning health system. This K01 would provide Dr. Burgdorf with the
necessary time and learning experiences to transition to an independent investigator equipped to lead impactful
interventional research improving provider/caregiver collaboration and care outcomes in the HH setting."
10877741,"Cancer is a common cause of [functional decline and morbidity] in older adults, with more than two-thirds of
new cases occurring in adults aged 60 years or more. Surgery is the most effective cancer treatment, but it
brings many risks that threaten recovery of physical function in older patients. Older adults needing surgical
treatment face the threats of age-related loss of muscle [quality, strength and endurance, malnutrition
(including cancer-related nutrition impact)], inflammation, and cachexia [caused by cancer and its
treatments]. Further, older adults often experience marked deterioration of functional abilities and reduced
physical reserve and may never regain their baseline level of physical function. This proposal addresses a gap in
knowledge on perioperative interventions to maximize restoration of functional capacity, minimize muscle loss
due to catabolic circumstances, and prevent malnutrition for these patients. Because a treatment using several
nutrients aimed at multiple mechanisms (targets) is expected to be strongly superior to single nutrient
treatment, we will use this approach to target a number of factors involved in cancer cachexia, including
anorexia, alterations in fat and protein metabolism, and systemic inflammation, as well as to prevent or correct
nutritional deficiencies. We expect this intervention to provide superior recovery of physical function and to
improve [physiologic, metabolic] and Veteran-centered outcomes versus a [typical] treatment. Thus, in a
pragmatic clinical trial, we will test a multi-targeted nutrition intervention, applied in a biphasic pattern (pre-
and post-operatively) in older Veterans newly referred for surgical cancer treatment.
In a two-armed 1:1 randomized controlled trial, we will test this nutrition-optimized treatment for senior health
(NOSH), a multi-targeted treatment provided in biphasic intervals (8 weeks before and 24 weeks after
discharge from surgery), and compare it to a [typical nutrition regimen (Typical )] with regards to (Primary
Aim 1) physical function, [(Secondary Aim 2) physiologic and metabolic outcomes], and (Exploratory Aim 3)
Veteran-centered outcomes, including quality of life (QoL), cancer-related nutrition impact symptoms, and
postoperative outcome measures. Older Veterans approaching surgery for [Stage II-III] gastrointestinal or
genitourinary cancer who are at high risk for having their physical abilities markedly decline during treatment
will be enrolled and randomized to NOSH or the [Typical regimen], with both groups prescribed low-intensity
resistance exercise thrice weekly. The NOSH intervention will include generous high-quality protein (30
g/meal; 1.5 g/kg/d) and other key nutrients linked with muscle preservation, namely b-hydroxy-b-
methylbutyrate, a metabolite of the amino acid leucine (HMB; 3 g/d), and vitamin D and a daily multivitamin
supplemented to a vitamin D level of 800 IU/d). Aim 1 will evaluate changes in physical function in the NOSH
intervention arm relative to the [Typical regimen]. Our working hypothesis is that the NOSH intervention will
result in improved physical function (Aim 1) and [physiologic and metabolic outcomes (Aim 2) relative to the
Typical regimen.] We also predict improvements in Veteran-centered outcomes (Aim 3).
This research addresses an important gap in the evidence for best practice of nutritional care for frail older
adults approaching surgical cancer treatment. If the hypotheses of this study are correct, there will be strong
evidence for a major change in treatment approaches for a heretofore mostly neglected population of high-risk
older adults with cancer. More importantly, this improvement in cancer treatment will lead to stronger, more
rapid physical recoveries and better quality of life for this population. The findings will also benefit the VA by
decreasing demands on the health care system via reductions in postoperative complications and the hastening
of recovery of physical function."
10889176,"Endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are major causes of female subfertility and infertility. Each
is accompanied by chronic endometrial inflammation triggered and perpetuated by uncertain mechanisms.
Potential roles for immune cells, specifically T and B lymphocytes, in endometrial inflammation are largely
unexplored despite their being key orchestrators and mediators of tissue inflammation in many other non-uterine
contexts. Furthermore, the antigen specificities of endometrial T and B cells are not well described, and whether
self-antigen specific clones contribute to disorders with poor reproductive outcomes is unclear, despite evidence
that endometriosis, in particular, may have an autoimmune component. These knowledge gaps represent major
opportunities for improving reproductive outcomes for infertile patients with endometriosis and PCOS. Moreover,
these disorders represent ideal models for investigating how immune dysregulation in the endometrium may
contribute to infertility and subfertility more broadly. Accordingly, the goal of this project is to determine how T
and B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of endometrial inflammation and, by extension, decidual inflammation,
relevant to implantation failure and poor pregnancy outcomes. Herein, we propose to deeply characterize the
frequencies, transcriptomes, proteomes, TCR/BCR repertoires, and antigen specificities of endometrial and
decidual T and B cells across the menstrual cycle and in early pregnancy, respectively, in the context of healthy
women (Aim 1) and those with endometriosis and PCOS (Aim 2). Particular emphasis will be placed on regulatory
lymphocytes, which include conventional CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), and cells from the CD8+ T cell and B
cell lineages, since these cells are likely critical for ensuring a controlled inflammatory microenvironment optimal
for implantation and successful pregnancy. Since the differentiation and function of these cells can be locally
influenced by non-immune endometrial and decidual cells, such as stromal fibroblasts, Aim 3 will define the role
of such cells in supporting suppressive lymphocyte differentiation and identify the key regulators involved in
these processes. The proposal will also determine how endometriosis and PCOS alter the phenotypes of the NK
cell lineage of lymphocytes, given the contribution of NK cells to important developmental events of early
pregnancy. The Aims will be accomplished using archived and prospectively collected endometrial/decidual
specimens from a total of 150 well-characterized subjects. Our central hypothesis is that different lymphocyte
subsets with diverse roles in immunoregulation and microbial defense work together in a coordinated fashion to
establish and maintain the appropriate endometrial and decidual environment for pregnancy success, and that
these cells are altered and derailed by inflammatory disorders associated with poor reproductive outcomes.
Completion of this study will reveal fundamental insights into lymphocyte contributions to tolerance and can
reveal new targets for diagnostics and therapeutics to improve reproductive success."
10840850,"Project Summary
The coordinated regulation of chromatin structure, transcription factor binding and RNA
expression is fundamental to cellular differentiation. Methods for measuring different layers of
gene regulation within single cells can be used to determine essential regulators of cell
differentiation and function as sensitive markers of cellular identity and lineage potential. To this
end, we (Buenrostro) have recently developed SHARE-seq (Simultaneous High-throughput
ATAC and RNA Expression with sequencing), for joint measurement of chromatin accessibility
and gene expression within the same single-cell, at low-cost and massive throughput. Using
SHARE-seq, we have shown that co-analysis of ATAC- and RNA-seq data from the same cell
can be used to associate transcription factors to their target regulatory regions and distal
regulatory elements to their target genes, enabling the definition of causal gene regulatory
networks. Furthermore, we have shown that changes in chromatin accessibility precedes changes
in gene expression, foreshadowing lineage commitment, and identifying a role for chromatin
accessibility in priming chromatin for gene activation. Here, we propose the establishment of the
Gene Regulation Core (GRC), which will be led by Dr. Jason Buenrostro at Harvard University's
Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biology. As part of this P01 proposal, the GRC will
enable the P01 members with SHARE-seq and other genomic technologies established in the
Buenrostro lab, which can be used to functionally annotate regulatory regions, identify key
transcription factors and chromatin regulators, define gene regulatory networks and parse cellular
states. The GRC will work closely with the P01 labs to design experiments, and organize and
collect hematopoietic samples (Aim 1). The GRC will use SHARE-seq to jointly profile chromatin
accessibility and RNA expression at the single cell level. This will include extending SHARE-seq
to capabilities uniquely enabled by SHARE-seq, such as the readout of transcribed lineage
barcodes and Clonal Hematopoiesis-associated mutations (Aim 2). Finally, the GRC will be
responsible for the primary processing of the data, data management, developing web interface
tools and organizing data discussions and workshops between the P01 labs (Aim 3). Overall, the
GRC will offer a complete solution for the single-cell genomics needs of the P01 community
through a unique and innovative suite of genomic technologies."
10840856,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human hematopoietic system is maintained by a pool of hundreds of thousands self-renewing
hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitor cells. Recently, large genetic studies have revealed
the prevalence of somatic, clonal mutations, in blood cells of healthy individuals, a process referred as
clonal hematopoiesis (CH). The mechanisms by which a single hematopoietic cell carrying a CH-
related mutation expands at the expense of its normal counterparts is a major question with
implications to treat and monitor patients with CH-related complications. Another poorly understood
aspect of CH is its incomplete penetrance. While it is speculated that most humans by age 50 will have
accumulated one of these mutations in their long-lived hematopoietic progenitors, the degree of clonal
expansion among the population is tremendously varied. The cellular and molecular determinants of
this range of clonal behaviors are unclear. My lab has utilized high-resolution cellular barcoding
technologies to find that hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells exhibit remarkable heterogeneity in
their functional response to CH-associated mutations. Our analyses have also identified a number of
genes that characterizes the clones exhibiting hyper-competition. Based on these data, our project here
aims to understand the molecular mechanisms by which only a subset of hematopoietic progenitors
gains and maintains a competitive advantage. Additionally, our approach will take advantage of novel
physiologically relevant mouse models of CH where mutations can be directed to stem or progenitor cell
compartments. Our efforts here will be facilitated by state-of-the-art genomic and functional tools
uniquely suited to characterize heterogeneity at the single cell level. Successful accomplishment of the
aims of this project will provide new insight into the mechanisms of clonal dominance in states associated
with CH. Finally, our work will potentially identify actionable targets to manipulate clonal competition."
10799671,"Project Summary/Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is largely characterized by dysregulated
cytokines and antimicrobial responses. Innate mechanisms are the initiating drives of host responses to
microbes and the resulting cytokine and antimicrobial responses need to be carefully balanced. Mitochondrial
pathways play a key role in mediating these innate responses and a dysregulation in mitochondrial
mechanisms has been increasingly recognized to play a role in IBD. The focus on the mitochondrial
dysregulation in IBD has been predominantly in epithelial cells. However, mitochondria contribute to innate
immune outcomes through a variety of mechanisms, including metabolic pathways, reactive oxygen species,
communication with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release. Of the >240
IBD-associated loci a number of genes within these loci modulate host innate responses and mitochondrial
function through both direct and indirect mechanisms. As such, upon encounter of human macrophages with
microbial products, we have found IBD-associated genes that regulate glycolysis and in turn macrophage
polarization, the mitochondrial respiratory chain and mtROS, and ER stress. We further find that upon human
macrophage stimulation by a range of pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands, release of mtDNA is
dramatically increased along with activation of the cGAS- STING pathway. The cGAS-STING pathway then
serves to promote responses across the many PRRs. We have preliminary data that at least one IBD-
associated gene which partially localizes to the mitochondria, LACC1, modulates PRR-induced activation of
the cGAS-STING pathway, and in turn, downstream PRR-initiated downstream outcomes. We hypothesize
that the cGAS-STING pathway amplifies responses across a broad range of PRRs through a variety of
intracellular mechanisms, that the threshold of this regulation is important in susceptibility to intestinal
inflammation and might be therapeutically targeted under conditions of intestinal inflammation, and that IBD-
associated geneticvariants regulate these outcomes, thereby influencing key innate immune outcomes.
Relevance: These combined human cell and mouse studies will provide insight into mitochondrial
mechanisms regulating key outcomes in macrophages, the manner in which these mechanisms are altered in
IBD patients and in the context of IBD risk variants, and how these mechanisms might be modulated during
intestinal inflammation in order to improve outcomes in vivo. These comprehensive and mechanistic studies
will establish a foundation for additional studies to therapeutically target mitochondrialpathways shared across
innate immune responses so as to restore innate immune dysregulation."
10817909,"ABSTRACT
Passive transfer of immunoglobulins (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 occurs from the mother to fetus by
transplacental transfer and may protect the neonate against infection or cause disease. Recent studies have
shown maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to the dysregulation of infant immune responses in cord blood
including altered T cell related cytokines and perturbations of immune cell subsets. It has not been yet shown if
this immune priming is SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific or if it is secondary to non-specific maternal or placental
inflammation. Additionally, recent evidence has shown waning immunity after vaccination and further work is
needed to understand protective immunogenic responses to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes to optimize future
vaccination strategies in pregnancy, to benefit both mother and infant. We hypothesize that maternal SARS-
CoV-2 infection actively primes fetal immune responses in utero through 1) the transfer of immune complexes
with immunostimulatory activity, and 2) the passive transfer of both protective and autoreactive antibodies to the
fetus. Further, we hypothesize that differential placental tissue responses correlate with differences in maternal-
fetal crosstalk. In this application, we leverage valuable samples from two prospective cohorts of COVID-19
infection and vaccination in pregnancy to address the following specific aims: 1) Investigate the fetal T cell
immunostimulatory potential of SARS-CoV-2 Ags transferred to the fetus in immune complexes through a novel
mass spectrometry-based approach; 2) Map the antibody repertoire profiles of Abs generated after SARS-CoV-
2 infection vs vaccination to determine the breadth of maternal-fetal transfer of protective vs autoreactive immune
responses using PhIP-Seq technology; and 3) Identify differential transcriptomic and proteomic responses to
SARS-CoV-2 infection at the maternal-fetal interface that mediate differences in immune complex transfer
through the application of laser microdissection on patient biopsies. These results have immediate relevance to
understanding novel mechanisms of maternal-fetal immune crosstalk after viral infection. Our data will aid
vaccination strategies to protect both the mother and baby against COVID-19 and may significantly advance in
our understanding of maternal-fetal immune interplay in perinatal infections."
10933395,"Identifying Convergent Circuit Disruptions Across Genetically-Distinct Rat Models of ASD
Summary: Recent advances from human genetic and animal studies have greatly increased our
understanding of the molecular and cellular basis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Connecting these risk
factors to clinical symptoms in autism remains a significant challenge that has impeded the development of
ASD therapies, as evidenced by disappointing results from recent large-scale clinical trials. A fundamental
question is if distinct ASD mutations converge on shared disease mechanisms at some level of neuronal
function to ultimately give rise to the behavioral and neurocognitive phenotypes that define autism. Identifying
these pathophysiological convergence points is essential for developing treatment strategies that may
generalize across genetically heterogenous forms of ASD. We have previously shown that rodent models of
the two most common genetically-defined causes of autism— Fmr1 KO mouse model of Fragile X syndrome
(FX) and Tsc2+/- mouse model of tuber sclerosis complex (TSC)— exhibit opposite synaptic and cellular
phenotypes that responded to opposite pharmacological interventions, despite sharing a molecular pathway
and presenting with similar behavioral phenotypes. This proposal will determine if Fmr1 and Tsc2 mutations
converge on common circuit disruptions that can account for shared behavioral phenotypes in these disorders.
We will address this question through the lens of the auditory system, as auditory processing impairments are
a common and debilitating sensory phenotype in ASD that directly impacts communicative and social behavior
while also providing robust and translationally-relevant behavioral and physiological read-outs, due to its well-
characterized neuroanatomy and evolutionary conserved nature. Specifically, this proposal will test the
hypothesis that circuit hyperexcitability due to altered excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance and dysregulated
parvalbumin expressing (PV+) interneuron function is a convergent disease mechanism that leads to shared
deficits in auditory perception and information processing in rat models of FX and TSC. This will be
accomplished by combining the unique behavioral advantaged of rat models with in vivo and ex vivo
electrophysiological recordings, cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations, and molecular profiling
techniques. Determining how Fmr1 and Tsc2 mutations lead to auditory processing deficits and neural circuit
dysfunction will not only help identify novel therapies for disabling sensory phenotypes in these disorders, but
may shed light on recurring pathophysiological motifs that generalize across neurocognitive domains and
extend to diverse forms of ASD."
10831433,"During the last two decades it has become clear that the retina is not just a static network of neurons. Retinal
neurons change their properties and connections during aging or disease in a process termed retinal remodeling
or plasticity. However, mechanisms that mediate plasticity, as well as the impact of plasticity on light signaling in
the retina and vision are still poorly defined. Our long-term goal is to advance the field of retinal remodeling
towards development of vision restoration therapies with improved outcomes. This goal is achieved by (i)
determining compensatory mechanisms in the retina that can promote vision, and (ii) quantifying the impact of
remodeling on the retinal output and vision during photoreceptor degenerative disease. Our central hypothesis
is that a partial loss of sensory input from rods increases the gain of transmission of the remaining input to rod
bipolar cells (RBCs) in the retina to promote vision, whereas extensive loss of the sensory input leads to a
corruption of the light signal transmission and exacerbation of vision loss. This central hypothesis will be tested
in a mouse model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by the rhodopsin P23H mutation. The
rationale of this project is that delineating a compensatory mechanism in the retina will yield an accessible target
for promoting vision in photoreceptor degenerative diseases where this does not happen naturally. Secondly,
new knowledge about the impact and time course of constructive and destructive remodeling in the retina on
vision will generate critical information about the expected outcomes of vision restoration therapies. The central
hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) Determine the mechanism underlying the increase of rod - RBC
signal transmission at early stages of retinal degenerative disease; and 2) Determine the impact of inner retinal
remodeling on light signal transmission during photoreceptor degenerative disease. In the first aim, a working
hypothesis that rod – RBC transmission is potentiated in P23H mice via synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1)-dependent
pathway in rod synaptic terminal will be tested by using P23H mice with a rod-specific deletion of Syt1 and in
vivo/ex vivo Electroretinogram as well as patch clamp physiology. In addition, these mice will be used to
determine the impact of this compensatory mechanism on vision using behavior methods. In the second aim,
genetic silencing of photoreceptors and optogenetics will be used together with ganglion cell multielectrode array
electrophysiology in P23H mice to evaluate the impact of inner retina remodeling on ganglion cell output during
photoreceptor degeneration from early to late-stage disease. This innovative work 1) challenges current dogma
of destructive remodeling by asserting that in some retinal degenerative diseases, the retina compensates for
the loss of photoreceptors to maintain stable output and vision; and 2) applies genetic and optogenetic tools to
determine the causal role of remodeling on retinal output signal and vision. The proposed research is significant
because it will transform our understanding of plasticity in the retina and how it impacts retinal function and
vision, critical knowledge required for restoring normal vision at different stages of blinding disease."
10862790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Every year, about 11,000 home healthcare (HHC) agencies across the United States provide care to more
than 5 million older adults. Currently, about one in three HHC patients are hospitalized or visit an emergency
department (ED) and up to 40% of these events are preventable with appropriate and timely care. However,
these numbers have not improved over the last decade, despite national and local quality improvement efforts.
 Recent advances in a subfield of data science—automated speech processing—have unlocked an
untapped rich data stream that can improve risk identification by analyzing nurse-patient verbal
communication. The proposed study brings together an interdisciplinary team of experts in home healthcare
nursing, automated speech processing, natural language processing, and risk model development to explore
whether automated speech processing can improve timely identification of patients at risk in home healthcare
and potentially reduce their hospitalizations and ED visits.
 Specifically, the aims of this study are: Aim 1: Refine and finalize an automated speech processing system
to identify hospitalization and ED visit risk factors in patient-nurse verbal communications. Aim 2: Explore to
what extent data extracted from patient-nurse communications can improve risk prediction for hospitalizations
and ED visits, when compared against the risk model based on electronic health record data only.
 This study will build a first-of-a-kind hospitalization and ED visit risk model that automatically incorporates
data from patient-nurse verbal communication. In future work, this risk model can be integrated into home
healthcare clinical workflows to trigger timely and personalized alerts about concerning patient trends, which
will in turn activate appropriate and timely care to prevent avoidable hospitalizations and ED visits from HHC."
10879158,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The mechanism of disease progression from benign to fatal phenotypes in X-linked adrenoleukodystro-
phy remains unknown and there is no satisfactory cure for the disease. 60% of male X-ALD patients develop
fatal cerebral disease (cALD) while the remaining 40% develop milder adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) charac-
terized by axonopathy. The primary genetic defect in X-ALD (mutation/deletion in ABCD1 gene) and the bio-
chemical defect (accumulation of very long chain fatty acid; C>22:0 in plasma and tissues) cannot predict the
onset of AMN or cALD. The long-term goal is to contribute to the development of novel clinically useful, mecha-
nism-based prognostic indicators and therapeutic options for X-ALD. The overall objective for this application is
to determine differential metabolic energy metabolism underlying phenotype variability (AMN vs cALD) in the
human astrocytes of male X-ALD phenotypes. The central hypothesis is that altered metabolic reprogramming
underlies the differential phenotype development in AMN and cALD astrocytes. These astrocytes were differen-
tiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which, in turn, were generated by reprogramming of human
control, AMN and cALD patient-derived fibroblasts. This hypothesis is supported by untargeted metabolomics
pilot data identifying metabolites altered between healthy-control and cALD phenotype postmortem brain and
between AMN and cALD astrocytes. Within the cALD brain white matter, unique metabolite changes were rec-
orded between distant normal looking areas and areas adjacent to the plaque suggesting an association with
disease progression. OXPHOS and glycolysis were found to be decreased (low metabolic state) in human cALD
astrocytes. This low metabolic state suggests a role for novel alternative source(s) of fuel driving the progression
to cALD phenotype in astrocytes. The rationale for the proposed research is that a mechanistic modelling of
aberrant energy metabolism in AMN and cALD astrocytes will provide a basis for predicting disease progression
and new opportunities for identification of targets for novel therapeutic drug design. The central hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine the role of metabolic reprogramming in newly “forged”
AMN and cALD astrocytes; and 2) Determine the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction in metabolic repro-
gramming in AMN and cALD astrocytes. The approach will take advantage of control, AMN and cALD astrocytes
recently generated from iPSCs in the laboratory. This proposal is innovative because it departs from the status
quo by identifying for the first time, metabolic pathways differentially altered in human AMN and cALD astrocytes.
The proposed research is significant because the cellular mechanism(s) that lead to less severe AMN or fatal
cALD phenotype in response to same ABCD1 mutation remain unknown even four decades after the identifica-
tion of gene defect in X-ALD. Successful completion of the proposed research is expected to provide a necessary
conceptual framework for the subsequent development of clinically effective strategies for predicting disease
progression and improving current limited treatment options."
10813097,"Project Summary/Abstract
Young people transitioning from the foster care system have elevated risk for a range of mental health diagnoses that
for many are exacerbated by psychosocial coping difficulties, sparse support networks, and service disengagement. This
population is less prepared to cope with mental health challenges and more likely to have negative perspectives on help-
seeking, increasing the risk of unmet treatment needs as service use rapidly declines following the exit from foster care.
Our long-term goal is to deploy a scalable secondary prevention program that leverages existing foster youth transition
services to improve mental health functioning and service use before and after exiting foster care. Our short-term
objective is to remotely test a transdiagnostic group intervention called Stronger Youth Networks and Coping (SYNC) that
targets cognitive schemas influencing stress responses, including mental health help-seeking and service engagement,
among foster youth with behavioral health risk. SYNC aims to increase youth capacity to appraise stress and regulate
emotional responses, to flexibly select adaptive coping strategies, and to promote informal and formal help-seeking as
an effective coping strategy. SYNC results from intervention development to design a novel program using evidence-
based cognitive change methods, including adapting the Coping Effectiveness Training (CET) curriculum for foster youth.
SYNC is designed for delivery by service providers in federally-funded Independent Living Programs (ILPs) accessed by
most foster youth in the US. Initial feedback from foster youth, service providers, and our advisory panel confirmed the
acceptability of SYNC curriculum topics (e.g., stress and coping, navigating services) and program strategy (e.g., groups
co-facilitated by “near-peer” young adults with foster care and mental health care experience). The proposed aims will
establish whether the 10-module program engages the targeted proximal mechanisms with a signal of efficacy on
clinically-relevant outcomes, and whether a fully-powered RCT of SYNC is feasible in the intended service context. Our
first specific aim is to refine our SYNC curriculum and training materials, prior to testing SYNC in a remote single-arm trial
with two cohorts of 8-10 Oregon foster youth aged 16-20 (N=16). Our second aim is to conduct a remote two-arm
individually-randomized group treatment trial with Oregon foster youth aged 16-20 with indicated behavioral health risk
(N=80) to examine: (a) intervention group change on proximal mechanisms of coping self-efficacy and help-seeking
attitudes, compared to services-as-usual at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up: and (b) association between the
mechanisms and targeted outcomes, including emotional regulation, coping behaviors, mental health service use, and
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Our third aim is to refine and standardize the intervention and research
protocol for an effectiveness trial, including confirming transferability with national stakeholders. The demonstration of
target engagement with initial evidence of efficacy, plus standardized intervention materials and a feasible research
protocol, will prepare us for an effectiveness trial (R01) of a model that is expected to be widely transferable for
implementation across the country, and one that can ultimately be adapted for other youth service settings (e.g.,
juvenile justice) and subgroups (e.g., LGBTQ, youth of color), expanding long-term public health impact."
10811722,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 More than 85 million cases of COVID-19 have been recorded in the US alone, and up to 40% of survivors
report Long-COVID symptoms including cognitive impairments. Together with evidence that inflammation
during adulthood increases risk for later cognitive decline, this raises the prospect that the COVID-19
pandemic will cause a future “second pandemic” in Alzheimer’s disease and age-related dementias. In this
project, we will identify specific mechanisms by which single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses (e.g., SARS-COV-
2) triggered innate immune signaling contributes to long-lasting memory impairments, exaggerated cognitive
decline during aging, and risk for dementias including Alzheimer’s disease. Our main goal is to determine the
impact of innate immune signaling as a consequence of ssRNA viruses on exaggeration of age-related
cognitive decline and risk for dementias including Alzheimer’s Disease. We will use a subchronic inflammation
protocol, established in my laboratory, together with behavioral tests of memory, protein biochemistry, and
gene expression assays to identify persistent changes in inflammatory state and neuroplasticity mechanisms
that exacerbate cognitive decline. We will use wild-type mice and APP/PS1 transgenic mice to determine
whether TLR7-induced inflammation causes acceleration of age-related cognitive decline and AD-like
pathology. Findings from this project will demonstrate how COVID-19, and other TLR7-induced inflammation
increases risk for dementia; identify sex differences in COVID-related vulnerability to cognitive decline; and
provide a basis for novel preventive strategies and treatments to reduce risk for Alzheimer’s disease and other
dementias in the post-COVID-19 population."
10818526,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Specific long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) that are overexpressed in breast cancer aid in diagnosis and
promote molecular mechanisms that drive breast cancer progression. Our recent work has identified a breast-
cancer associated LncRNA that converts from an oncogene to a tumor suppressor by mutation of one single
nucleotide. This “antimorphic” effect is caused by the prevention of RNA methylation at this one site, allowing
overexpression of the converted LncRNA to decrease cancer phenotypes more so than depletion of the wild-
type version. This exciting new finding prompts us to delve deeper into how this is occurring, with the ultimate
goald of specifically disrupting this m6A pathway as a novel therapeutic approach.
 Proposed therapeutic intervention for breast cancer-associated LncRNAs has mainly been aimed at
depleting the cancer-promoting RNA, with the assumption that this would be the most effective approach to
reduce cancer phenotypes. Our results suggest a novel therapeutic approach to oncogenic LncRNAs, where
disruption of RNA methylation alone has a greater impact than simple elimination of the RNA. The current
proposal provides a roadmap to understand how to elicit antimorphic effects in an oncogenic LncRNA. We aim
to use this proof-of-principle project as a springboard for future work that would lead this therapeutic approach
to the clinic.
 We hypothesize that m6A modification sites on a specific breast cancer-associated LncRNAs can be
targeted and disrupted to reverse oncogenic behavior below baseline, providing a roadmap for a potential new
therapeutic approach. In our first aim, a mutant HOTAIR LncRNA that behaves as an antimorph will be studied
for physical interactions in triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells using proteomic approaches.
Physical and functional interactors will then be depleted in a breast cancer cell line that overexpresses the
antimorph HOTAIR to determine their role in the antimorph mechanism. Recently-derived primary cell lines from
breast cancer patient-derived xenografts will be used to determine the generalizability of this mechanism. In the
second aim, anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASOs) will be used to disrupt the m6A site on HOTAIR to elicit
antimorph behavior. In a parallel approach, we will developed an optimized strategy to deliver the antimorph
HOTAIR RNA directly to suppress cancer phenotypes. These two approaches are complementary in cases of
breast cancer where HOTAIR is overexpressed and those where it is not.
 Our work would be a foundational test of a novel therapeutic approach in breast cancer by inducing
antimorphic behavior of an m6A-modified LncRNA. In general, the ASO-based strategy is a novel approach to
breast cancer therapeutics. RNA therapeutics are now a reality and are gaining wide acceptance. Our project
capitalizes on this exciting atmosphere with an ambitious, novel approach to noncoding RNA interventions in
breast cancer. By taking advantage of a molecular switch provided by m6A, we can reverse the activity of an
oncogenic LncRNA to reverse breast cancer properties."

Tubulin plays fundamental roles in axon formation, maintenance, and dysfunction. Despite this, how tubulin is
delivered to axons remains highly controversial, and how tubulin is removed from axons is entirely unknown.
This is due to technical challenges in visualizing tubulin movement, that stem from the fact that tubulin is highly
abundant in immobile polymers and that when movement occurs, it is extremely slow. We recently overcame
similar obstacles to the visualization of spectrin delivery to axons. Here we propose to modify, adapt and
validate our methodology in order to generate a new probe for visualizing the axonal delivery and removal of
endogenous tubulin, in vivo, with single-axon resolution. Successful completion of this project will reveal how
tubulin is delivered and removed from axons, and how delivery and removal are balanced to generate a steady
state cytoskeletal mass under different physiological conditions. This knowledge and tools will move the field
forward by opening the way for more mechanistic and disease-focused studies. Furthermore, the approach
could be adapted to visualize the axonal delivery and removal of other slow axonal transport cargo."
10933410,"This is an epidemiological study on the epigenetic origins of asthma in children and young adulthood. It has been
increasingly recognized that asthma is a consequence of joint activities among genes rather than of individual genes’
independent contributions. Examining individual contributions of CpGs on asthma development is biologically
ungrounded and we take a high risk of concluding incomplete and/or misleading findings. Such limitations have been
widely agreed upon, and methods to address joint activities among genes have been proposed, including approaches
to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and those for detection of gene networks. However, the DMR
approach is potentially flawed, since almost all DMRs are inferred based on effects of each individual CpG rather
than joint effects of CpGs. Defining networks amongst genes or CpGs allow better understanding of their concerted
effects. Current network constructions, however, either focus on a population as a whole or on a specific group.
Constructing one network for a general population lacks purity, since it overlooks underlying heterogeneity among
subjects (e.g., heterogeneity in asthma risk). Whilst building a network for a group of disease patients will substantially
limit the ability to predict and prevent disease, due to potential reverse-causation on gene activities. Currently, no
methods are available that address heterogeneity while building networks. We propose an approach to detect distinct
epigenetic networks (DENs) with each unique to a group of subjects via network clustering using DNA methylation
(DNAm) data before disease manifestation, e.g., at-birth DNAm and childhood asthma. The constructed network in
each cluster will represent unique epigenetic features of a homogeneous group of subjects. Differentiation between
networks constructed under different conditions support the feasibility of network clustering in a general population.
In addition, in asthma studies, we will study the longitudinal association of DENs at birth with asthma incidence in
children, post-adolescence, and young adulthood, assess the role of age, sex, and race in this association, and examine
the benefit of evaluating joint rather than individual activities of CpGs on asthma incidence. The findings of this study
will inform to what extent CpGs work jointly and contribute to the development of asthma, and will benefit future
studies on early prediction of asthma acquisition for each sex and different races. Furthermore, the method to be
developed will be readily applied to other health conditions with other omics data different from DNAm. We will carry
out this important study in three birth cohorts, two cohorts with whites (the IOWBC and ALSPAC birth cohorts focusing
on asthma history) and one cohort with both white and black participants (the NEST birth cohort). These three birth
cohorts will allow us to discover, replicate, and assess region and race specificity of DENs and their epidemiological
association with asthma incidence. For CpGs in modules of a network or networks showing association with
asthma incidence at one or more stages of life, we will evaluate the potential causality of the CpGs via Mendelian
randomization (MR) tests using the MR-base webtool. For the statistical methods to detect DENs, we will build the
method into a publicly available R package accompanied by a detailed manual with concrete examples."

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), affect more than
10 million people worldwide with steadily growing prevalence. Unfortunately, current IBD therapeutic approaches
fail to maintain long-term homeostatic immune tolerance. Thus, there remains an unmet clinical need for new
strategies that sustain immune tolerance in IBD. Rationale: Treatment with regulatory T cells (Tregs) is an
attractive strategy to promote immune tolerance in IBD. Among the Treg expansion therapies under
development, low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) is exciting because it preferentially targets Tregs with high-affinity
receptor IL-2RA, and it has shown some efficacy in patients with IBD and other diseases. However, IL-2 has a
narrow therapeutic window given that it also expands inflammatory T cells and myeloid cells. Other IL-2
limitations are that its therapeutic effect is restricted to expanding Tregs, and it does not limit Treg instability.
Therefore, identifying factors that synergistically boost Tregs while preventing any undesired action of low-dose
IL-2 on expanding inflammation is of high clinical significance. The programmed death 1 (PD1) pathway has
emerged as a critical inhibitory signal which controls T cell responses and maintains immune homeostasis.
Altered PD1 signaling can predispose mice and humans to autoimmunity. For example, PD1 blockade can cause
colitis in mice and humans. Recently, we identified that Smad7, a major molecule implicated in IBD, sustains
intestinal inflammation in mice by limiting PD1 signaling, thereby dampening PD1-induced Tregs. Given the
critical role of PD1 in limiting tissue inflammation, PD1 represents a therapeutic target of high clinical interest.
Preliminary findings: For this proposal, we began exploring PD1 agonism in human T cells. We found agonizing
PD1 via recombinant human PDL1-Fc and PDL2-Fc promotes de novo human Treg induction and limits Treg
plasticity. Interestingly, we also found that agonizing PD1 in myeloid cells inhibits inflammatory cytokines that
are known to promote Th1 and Th17 development and destabilize Tregs during IBD. In our effort to identify
factors that upregulate PD1, we found that IL-2 directly induces PD1 on human T cells. Excitingly, we found that
combination of low-dose IL-2 with PD1 agonist synergistically promotes human Tregs. Hypothesis: We will test
our hypothesis that PD1 agonist monotherapy could effectively restore immune tolerance by directly enhancing
Treg homeostasis while quenching effector T cell responses. Furthermore, we will investigate if combining low-
dose IL-2, which induces PD1 on T cells, with PDL1/2-Fc will synergistically boost Treg cells while restraining
undesired IL-2-induced inflammation to better treat IBD.
In Aim 1, we will test the translational relevance of PD1
agonist monotherapy and combination therapy with low-dose IL-2 by treating IBD patient immune cells in vitro.
In Aim 2, we will test the translational relevance of PD1 agonist monotherapy and combination therapy with low-
dose IL-2 by
treating translationally relevant humanized models of colitis. In summary, we will explore the
efficacy of a never tested PD1 agonist/low-dose IL-2 combination therapy in IBD."

The majority of licensed vaccines are thought to elicit protection mediated by humoral immunity. A key
determinant of the specificity and affinity of the antibody response is the germinal center (GC) response elicited
by immunization, wherein B cells enter GCs to undergo cyclic rounds of proliferation and somatic hypermutation
to evolve higher-affinity antibodies, followed by exit from the GC to become long-lived plasma cells or memory
B cells. Effective GC responses are thought to be critical for difficult pathogens such as HIV, and even for easily-
neutralized viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, effective and long-lived GC responses are associated with more
effective cross-neutralization of viral variants. Hence, optimizing GC responses is fundamental to vaccines
broadly. In recent work, we have studied how vaccine kinetics– the temporal pattern of antigen and adjuvant
exposure during immunization– impact humoral immunity and GC reaction in particular. Our preliminary studies
have revealed that prolonged delivery of antigen to draining lymph nodes over a period of 2-3 weeks substantially
alters the immune response. One particularly effective immunization approach, which we term “extended
dosing” (ext-dosing) immunization, involves administering a given total dose of vaccine antigen and adjuvant
as a half-dozen injections over two weeks in an escalating-dose pattern. Ext-dosing enhances the magnitude
of the GC response in both small and large animal models and increases the clonality (number of distinct B cell
clones participating in the GC), leading to enhanced neutralizing antibody production. These dramatic effects of
ext-dosing vaccination warrant close study to understand how and why this strategy is so effective. As ext-dosing
through repeat injections is not practical for human immunization, we are also highly motivated to develop
alternate strategies to achieve the same immunologic effects without the need for 6 or more injections. To
address these goals, our specific aims are (1) define how antigen exposure kinetics govern the immune
response elicited by ext-dosing immunization, (2) determine how adjuvant exposure kinetics impact the immune
response in ext-dosing, (3) test strategies to achieve “extended-dosing” effects using bolus subunit vaccine
administration, and (4) to evaluate the potential for ext-dosing-like effects in mRNA vaccines. Altogether, these
studies will both clarify fundamental concepts underlying effective primary immune responses and develop new
translationally-relevant approaches to enhance immune responses elicited by subunit and mRNA vaccines. We
test-bed these concepts using clinically-relevant antigens and adjuvants, and aim to pursue strategies we expect
to be broadly applicable to vaccines independent of disease target."
10881958,"Project Description
Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by null mutations in the dystrophin gene. CRISPR/Cas9
editing holds promise to treat DMD at its genetic root. Since DMD affects all muscles in the body, effective
therapy for DMD would require bodywide muscle delivery. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector is the only
delivery system that can efficiently reach all body muscles. For this reason, AAV has been the vector of choice
for CRISPR-mediated gene repair therapy for DMD. The AAV vector leads to persistent transgene expression.
Continuous Cas9 expression creates two problems. First, it increases the odds of off-target editing. Second,
the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the bacterial-derived Cas9 protein can eliminate the treated cells
and abolish the therapy. Many approaches have been developed to monitor off-target editing and improve
gene editing fidelity. However, it has been elusive to model the Cas9-specific CTL response. Mouse studies
revealed a limited cellular response that failed to eliminate Cas9 transduced cells. In fact, we and others have
observed nearly lifelong Cas9 expression, muscle pathology amelioration, and function improvement in mdx
mice, the most used mouse DMD model. In contrast to the mouse model, dystrophic canines are considered
better models for informing human trials. To determine whether Cas9 immunity is a hurdle for AAV-mediated
DMD CRISPR therapy, we performed a comprehensive study in four independent canine models (normal
canines and three different canine DMD models) using both Cas9 and non-Cas9 AAV vectors via local and
systemic delivery. We found compelling evidence suggesting that the Cas9, but not non-Cas9, AAV vector
induced a robust CTL response and eliminated gene-edited dystrophin-positive myofibers. Our studies
established a reliable model system to study Cas9 immunity. Importantly, it opens the door to developing and
validating strategies that may mitigate the Cas9-specific CTL response in a clinically relevant large animal
model. In this proposal, we will leverage our findings to explore novel strategies that may support persistent
therapeutic editing without inducing the CTL response in the canine DMD model. Our studies will pave the
way for translating AAV CRISPR therapy to DMD patients in the future. Our findings will also inform the
translation of AAV CRISPR therapy for other human diseases."
10854767,"Background: Prostate cancer (PCa) constitutes 30% of all new cancer diagnoses in the
Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and as such is the most frequently treated cancer among
Veterans. Those who are treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) often experience side effects
including erectile dysfunction (ED) and urinary incontinence (UI). The side effects of treatment often
persist for years and can contribute to anxiety and depression. Yoga, which includes breath work,
meditation, and physical poses, may be an effective intervention for treating side effects of RP. To
facilitate uptake and maximize its effectiveness, we propose to initiate the intervention prior to surgery
(prehabilitation) and deliver it using a blended approach (i.e., in-person and online sessions).
 Significance/Impact: The VHA provides care to half a million cancer survivors, of which
nearly half are PCa survivors. This number is expected to grow as the population ages and treatments
become more effective. It is therefore critical for the VHA to understand how best to enhance the
quality and length of survival of those diagnosed with cancer. Furthermore, the VHA and Health
Services Research and Development program recognize the importance of using a “Whole Health”
approach to supporting the health and well-being of Veterans. This intervention aligns with the
purpose of Whole Health by partnering with Veterans to create a personalized yoga plan based on
their own goals and needs.
 Innovation: The proposed intervention is innovative in several ways. First, it applies yoga to a
relatively new patient population (men with PCa) and sets of outcomes (ED and UI). Second, the
intervention is being tailored to the patient and delivered using a blended model. The first session is
in-person and used to tailor the yoga poses according to a Veteran's comfort and ability. Subsequent
sessions will take place online alongside ongoing patient cohorts. Third, the intervention includes a
prehabilitation component that aims to further dampen the side effects of RP.
 Specific Aims: The long-term goal of this research is to optimize the QoL and patient
experience for men with PCa. To that end, we seek to assess the feasibility of an innovative blended
(in-person and online) yoga program and to obtain preliminary data on its potential effectiveness in
alleviating PCa treatment symptom burden. The specific aims are to: 1) determine the feasibility
(including demand, safety and acceptability) of the intervention for men receiving a radical
prostatectomy; and 2) obtain preliminary data to estimate the potential impact of the intervention on
ED and UI (primary outcomes), well-being (e.g., cancer fatigue, stress, anxiety), and QoL.
 Methodology: For this pilot study, 30 Veterans who are undergoing a radical prostatectomy
for PCa treatment will be randomized to either the intervention or standard of care. The intervention is
a blended twice-weekly yoga program that includes a prehabilitation phase. ED and UI (primary
outcomes) as well as mental health well-being (e.g. stress, anxiety), including QoL (secondary
outcomes). Program uptake and attrition will be tracked and compared between groups. Baseline and
follow-up data on outcomes will be collected via survey. Safety will be closely monitored. Veterans'
experiences with and perceptions of the programs will be assessed through a post-intervention
survey.
 Next Steps/Implementation: We anticipate that the intervention will be feasible, safe, and
acceptable to Veterans and provide some evidence of potential efficacy. Subsequently, we intend to
fully evaluate the efficacy of the intervention while exploring its broader adaptation in VHA."
10851739,"The societal and patient-centered impacts of end-stage osteoarthritis (OA) among United States
Veterans are profound. More than 30% of Veterans in the VA healthcare system have OA which is significantly
higher than in the general population. VA treatment costs for OA are high, exceeding $880 million annually. Still,
apart from pain and symptom management and end stage surgical intervention, there are no effective therapeutic
treatments for OA. Despite prescribed rehabilitation post-surgery, Veterans who undergo total hip arthroplasty
(THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) experience profound deficits in health-related quality of life (HRQL),
severe limitations in activities of daily living, increased healthcare utilization, and higher incidence of
comorbidities. OA has a strong genetic component with heritability estimates >30%. Our research in the Million
Veteran Program (MVP) cohort led to discoveries in key areas. First, our ancestry specific and multi-ancestry
analyses in over 477,000 MVP and the UK Biobank (UKB) participants identified of novel genetic regions
associated with OA. Second, OA frequency was higher in the MVP than in our replication cohort (UKB) despite
using identical electronic health record diagnosis codes which may have hampered replication efforts. Third,
our research in the MVP cohort demonstrated a higher OA heritability in African American and Hispanic Veterans
than those of European White descent. Our overall goal is to identify pre- and post-rehabilitative biomarkers
to enhance physicians’ intuition for predicting patient prognosis for Veterans with OA and/or PTOA.
Toward this goal and to fill important knowledge gaps regarding the association of genetic factors with OA and
outcomes, in Aim 1, a) we will confirm genetic variants associated with OA prevalence and progression to end-
stage OA as well as b) develop and evaluate the performance of a polygenic risk score (PRS) to identify Veterans
at risk of progression to total hip/knee joint arthroplasty; in Aim 2, we will identify genetic variants prognostic of
THA/TKA recovery; and in Aim 3, we will determine whether genetic variants associated with the development
of post-traumatic OA (PTOA) are distinct from known genetic determinants of idiopathic OA. We will identify
biomarkers to enable targeted, precision pre-habilitation and post-surgical rehabilitation strategies improving
mobility function, HRQL, and healthcare utilization among Veterans with OA."
10843258,"SUMMARY: Despite substantial progress in clinical approaches to squamous cancer of the esophagus (ESCC),
which causes most esophageal cancers (EC) in the world, this deadly tumor usually occurs at late disease
stages, with very poor survival. Restricted availability of endoscopy (EGD), along with rarity and delays in
histology, impairs detection of ESCC in LMICs, adversely impacting our ability to treat this disease effectively.
Thus, in LMICs, inexpensive, safe, locally performable strategies for detecting ESCC are necessary to identify
high-risk patients and refer them quickly to suitable diagnostic and therapeutic options.
Therefore, a diagnostic approach featuring a retrievable swallowed sponge-on-a-string to gather esophageal
specimens for molecular testing, combined with a point-of-care (POC) magnetofluidic chip for sample processing
and DNA methylation detection, is proposed. The string-sponge is less expensive, more noninvasive, more
convenient, and more rapid than EGD with biopsy. The magnetofluidic chip streamlines DNA purification, DNA
bisulphite treatment, and PCR detection of methylation markers into a single POC apparatus. This approach
does not necessitate EGD, can be performed in remote areas with portable energy supplies and does not require
extensive medical training, and is thereby amenable to implementation in LMICs.
Our Specific Aims are: 1: Using a sponge-capsule swallowed/tethered collection device, to construct a
methylation marker-based strategy to detect ESCC. In 100 ESCC and 100 benign control patients, we
propose (1) building a multivariate model containing biomarker candidates; (2) carrying out feedback-feasibility
meetings with health care and endoscopy personnel at Makerere University Hospitals to fine-tune eventual POC
usage; 2: In order to achieve a sample-to-answer assay, to implement DNA extraction, bisulfite treatment,
and methylation-specific PCR into a magnetofluidic chip with dried reagents. We’ll use magnetofluidic
techniques to streamline cell lysis, DNA extraction, bisulphite treatment, and methylation-specific PCR into a
compact chip built from cheap thermoplastic materials. In addition, we’ll lyophilize reagents and use heat-
deployed wax sealant plugs to permit storage at room temperature. In this fashion, we will fashion a sample-to-
answer assay that is easy to use, inexpensive, and free of cold-chain steps; 3: In order to achieve fully
automatic high-speed biomarker assaying, to design a small, light apparatus. We’ll engineer an instrument
containing programmable magnetic actuation, temperature control, and detection of fluorescence to execute the
test in a chip with very little user input. We’ll also design the apparatus to be small, light, easy to operate, portable
electricity-powered, and mobile phone-controlled to ease integration with LMIC-based clinical tasking; and 4:
Using our POC approach to carry out a diagnostic pilot study of ESCC in Uganda. While applying the
magnetofluidic chip and apparatus used in Aim 2 and Aim 3, we’ll carry out a trial to measure specificity and
sensitivity in 120 EGD-confirmed cases of ESCC and 360 benign disease control patients in Kampala, Uganda."
10812426,"Project Summary/Abstract
This goal of this project is to design and optimize an equitable and value-based approach to baseline testing
for sports-related concussion by synthesizing machine learning and systems science methods. Concussion,
one of the most common types of traumatic brain injury, afflicts upwards of 3.6 million people annually and is a
major public health issue. Timely and effective concussion management is considered a major factor in
mitigating both short-term and long-term consequences of the injury. Baseline testing is a widely used practice
that provides physicians and athletic trainers a reference point indicating someone’s “normal” performance
across several concussion-specific functional domains. Baseline testing is also a resource-intensive process,
requiring specific expertise in the time-consuming administration of a multi-dimensional concussion
assessment battery; nevertheless, baseline testing is considered essential to the injury management process
for those at elevated risk of concussion, including student-athletes and military personnel. Despite widespread
use of baseline testing, there is a lack of evidence-based guidance on who should be prioritized for baseline
testing in resource-limited environments.
The multidisciplinary research team aims to address this knowledge gap by synthesizing machine learning and
systems science methods with data from the Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education Consortium –
one of the largest multi-site datasets available on sports-related concussion. Specifically, the project aims to
first use interpretable machine learning methods and statistical modeling to estimate the diagnostic utility of
baseline testing in a heterogeneous cohort of student-athletes. Next, the project aims to design a decision-
analytic model that can optimally allocate baseline tests. This model will take into account: (1) personalized
estimates for the diagnostic utility of baseline tests, (2) individualized risk for sport-related concussion, (3)
resource constraints at a given institution, and (4) equity considerations in the allocation of baseline tests. This
research can transform how clinicians, athletic trainers, and other trained medical staff approach baseline
testing and concussion diagnosis for those who may be under-represented in the development of existing
clinical guidelines, leading to more timely and accurate diagnosis of concussion. Moreover, resources saved
through an efficient allocation of baseline tests can be reallocated to other valuable tasks performed by
specialized medical personnel, including other tasks along the concussion care continuum, heat illnesses
prevention, and COVID-19 screening."
10805464,"Project Summary
Angiogenesis is a complex and tightly regulated process essential for tissue repair in response to injury or
disease. In the adult human brain, the cerebrovasculature is largely quiescent but angiogenesis is associated
with disease (e.g. stroke, neurodegenerative disease, and brain cancer), wound healing (e.g. traumatic brain
injury), and physiological factors (e.g. exercise, high altitude adaptation, etc.). In the generally accepted model
of brain angiogenesis, when blood vessels are exposed to angiogenic cues, pericytes detach from activated
endothelial cells and are passive bystanders during sprout formation and growth, only migrating back to surround
the newly formed endothelium in the maturation phase. However, a few studies in humans and animal models
have reported that pericytes can play an active role in angiogenesis, leading sprout growth and promoting the
migration of stalk cells.
The objective of this project is to identify the role of pericytes during angiogenesis in the brain. Our major
hypothesis is that pericytes can be selectively activated to become the tip cells and lead the growth of angiogenic
sprouts. The objective will be addressed in three aims. In Aim 1, we will use a tissue-engineered post-capillary
venule model to assess the role of hypoxia and growth factor gradients on pericyte-guided angiogenesis. In Aim
2, we will evaluate the transcriptomic profile of pericytes during angiogenesis. Immunostaining and in situ RNA
hybridization will be used to examine key markers of tip cells as well as to validate key sequencing results. In
Aim 3, we will perform a proof-of-concept experiment to test the hypothesis that gene editing can be used to
engineer tip cell phenotype. Understanding the role of pericytes in adult brain angiogenesis is important in
understanding the response to the cerebrovasculature to a wide range of perturbations and will enable the
development of new therapies for cerebrovascular repair."

Heterogeneity within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment is well defined and we
hypothesize may contribute to the wide range of phenotypes emerging from initiation of clonal
hematopoiesis (CH). This project will use distinctive tools for assessing cell state in the context
of Tet2 deletion to determine how the epigenetic and transcriptional program of the cell of origin
affects clonal dominance. These data will provide insight into the mechanisms of clonal
dominance and may offer epigenetic signatures indicative of risk for subsequent validation. We
will also focus on the metabolic state of dominant CH to define whether features of those cells
render them vulnerable to low intensity intervention. Successful accomplishment will guide
strategies for selective depletion of aberrant dominant clones."
10840866,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Hematopoiesis has been considered an ordered process of blood cell formation from a strict hierarchy;
however, it is now clear that intrinsic and extrinsic cellular forces influence a complex cellular ecosystem of
differentiation. While recurrent mutations cause cell autonomous disruptions in pre-leukemic settings like clonal
hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), clonal selection is also
dependent on extrinsic forces in the microenvironment like inflammation. In this context, understanding how
perturbations in pre-malignant clones respond to pro-inflammatory factors becomes fundamental in therapeutic
advancement. Our project seeks to establish a molecular and cellular framework for characterization of clonal
and inflammatory hematopoiesis at single-cell resolution. We have found that alterations in mature innate
immune cells contribute to a perturbed inflammatory environment, and more specifically factors that promote
clonal expansion of CHIP mutant clones through differential activation of intracellular signlaing. Based on our
preliminary data, we propose that this unique cytokine signaling network mediates cellular function and more so
cellular metabolism specifically in mutant stem cells. The same activation in wild-type stem cells promotes
differentiation and proliferation, with loss of stemness. Our research identified Signal Transducer And Activator
Of Transcription 3 (STAT3) as one of the major intracellular signals mediating CHIP clonal function. In ongoing
studies, we will to define STAT3 specific mechanisms of clonal cell maintenance. We propose to define how
cytokine signaling pathways mediate clonal expansion (Aim 1). We will characterize the function and
transcriptional characteristics of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells using CHIP mutant pre-clinical models
following induction and perturbation to define the molecular drivers for maintenance of transformed
hematopoietic stem cells during inflammation (Aim 2). These experiments will define new regulatory networks
by establishing and linking cytokine to active signaling and cellular metabolism. These results will provide the
basis for studies to understand how inflammation during clonal hematopoiesis regulates mitochondrial
metabolism for a selective advantage. These findings will allow us to exploit these interactions to impede pre-
malignant clones by altering the marrow microenvironment and targeting signaling axis and cellular metabolism
(Aim 3). Moving forward, these findings could lead to therapeutic interventions for improved cellular response
mitigating CHIP and changing outcomes in hematological disease."
10840870,"ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic clonal imbalance predisposes individuals to hematopoietic disorders, some progressing to
myelodysplasia. During aging, mutations arise that lead to clonal dominance. In transplantation or gene therapy
trials, clonal alterations complicate therapy. Somatic genetic mutation(s) may bestow a selective growth
advantage to a single hematopoietic stem cell so that it will eventually outgrow normal (wild type, WT) cells
causing clonal imbalance. Early detection of such cells is key to therapeutically intervene to block progression
to a blood disorder. The Zebrabow zebrafish allows color barcoding and tracking of individual hematopoietic
stem cells during differentiation into peripheral blood cells in vivo. A recently developed technique called TWISTR
allows mosaic targeting of genes in the Zebrabow genetic background. Without the need for transplantation, a
robust competition assay between WT and single gene mutant hematopoietic stem cells can be monitored using
the color-based cellular barcoding TWISTR system. The dominant clone can be sorted via flow cytometry and
compared to non-dominant clones for downstream analysis. Mosaic mutagenesis of ASXL1 leads to clonal
dominance, and we found that inhibition of the NR4A1 anti-inflammatory pathway using CRISPR or chemical
inhibition restores clonal balance. Using metabolomics, we have found that choline metabolism is altered in
dominant asxl1 mutant clones. In Aim 1, pharmacologic experiments will be performed to evaluate the NR4A1
pathway in facilitating clonal dominance and genetic experiments targeting choline-related metabolic genes will
identify metabolic targets for suppressing clonal dominance. We also found that macrophages play a role in stem
cell clonality through physical interactions with hematopoietic stem cells. Macrophages interact with the “eat me”
signal, Calreticulin, on the surface of hematopoietic stem cells to determine their fate. In Aim 2, we plan to
evaluate mutants of Calreticulin orthologs and examine the effects on clonality. We plan to probe the mechanism
of the induced clone expansion after macrophage interactions. We also have undertaken a chemical genetic
screen to find inducers of Calreticulin on the surface of zebrafish and human hematopoietic stem and progenitor
cells and will study specific compounds that can induce an “eat-me” signal for dominant clones. Our studies will
have an impact on the basic understanding of clonal balance and will lead to potential therapies for clonal
dominance."
10851708,"SUMMARY
 Human ISG15 is a ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) that functions in innate immune responses, and it is
remarkable for possessing three distinct biochemical activities. As a ubiquitin-like modifier it is conjugated to
hundreds of cellular and viral proteins. The E1, E2, E3, and de-conjugating enzymes for ISG15 (Ube1L/Uba7,
UbcH8/Ube2L6, Herc5, and Usp18, respectively), are, like ISG15, induced at the transcriptional level by Type I
interferon (IFN-α/β) signaling. A second function of ISG15 is as an extracellular signaling protein. ISG15 is
released into the extracellular space from many cell types and signals to Natural Killer and T cells to secrete
IFN-γ, which plays a major role in the response to pathogen infections. The cell surface receptor for
extracellular SG15 is LFA-1, an immune cell-specific integrin. A third function of human ISG15 is that it
negatively regulates Type I IFN signaling, as revealed by the Type I interferonopathy that occurs in some
ISG15-deficient patients; this function of human ISG15 is not shared with mouse ISG15. A challenge in the
field is to understand how the activities of ISG15 are regulated and temporally controlled and which activities
are most closely associated with responses to specific pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and
SARS-CoV-2. To further our understanding of ISG15 in innate immune responses to these and other
pathogens, this proposal will focus on the basis of substrate and lysine selectivity of the Herc5/Herc6 family of
ISG15 ligases, the ISG15-induced signaling pathway downstream of LFA-1 that leads to cytokine secretion,
and the mechanism by which ISG15 released into the extracellular space."
10813068,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overarching goal of this project is to quantify the temporal kinetics of T-cell activation and infiltration
during novel combination intratumoral oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) immunotherapy with advanced
molecular immuno- positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in preclinical models of glioblastoma (GBM).
Novel targeted oHSV immunotherapy has been shown to directly kill GBM tumor cells as the virus selectively
replicates within and lyses malignantly transformed cells, however there is a knowledge gap in understanding
the kinetics of the immune cell changes and how to harness those changes to improve therapeutic efficacy. As
inflammation and pseudo progression are key characteristics of immunotherapy-induced tumor changes,
standard imaging methods fail to provide reliable response assessments, which can sometimes take up to six
months to reveal through clinical changes in tumor size. Advanced quantitative imaging strategies can provide
spatial and temporal information on biological alterations prior to the clinically observed, downstream changes
in tumor size. Immuno- PET imaging could stratify selection of patients who pursue immunotherapy and guide
the timing and sequencing of combinatorial therapies. We have preliminary data showing that there are
differential responses in CD8 expression in gliomas during oHSV therapy and that oHSV increases CD8
infiltration, as we can image these changes with PET. Further, preliminary evidence shows that granzyme B
increases (as measured by GZP-PET) are related to overall tumor response. The overarching hypothesis is PET
molecular imaging can guide targeted IL-12 and IL-18 oHSV to enhance therapeutic efficacy and extend survival
in preclinical models of GBM. There are three specific aims to answer this hypothesis: Aim 1. Using advanced
molecular immunoPET in GBM murine models with biological validation, determine if early T-cell kinetics of
infiltration and activation are increased following oHSV therapy alone, or with oHSV expressing IL-12 and/or IL-
18. We will quantify longitudinal alterations in T-cell infiltration with [89Zr]-CD8-PET imaging of CD8+ cells and
quantify longitudinal alterations in T-cell activation (granzyme B) with [68Ga]-GZP-PET imaging. Aim 2. Using
advanced molecular immunoPET in GBM murine models, determine if secondary therapeutics (radiation therapy,
or immunomodulatory immune checkpoint inhibitors) used in combination with oHSV IOT produce increased
intermediate term T cell infiltration and activation and improve long-term tumor response. Aim 3. Determine if
secondary boosts of oHSV IOT during imaging-identified timing windows of decreased T cell infiltration and
activation can salvage therapeutic response. ImmunoPET imaging allows longitudinal quantification of
underlying immunological kinetics during oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) immunotherapy (IOT) that will
allow optimization of therapeutic regimens on a personalized basis."
10866585,"Sexual minority women experience alarmingly high rates of mental health problems, including anxiety
disorders, depression, and suicidality, which are significantly higher than those of both heterosexual women
and sexual minority men. The overarching goals of this project are to address these mental health disparities
and advance our ability to prevent and treat mental illness among sexual minority women by conducting an
innovative, longitudinal study of mental health in young sexual minority women. Building upon the largest ever
longitudinal cohort study of young sexual minority women, which includes seven waves of data collected over 3
years from 390 racially diverse participants (ages 16-20 at baseline), we will collect an additional six waves of
data over 2.5 years (starting at ages 21-26) with expanded measurement of mental health, risk and protective
factors, and mechanisms of effect. We have four specific aims: (1) Model trajectories of sexual minority
women’s mental health, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality across late adolescence and early
adulthood (16-28 years), and explore demographic differences in these patterns (e.g., by race, gender
identity). (2) Grounded in minority stress theory, rigorously test unique stigma-based risk factors for mental
health among sexual minority women. (3) Explore biological, psychological, and social/interpersonal
mechanisms through which minority stress negatively affects sexual minority women’s mental health.
Specifically, we will test whether stress-sensitive inflammatory processes (C- reactive protein, IL-6, IL-10,
TNFa), maladaptive emotion regulation and cognitive processes (e.g., rumination; hopelessness), and
impaired social processes (social isolation; romantic relationship functioning) mediate associations between
minority stress and mental health. (4) Identify individual, community, and interpersonal protective factors that
buffer sexual minority women from adverse mental health effects of minority stress. Across aims, the project
focuses on identifying mutable factors that can be targeted in interventions and are relevant to today’s young

A seizure is an abnormal neural activity in the brain and the main characteristic of epilepsy. About one-third of
the patients have seizures resistant to anti-epileptic medication and therefore, an alternative treatment is
necessary. Recent studies show that neurons can be recruited and seizures can propagate by a mechanism
known as electric field coupling. Our laboratory has shown that canceling the electric field in the extracellular
space can prevent neural propagation and recruitment. We now propose to develop a novel neurotechnology
that not only can control the propagation of seizures but prevent the seizure from being generated by controlling
the extracellular electric field. With a combined methodology of in-vitro electrophysiology with state-of-the-art
neural imaging, computer modeling and in-vivo preparations in rodents, we will implement the seizure control
system and study its mechanism with four specific aims: 1) Prevent neuronal synchronization in hyperexcitable
neural tissue, 2) Develop a novel technology of extracellular voltage clamp to control seizures in-vivo, 3)
Determine the mechanisms of seizure control by an extracellular voltage clamp system, 4) Determine the role of
the extracellular space in the clamping efficiency. Current electrical responsive control therapy detects a seizure
and then applies stimulation. The proposed neurotechnology will prevent the synchronization between neurons
to stop the generation of seizures before they arise at very low current amplitude thereby providing a novel
therapeutic paradigm for treating epilepsy."

Although the impact of developmental language disorder (DLD), a prevalent preschool disorder, can be
mitigated through evidence-based and early interventions, little is known about the neural basis of DLD,
especially in young children, yet is useful in the design of efficacious treatments. While much of the evidence
has been furnished by studies examining domain-specific processes (language network), domain-general
processes relating memory and language also offer valuable testing ground and present the opportunity to
advance the current knowledge base. The Procedural circuit Deficit Hypothesis (PDH) posits that grammar
deficits are explained by an impairment of procedural memory (rule learning, “knowing how”). This impairment
is associated with structural abnormalities in connections between frontal brain regions and basal ganglia, with
corresponding underactivation and reduced functional connectivity. However, the declarative memory system
(semantic, “knowing what”), supported by cortical and subcortical regions in the temporal lobes, including
hippocampus, is spared, acting as a compensatory mechanism to offset grammar deficits.
 This proposed research will use neuroimaging (functional MRI and diffusion imaging) to describe the
neural basis (functional and structural connectivity) of grammar learning and treatment-related change by way
of the PDH. We will gather critical data regarding grammar learning in preschoolers with DLD before, after, and
following a break in intervention (computer-assisted treatment: DLD treatment; “business as usual”: DLD no
treatment) as part of a randomized controlled trial. We will also include typically developing (TD) peers to
inform development vs disorder. Our central hypothesis is that treatment designed to improve grammar
learning will normalize the procedural learning network in association with increases in language function and
that the degree of improvement may be associated with the underlying neurobiology of baseline grammar
deficits.
 Building on a robust history of recruitment and treatment of preschoolers with DLD, we will enroll 184
preschoolers, 100 with DLD (n=50 treatment; n=50 no treatment controls) and 84 TD. Aim 1 will establish the
relationship between functional and structural connectivity for preschoolers with DLD and their TD peers
between regions in the procedural learning and declarative networks. In Aim 2, we will establish the
neurobiological basis of treatment-related changes in DLD only. We examine potential changes in functional
and structural connectivity between regions of the procedural learning and declarative memory networks, and
investigate whether treatment-related changes occur into the typical range (DLD and TD). To meet our
scientific goals, we pair behavioral tools (traditional grammar tools) with neuroimaging to describe co-occurring
behavioral performance underlying learning and outcome. This research will contribute novel insights into
mechanisms underlying learning and impairment to help advance the evidence-based management of DLD."

A strategic priority for contemporary HIV vaccine research is the development of approaches to elicit broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) able to neutralize diverse strains of the virus. A cornerstone of bNAb discovery
is the ability to conduct accurate, longitudinal studies of antibody evolution in HIV infected individual as they gain
mutations and acquire neutralization activity. Currently, it is not possible to perform analogous antibody evolution
tracing studies using rhesus macaques (RMs), due to a lack of defined immunoglobulin (IG) alleles. This is best
exemplified by a recent study large scale vaccine study by our group in which we sequenced a de novo genome
of a RM using long-read sequencing in order to obtain accurate assemblies of the IG loci. This reference
significantly enhanced the accuracy of tracking the mutations from germline elicited by our vaccine strategies.
This tool was critical in deciphering trajectories that led to either autologous neutralization or immunodominance
and non-neutralizing responses. In other work, we have developed novel bioinformatics methodology (germline
inference) to identify the unmutated germline antibody sequence from immunoglobulin repertoire. This work has
led to identification of hundreds of novel inferred IG alleles.
The goal of this R24 proposal is to build on these findings by characterizing the IG alleles and haplotypes
in AIDS designated RMs at NHP primate centers that serve the major HIV vaccine stakeholders. Currently,
the IG loci are poorly characterized in RMs, in part due to technical challenges. IG genotypes are not currently
used as criteria when enrolling RMs into vaccine studies. In contrast, MHC genotyping of RMs has become
standard practice for vaccine studies and is a core function in genetic management of NPRC RM colonies. The
lack of genetic data on the RM IG loci is therefore a significant knowledge gap and impairs our ability to assess
the evolution of antibodies in monkeys administered vaccines that aim to elicit neutralizing antibodies. The goal
of this R24 proposal is to address this strategic need and build a resource in which this genetic information (IG
allele sequence information, haplotype, and allele usage) is available to the HIV vaccine and NHP research
communities."
10814947,"Biliary liver diseases, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), are characterized by the damage and
proliferation of cholangiocytes that are a key link between biliary injury and the subepithelial fibrosis, manifesting
chronic hepatobiliary injury that represents a major clinical challenge. Whereas biliary senescence and
inflammatory damage are crucial to the pathogenesis of biliary liver injury, there are significant gaps in
understanding the precise mechanisms of ductular reaction and liver fibrosis. Recent evidence demonstrates
stimulator of interferon genes (STING) as a mediator that promotes macrophage-stimulated liver inflammation
and fibrosis. In various cell types, STING is activated by cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), whose synthesis is
catalyzed by cGAMP synthase (cGAS) in response to the aberrant cytosolic presence of double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA), including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). During the preliminary studies, we obtained exciting data
suggesting the following novel findings: 1) STING expression is increased in cholangiocytes, liver macrophages,
and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in livers of PSC patients; 2) cholangiocyte- and/or myeloid cell-specific STING
disruption alleviates ductular reaction and liver fibrosis during cholestasis; 3) while mtDNA is increased in
cholangiocytes from cholestatic mice, extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from human PSC cholangiocytes
promote macrophage activation in a manner involving STING; and 4) STING-driven macrophage factors
increase cholangiocyte expression of genes related to senescence-associated secretory phonotype (SASP) and
fibrosis. These findings point to a critical role for STING in regulating cholangiocyte damage and dysfunctional
cell-cell crosstalk during biliary liver injury. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that during cholestatic liver
injury, STING expression/activation is stimulated in cholangiocytes, liver macrophages, and HSCs through
autocrine and paracrine manners via EVs containing mtDNA cargo, which in turn results in dysfunctional cell-
cell crosstalk to enhance cholangiocyte SASP, macrophage/HSC activation, and consequent ductular reaction
and liver fibrosis. To test the central hypothesis, two Specific Aims will be persued. For Aim 1, experiments
involving novel mouse models have been proposed to determine the extent to which cholangiocyte-specific
STING disruption alleviates cholestatic-induced ductular reaction and liver fibrosis. Also, cell experiments will be
performed to determine the extent to which STING-driven cholangiocyte factors promote macrophage
proinflammatory activation and HSC fibrogenic activation. For Aim 2, experiments have been designed to
determine the extent to which myeloid cell-specific STING disruption alleviates cholestasis-induced ductular
reaction, cholangiocyte SASP, and liver fibrosis in mice. Also, cell experiments will be performed to evaluate the
extent to which STING-driven macrophage factors promote cholangiocyte SASP and HSC fibrogenic activation.
Successful completion of this project will fill knowledge gaps in biliary liver injury and provide the experimental
basis for innovative therapeutic strategies based on STING inhibition."

Myopia is a refractive error type of eye disorder where light is focused in front of the retina, requiring optical
corrections to recover the resulting loss in visual acuity. It is a broadly significant health condition: it is estimated
that by 2050 50% of the world population will be myopic. Moreover, even if myopia is compensated with
spectacles, contact lenses or surgery, high myopia is linked to a higher risk of retinal detachment, glaucoma,
and cataract. Strategies to halt the progression of myopia are therefore an urgent need. Myopia arises from a
mismatch between ocular axial length and optical power, but the signals that prompt excessive eye growth are
not well understood. Among various strategies developed for myopia control, the use of multifocal contact lenses
(MCL) is gaining significant traction. A generalized working principle behind MCL design is that induced myopic
defocus in the peripheral retina is protective for foveal axial growth. Initial clinical trials report encouraging
reduction of myopia progression in children fitted with MCLs (generally, center-distance and high add powers)
however they are still far from the desired effectiveness. Unlike MCL for presbyopia, MCLs for myopia control
are prescribed on subjects that can accommodate. However, we currently do not have a good understanding of
how accommodation interacts with MCLs in determining retinal image quality. This is a critical gap in knowledge
as accommodation affects the very central feature of MCL design — the degree and the sign of retinal defocus.
For example, depending on MCL design and individual physiological parameters, some subjects could rely on
the near zones of the MCL for near vision, potentially exposing the retina to hyperopic defocus and triggering
eye growth. We, a diverse team of optical engineers, physicists and neuroscientists will make use of adaptive
optics simulation technologies and psychophysical paradigms to map non-invasively MCL lens patterns onto the
subject’s pupil and systematically address key outstanding questions on the interplay between MCL design,
accommodation, image quality and visual function with MCLs in young myopes. The group has previously
developed adaptive optics technologies to test presbyopia corrections, novel methods based on wavefront
sensing to quantify the accommodative response, IOL designs for presbyopia and psychophysical paradigms
suited for young subjects. We are now using these capabilities, expanded to binocular simulation and testing, to
understand factors underlying accommodative and binocular mechanisms of MCL-based interventions to slow
down myopia. The long-term goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding that can help guide the design and
personalization of MCL myopia control interventions. We plan to 1) determine the accommodative response
with multifocal patterns in young myopes and emmetropes, 2) quantify the effects of various multifocal designs
on foveal visual function and 3) test the role of accommodative response on the outcome success in children
that have been clinically treated with multifocal contact lenses"

This proposal seeks to develop a microscope capable of live imaging with 80 nm lateral resolution through the
development of Three-dimensional Nonlinear Structured Illumination Microscopy. Single Molecule
Localization Microscopy can offer unprecedented resolution down to 10 nm but requires 10,000 to 100,000
raw images and, therefore, is not amenable to fast live imaging. Stimulated Emission Depletion Microscopy can
achieve ~ 50 nm resolution in live cells and rapid imaging over small (~1 µm2) fields of view but because it is a
point scanning technique becomes too slow when the field of view increases. STED also requires high
intensities reducing its attractiveness for live imaging. RESOLFT microscopy and associated techniques have
shown promising results, achieving ~ 80 nm resolution in live samples but are also slow because they require
lateral sample scanning. Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) is an attractive approach for live super-
resolution imaging because it requires relatively few raw images, no lateral scanning of the sample is required,
and the excitation intensity can be low. Linear SIM can achieve ~ 120 nm resolution and live imaging has been
demonstrated in both two dimensions and three dimensions with the fastest frame rates for 2D SIM over 50
frames per second. Nonlinear SIM can theoretically achieve unlimited resolution and imaging with 40 nm
resolution has been demonstrated in two dimensions. Live two-dimensional NSIM has been demonstrated at
2.8 frames per second with 62 nm resolution.
Three-dimensional Nonlinear SIM has yet to be demonstrated. The development of live 3D NSIM with 2D
frame rates exceeding 4 frames per second will fill a need for high-resolution live imaging over large fields of
view up to ~ 100 µm × 100 µm, allowing cellular structures such as filopodia, vesicles, and mitochondria to be
resolved in three-dimensions. To accomplish this we will develop a new Structured Illumination Pattern
generator optical design and novel Adaptive Optics Techniques to achieve the best optical performance
allowing fast aberration-free imaging in cells and thin tissue sections."

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the developed world, and its incidence and
mortality rate are increasing due, in part, to the obesity epidemic. Obesity dramatically increases the risk of death
from endometrial cancer, and there are a variety of systemic changes that occur in the obese state that create a
milieu that favors tumor initiation and progression. One of these factors, hyperinsulinemia, has been directly
implicated in the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer, and may underlie the strong association of obesity with
tumor progression in this cancer type. Insulin stimulates PI3K to drive cell growth, proliferation, and anti-apoptotic
pathways. Unfortunately, PI3K inhibitors have not been effective in clinical trials for endometrial cancer. Using
pre-clinical models, we identified hyperinsulinemia as an acute, systemic, drug-induced adaptation that limits the
efficacy of these drugs. This adverse effect can be mitigated in animal models using dietary and pharmacologic
approaches that target the endocrine system. In this proposal, we will test if these strategies can be translated
to clinical care using patient-derived tumor tissue, mouse xenograft models, and tissues from clinical intervention
trials. We hypothesize that lowering insulin will reduce tumor markers of PI3K signaling, increase markers of
apoptosis, and enhance the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors in patients with endometrial cancer. In Aim 1, we will
examine the effects of a very low carbohydrate diet (VLCD) on endometrial cancer signaling and growth using
patient-derived blood and tumor tissue from two ongoing clinical studies where patients are consuming a VLCD
with and without a PI3K inhibitor. We will assess genetic, histologic, and biochemical markers of the Insulin/PI3K
pathway, proliferation, and apoptosis. In Aim 2, we will use patient-derived xenograft models to identify novel
pharmacologic strategies that lower systemic insulin levels and enhance the apoptotic response to PI3K
inhibition. Specifically, we will assess the systemic insulin response and tumor growth rates in mice treated with
PI3K inhibitors and 2 endocrine therapies: canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor that prevents
hyperglycemia, and diazoxide, a potassium channel activator that prevents hyperinsulinemia. Our data will
provide robust pre-clinical evidence to support combination strategies that target insulin to limit the progression
of endometrial cancer. If successful, these dietary and pharmacologic interventions can be rapidly implemented
into clinical practice."

Through our multidisciplinary clinical and research collaboration, we have established a rare cohort of children and
adolescents who fulfilled the 2016 adult Sjögren’s disease (SjD) criteria (namely, cSjD for childhood Sjögren’s
disease). Since autoimmune SjD typically affects elderly females, whether cSjD is a unique disease entity or an early
manifestation of SjD is completely unknown. The overall goal is to characterize mechanisms by which mitochondrial
dsRNAs (mtdsRNA) are released into the cytoplasm and activate the cytosolic dsRNA sensor, protein kinase R (PKR),
for the proinflammatory signature found in cSjD CD14+ monocytes. Our preliminary data from scRNA-seq of cSjD
monocytes revealed the aberrant expression of mtdsRNA processors, such as SUV3 (ATP-dependent RNA helicase,
suppressor of variegation 3, SUPV3L1 gene) and PNPase (polyribonucleotide nucleotidyltransferase, PNPT1 gene),
PKR, type I IFN signature (I-IFN), STAT1, and CD52. A higher percentage of cSjD monocytes were positive for
particulate cytoplasmic dsRNA with downregulated SUV3 and upregulated PNPase when compared to healthy control
monocytes. SUV3-deficient cell lines concurred consistently with cytoplasmic mtdsRNA accumulation, PKR activation,
and ISG induction. In addition, we found mitochondrial RNA binding proteins (mtRBPs) crucial in maintaining
mtdsRNA stability within the matrix and novel endogenous short duplex RNAs (e-sdRNA) bound to PKR, which may
sequester PKR as a monomer to prevent its activation. Furthermore, our scRNA-seq data of PBMC clearly pinpoint
CD52 downregulation detected only in cSjD monocytes compared to monocytes from other pediatric groups or adult
SjD. Therefore, we propose our novel central hypothesis that defective mtdsRNA degradation by the aberrant SUV3
and PNPase expression in the mitochondria leads to cytoplasmic mtdsRNA accumulation, which activates the
cytosolic dsRNA sensor, PKR, in cSjD monocytes. The three proposed aims included: Aim 1. Characterize PKR
sensing of mtdsRNA in cSjD monocytes. We will determine if PKR is the key cytosolic sensor for autologous
mtdsRNAs in I-IFN+CD14+cSjD Mo and if novel e-sdRNAs bound to PKR regulate its activation. Aim 2. Identify
molecules involved in impaired mtdsRNA degradation and release into the cytoplasm. We will identify the
impact of upregulated PNPase in cSjD Mo by hypothesizing that PNPase overexpression amplifies PKR activation
through the degradation of e-sdRNAs bound to PKR. Additionally, novel mtRBPs will be tested to determine if they
permit mtdsRNA to escape into the cytoplasm by altering the methylation status of mitochondrial transcripts. Aim 3.
Stratify biological and clinical features of cSjD for precision medicine. We will test if the downregulation of anti-
inflammatory, anti-adhesion CD52 in cSjD Mo is mediated by the mtdsRNA-PKR-STAT1 pathway to enhance
extravasation through endothelial cells for tissue homing. We will also stratify transcriptomic, immunological, genetic,
molecular, clinical, and laboratory features of cSjD by expanding our ongoing scRNA-seq of PBMC and paired biopsy
tissues, and RNA-seq of Mo for validation. Our novel mechanistic studies on mtdsRNA, along with NGS, will lead to
cSjD molecular barcodes and pertinent RNA therapy involving e-sdRNAs to dampen PKR activation in cSjD."

Type III interferons (IFN-λ) play a key role eliciting antiviral immunity at epithelial surfaces, controlling infections
locally without the inflammatory immune pathology triggered by the more potent systemic type I IFN (IFN-αβ)
response. However, the effects of IFN-λ in the skin have not been extensively investigated. Herpes simplex virus
type 1 (HSV-1) infects epithelial cells and establishes a life-long infection in sensory neurons. Using a mouse
skin infection model, we found that multiple lines of mice lacking IFN-λ signaling developed more severe HSV-1
skin lesions compared to wild-type mice. However, disease severity was uncoupled from viral loads in the skin,
suggesting a role for IFN-λ in suppressing inflammatory immune pathology. We found that IFN-λ signaling in
both keratinocytes and leukocytes was necessary for protection from severe skin disease and that Ifnlr1-/- mice
exhibited greater neutrophil infiltration into HSV-1 skin lesions compared to WT mice. We hypothesize that IFN-
λ protects against inflammatory pathology during HSV-1 infection by suppressing neutrophil recruitment and
activation. The greatest burden of HSV-1 disease in humans results from reactivation of lifelong latent infections,
rather than new infections. We have developed a simple and tractable mouse model to induce reactivation of
latent HSV-1 from dorsal root ganglia which produces recurrent HSV-1 skin lesions. Using this model, we found
that Ifnlr1-/- mice develop more severe reactivation disease compared to WT mice. Flaviviruses and other
arboviruses are inoculated into the skin by blood-feeding mosquito or tick vectors. We found that IFN-λ signaling
reduced viremia caused by Zika virus and Langat virus only when the viruses were inoculated in the skin, not
when the skin barrier was bypassed by subcutaneous inoculation. Vector saliva is known to enhance arbovirus
pathogenesis in part by recruiting neutrophils, a key IFN-λ responsive cell type. We hypothesize that IFN-λ
signaling in the skin restricts flavivirus dissemination and that this effect is greater in the context of vector feeding.
Aim 1: Define the mechanism by which IFN-λ restricts acute HSV-1 skin disease. 1A: define the IFN-λ
responsive leukocyte populations that limit skin lesion severity. 1B: define the pathogenic immune responses
suppressed by IFN-λ in the skin. 1C: investigate how IFN-λ signaling in keratinocytes limits HSV-1 skin disease.
Aim 2: Define the mechanism by which IFN-λ restricts recurrent HSV-1 skin disease. 2A: define the role
of IFN-λ specifically during HSV-1 recurrent disease. 2B: assess the kinetics of viral replication and skin lesion
formation using live animal luminescence imaging.
Aim 3: Define skin-specific effects of IFN-λ against mosquito-borne and tick-borne flaviviruses. 3A:
define the IFN-λ responsive cell types that restrict replication of mosquito-borne flaviviruses and tick-borne
flaviviruses in the skin. 3B: investigate the effect of vector saliva on IFN-λ mediated antiviral immunity in the skin."

 Antenatal care (ANC) and skilled births are mainstays of preventing maternal and perinatal morbidity
and mortality. Despite expanded availability of skilled birth attendants and referral health systems, Ugandan
women have low ANC use and skilled births, resulting in one of the highest maternal mortality ratios and
perinatal mortality rates in the world. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can support individuals to
internalize risks, need, and benefits of health services with high intervention delivery success. Provision of
multiple messaging approaches—such as scheduled SMS, telephone voice messages and social support
engagement—can empower individuals to seek and access care, and improve health outcomes. However,
despite successes in pilot studies, there is little data on effectiveness, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity
and incremental costs needed to adopt, or scale up such strategies in sub–Saharan Africa, where the public
health impact of such interventions is likely to be the greatest.
 As part of a K43 career development award (PI Atukunda), we used behavioral frameworks to develop
a user-centered mHealth-based, audio-SMS messaging application to support pregnant women to use
maternity care services in rural Uganda (Support-Moms app). The app shared health-related information
and engaged social support networks via scheduled SMS/audio reminders and upcoming ANC appointment
notifications. In a randomized 3-arm pilot study (n=120) comparing standard of care (SOC), scheduled
messaging (SM), and scheduled messaging plus social supporter engagement (SS), we observed high
intervention uptake, acceptability, and feasibility. All women whose social supporters were engaged on the
app attended ≥4 ANC visits, compared to 83% and 50% of women receiving only messages and SOC,
respectively. Nearly all women in the SS arm (98%) had a skilled delivery compared to 78% and 70% in SM
and SOC groups, respectively. We now propose a type 2 hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial to
evaluate and implement the Support-Moms intervention into routine care. We will test the effectiveness of
the intervention in a randomized controlled trial (N=824); our primary outcome will be the proportion of
healthcare provider-led skilled births (Aim 1). We will apply Proctor’s implementation outcomes framework
to evaluate acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and fidelity, and conduct in-depth interviews with
users and key stakeholders informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)
to refine implementation strategies for future scale-up (Aim 2). We will assess costs and cost-effectiveness
of implementing Support-Moms into routine care (Aim 3). We hypothesize that Support-Moms will be an
effective and cost-effective strategy to improve maternity service utilization. This proposal directly responds
to NIH and NICHD priorities described in PAR-22-105 and PAR-22-132 to reduce preventable causes of
maternal deaths and improve health for women during and after pregnancy."
10878904,"The long term goal of this project is to advance a CRISPR-based technology that genetically modifies human white adipocytes to a “brown-like”, thermogenic phenotype with greatly enhanced ability to promote metabolic health when implanted into obese, diabetic mice. Gene targeting is accomplished in this project without viral or expression vectors, but rather by delivering purified, endotoxin-free Cas9 protein and sgRNA complexes to adipocyte progenitors with nearly 100 percent efficiency. The central hypothesis we will test is that simultaneous CRISPR-based disruption of two distinct “browning suppression” pathways will synergize and convert abundant human white adipocytes to large numbers of rare, fully “brown- like”, therapeutic adipocytes. An attractive transcriptional suppressor target is NRIP1/RIP140, which when deleted by CRISPR in adipocytes causes 100-fold increases in expression of UCP1 and other “BAT” genes. We recently found Nrip1KO mouse or human adipocytes improve metabolic health when implanted in obese mice. An attractive suppressor target in a second thermogenic pathway (cAMP signaling) is the inhibitory RIIb subunit (gene Prkar2) of protein kinase A, which when deleted also upregulates UCP1. Remarkably, we found agonist stimulation of cAMP in Nrip1KO adipocytes upregulates UCP1 and beneficial factors in synergistic mode, approaching a full BAT phenotype. Specific Aim 1 will test the central hypothesis in vitro, leveraging lessons we learned during development of this CRISPR method under pilot Department of Defense funding. First, not all sgRNAs that cause indels in the target gene Nrip1 actually delete the protein. Thus, screening 10 to 20 Prkar2 sgRNAs will be performed in mouse and human adipocytes to define the most efficient at RIIb protein deletion and upregulation of UCP1, with least off-target effects. Second, conditions in which multiple sgRNAs function at near 100 percent efficiency will be used, allowing analysis of adipocytes with single Nrip1KO or Prkar2KO vs adipocytes with double Nrip1/prkar2KO. Efficacy of “brown-like” phenotype induction will be analyzed by cAMP determinations, Western blot and RT-PCR for thermogenic and beneficial secreted proteins, RNAseq signatures and glycolytic and oxygen consumption rates. We will thus determine whether deletion of RIIb plus NRIP1 proteins in mouse and human adipocytes is synergistic, converting white adipocytes to a near BAT phenotype. In Specific Aim 2, these CRISPR-engineered mouse and human adipocytes will be implanted in HFD fed wild type mice or HFD fed immune-compromised NSG mice, respectively. These studies will determine whether double Nrip1KO/Prkar2KO adipocytes are most effective in forming brown-like, implanted adipose depots, including extent of innervation and vascularization (light sheet microscopy). The implanted mice will be evaluated for glucose tolerance and energy expenditure (hyperinsulinemic clamp and metabolic cages). This project will thus define whether CRISPR-engineered mouse and human adipocytes doubly depleted of RIIb plus NRIP1 proteins have greater therapeutic potential than single KO or unmodified adipocytes."

Dominant mutations causing degeneration of spinal motor neurons are among the most common disabling
genetic diseases and have no effective treatment. Genome editing is rapidly moving toward clinical application,
yet many challenges remain to translate this potential into reality for dominant neurologic diseases. In particular,
therapeutic editing for dominant mutations requires exquisite precision to target only the mutant allele, which
often differs from the wild-type allele by only a single nucleotide. Furthermore, for many genes, a multitude of
dominant mutations can result in pathology. Designing and testing therapeutic reagents for every individual
mutation is daunting, but targeting common sites of heterozygous variation in cis with the disease mutation could
overcome this challenge and treat a large proportion of patients. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2E (CMT2E)
is a rare but illustrative example, as it causes severe debilitating disease and is known to be caused by >30
different mutations in the NEFL gene, with more reported yearly. The primary objective of this proposal is to
develop and validate a therapeutic gene editing platform for dominant motor neuron diseases, using CMT2E as
a test case. Rare, loss-of-function mutations in the NEFL gene are inherited in a recessive manner and
demonstrate that the heterozygous carriers are healthy, strong evidence that a single functional copy of the gene
is sufficient. This suggests that targeted inactivation of the disease allele would be an effective treatment
strategy. Indeed, our preliminary data shows that specifically targeting a severe CMT2E mutation is effective at
preventing pathology in vitro. We have developed a model of CMT2E based on human induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs), and observed severe phenotypes in motor neurons differentiated from mutant iPSCs. Our human
iPSC-based model of CMT2E provides an ideal platform to design therapeutic editing strategies. In the first aim,
we will carefully test mutation-specific editing for two different CMT2E mutations and develop rigorous phenotypic
assays for therapeutic effect in human iPSC-derived motor neurons. In the second aim, we will experimentally
identify the important non-coding regulatory sequences that control NEFL expression, where a large proportion
of common variants are found. In the third aim, we will systematically screen for the common heterozygous
variants that can be targeted by allele-specific editing to excise protein coding or critical regulatory regions and
inactivate the disease allele. Completion of these aims will build the foundation for pre-clinical development of
gene editing therapies for CMT2E. These studies will also provide proof-of-concept for a strategic approach that
can be generalized to other dominant neurogenerative diseases, such as the other forms of CMT2, and ALS."

Background: The prevailing model of epidermal differentiation is that transcription
factors recruit RNA Polymerase II to differentiation gene promoters only upon the
induction of differentiation. It is possible that mechanisms downstream of transcription
initiation such as transcriptional elongation can have major impacts on regulating
epidermal growth and differentiation. We have shown that specific elongation factors
such as ELL and ELL2 are necessary for epidermal growth while SPT6 is essential for
differentiation through the control of transcription elongation.
Objective/hypothesis: This proposal seeks to understand the regulation of epidermal
stem and progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation through transcription elongation.
We have found that up to 30% of induced epidermal differentiation genes contain
promoter proximal paused RNA polymerase II in stem and progenitor cells. Upon
differentiation, specific elongation factors such as SPT6 are necessary to promote the
transcriptional elongation of these paused differentiation genes. In stem and progenitor
cells there are also elongation factors that promote the transcription of growth and
proliferation genes to allow for epidermal renewal.
Specific Aims: (1) The role of transcription elongation factors on epidermal growth and
differentiation (2) Mechanisms on how elongation factors control epidermal growth and
differentiation.
Study Design: To study epidermal homeostasis in a more clinically relevant setting, we
generate 3-dimensionally intact human skin, containing human epidermal cells (that
have been permanently knocked down for transcription elongation factors) in the context
of human dermal stroma and basement membrane, regenerated on immune
compromised mice. By using this model, we can perform loss of function experiments on
the transcription elongation factors in regenerated human skin to characterize their role
in epidermal growth and differentiation. We will also use chromatin immunoprecipitations
followed by next generation sequencing to determine which genes the elongation factors
bind and regulate."

 The dorsal striatum (DS) is an important brain structure for normal sensorimotor control, including
decisions about how vigorously to move. As one example, loss of the dopamine input to DS is responsible for
bradykinesia in Parkinson's Disease. Yet how DS circuits processes information, and how this information
processing is modulated by dopamine, are not well understood.
 DS circuits include sparse populations of interneurons - most commonly expressing either parvalbumin
(PV+), somatostatin (SST+) or acetylcholine (ChAT+). Interneurons appear to coordinate the activity of striatal
spiny projection neurons (SPNs), and alterations in striatal interneurons are found in human Tourette
Syndrome and rodent models of dystonia. Studies in brain slices have found many ways in which striatal
interneurons can affect SPNs and each other, via direct connections and by modulation of dopamine release.
However it has been challenging to connect these various results together into a coherent vision of DS
microcircuit function. Progress has been hampered by the lack of critical data about the joint activity patterns of
DS interneurons, SPNs, and local dopamine fluctuations, at precise moments during well-controlled behavioral
tasks.
 To overcome this obstacle, this proposal uses an innovative, technically-advanced combination of
behavioral electrophysiology, optogenetics and optical dopamine sensors. We will perform real-time
measurements and manipulations of DS interneurons and dopamine, as freely-moving rats respond to cues.
The response times depend on rats' reward expectation for the selected action. Taking advantage of the
computational framework of reinforcement learning to derive trial-by-trial estimates of internal decision-
variables, we will test specific hypotheses about how the activity of distinct interneuron types is shaped by
recent choice and reward history.
 Aim 1 will characterize the activity of DS PV+, SST+ and ChAT+ interneurons as actions are initiated. In
both dorsolateral and dorsomedial striatum we will record bulk calcium signals from each subpopulation, or the
spiking of identified interneurons, simultaneously with dopamine signals. Aim 2 will examine how, and when,
transient suppression of interneurons affects movement initiation and the activity of nearby SPN ensembles.
Aim 3 will determine how loss of DS dopamine jointly affects interneuron activity and behavior.
 The long-term goals of this research program are to determine the fundamental operational principles
of striatal circuits. This knowledge would be of immense value in designing improved therapies for a wide
range of human neurological disorders."

 This R03 application is focused on creation of an innovative microneedle patch (MNP)
composed entirely of a polymerized 17β-estradiol (E2), the major female sex hormone. The
macromolecular pro-drug materials are cured thermosets in which every repeating unit in the
polyester chains contains an equivalent of E2. These crosslinked polyester resins undergo slow
hydrolytic degradation to release low doses of estrogen, locally at the site of implantation, for
exceptionally long time periods (up to many years). Transdermal microneedle patches offer
minimally invasive, painless administration of estrogen. These delivery methods enhance patient
compliance relative to repeated injections with hypodermic needles and they require lower doses
than oral administration due by avoiding first-pass hepatic clearance. Of all the many advanced
MNP technologies, there are still no examples of MNPs composed entirely of poly(pro-drug). Our
lab has developed a new class of polymerizable estrogen pro-drugs containing pendant alkene
groups. In this proposal, we will polymerize the pro-E2 monomers in a microneedle mold. A key
innovation is that we plan to tune the glass transition of the polymer network such that the needles
are hard and glassy at room temperature for skin penetration, but then they transition into a
soft/rubbery material upon equilibration to physiological temperature.
 This project is likely to make significant contributions by developing new poly(pro-drug)
based microneedle patches capable of releasing low doses of E2 transdermally for exceptionally
prolonged timescales. The chemistry and engineering approaches used here will be broadly
generalizable in two key ways: 1) our polymerization scheme is easily modified to accommodate
nearly any drug molecule with two or more reactive functional group handles, and 2) the MNP of
poly(pro-E2) can be applied to a broad range of clinical applications where prolonged low-dose
E2 is desired. Our goal for future work is to apply these E2-releasing MNPs in a preclinical rodent
model to first assess safety and skin irritation and later to explore the impact of the patch on
functional recovery from contusive spinal cord injury."

Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of inherited peripheral neuropathies with a cumulative
incidence of ~1:2500 people. There is no approved treatment for any of the 100 genetic subtypes of CMT,
presenting a large unmet clinical need. At least five forms of CMT are caused by dominant mutations in tRNA
synthetase genes, the housekeeping enzymes that charge amino acids onto their tRNAs for translation. We
recently proposed a mechanism for this disease wherein the mutant enzyme binds its tRNA, but does not release
it to the ribosome, effectively sequestering the substrate. This leads to ribosome stalling and activation of the
integrated stress response (ISR) through the sensor kinase GCN2. The activation of the ISR contributes to the
disease severity, and when ISR activation is blocked by genetically deleting or pharmacologically inhibiting
GCN2, the neuropathy is much milder in mouse models of CMT type 2D, caused by dominant mutations in Glycyl
tRNA synthetase (Gars1). The activation of the ISR has two primary effects: 1) eukaryotic initiation factor 2-
alpha (eIF2) is phosphorylated, suppressing cap-dependent translation, and 2) the transcription factor ATF4 is
selectively translated, promoting expression of cellular stress response genes. The goal of this project is to
determine which of these two outcomes of ISR activation are exacerbating the neuropathy in Gars1/CMT2D
mouse models. Towards this, we propose two aims. In Aim 1, we will examine the levels of translation in
Gars1/CMT2D mice with and without Gcn2 deletion. We have previously shown that motor neurons have
reduced translation in the Gars1 mutant mice, but whether translation remains low when the ISR is not activated,
or whether it recovers, paralleling the improvement in the neuropathy phenotype, is unknown. We will use
fluorescent non-canonical amino acid tagging to assay translation in motor neurons and other spinal cord cell
types in these mice. In Aim 2, we will address the possible role of ATF4. In one experiment, we will overexpress
a conditional ATF4 transgene in motor neurons in an otherwise wild-type background. Our preliminary data
suggest this recapitulates some phenotypes seen in Gars1 mutant mice, implicating ATF4 target gene
expression as a way in which ISR worsens the Gars1 phenotype. In the second experiment, we will use a
conditional knockout of Atf4 to delete the gene from motor neurons in a Gars1/CMT2D genetic background to
see if eliminating ATF4 target gene expression alleviates the neuropathy phenotype, as predicted by our ATF4
overexpression preliminary data. In Aim 2, the mice will be evaluated using behavioral, neurophysiological,
histopathological, and gene expression assays that we have established as clinically relevant and central to the
disease process in the Gars1 mice. Upon completion, these experiments will indicate whether it is decreased
translation or expression of ATF4 target genes (or a combination) that is contributing to the ISR-mediated
neuropathy in the CMT2D mice. These results may reveal novel, more focused points of therapeutic intervention
in this disease."
10843153,"Pain is a common and distressing symptom for cancer patients. There is strong evidence that behavioral pain
interventions – a non-pharmacological approach to pain management – are efficacious for decreasing pain. Yet,
these interventions are not currently widely available to cancer patients due to a number of system, provider,
and patient access barriers. Efficacious behavioral pain interventions that are technology-based (vs. face to face)
have the potential to decrease access barriers and dramatically improve reach. A standalone mobile app would
eliminate the need for a therapist, be available to the patient at all times, and be easily accessible on a personal
smartphone or tablet. Mobile apps also offer increased options for real-time personalization (e.g., messaging
based on daily pain assessment), which can increase engagement and improve overall outcomes. We have
developed a mobile application – PainPac – that has been used as an adjunct to in person and videoconferencing
interventions. We have not yet examined PainPac as a standalone intervention. PainPac is an innovative mobile
app program that provides patients with coping skills modules of efficacious cognitive-behavioral theory-based
pain management strategies. PainPac can be implemented through automated, electronic submission to patients
via text, email, and/or MyChart (patient facing medical record) based on a clinical pain report (> 4/10) at a clinical
oncology appointment. Our long-term goal is to use mobile app technologies to facilitate widespread
implementation of efficacious behavioral cancer pain interventions. The overall objective of this application,
which is the next step toward attainment of our long-term goal, is to demonstrate that a mobile app intervention,
compared to standard videoconferencing sessions, is feasible (primary aim) and a promising strategy to
decrease pain in patients with cancer. Our central hypothesis is our standalone mobile app behavioral cancer
pain intervention (PainPac) will demonstrate high feasibility, as well as low patient burden, high engagement,
and high acceptability that is at least comparable to a videoconferencing protocol (PCST-Video). We will use a
randomized controlled trial to test three aims. The first aim is to test whether PainPac is feasible (primary aim),
as well as low burden, engaging, and acceptable to cancer patients. The second aim is to examine the impact
of PainPac on pain severity and interference, pain disability, pain self-efficacy, and quality of life. The third aim
is to gather qualitative post-treatment data on cancer patients’ preferences, barriers, and facilitators regarding
PainPac to optimize PainPac for a future large randomized clinical effectiveness trial. This work has the potential
to create a paradigm shift for behavioral pain intervention practice. If PainPac is feasible and beneficial for helping
cancer patients learn to manage their pain, the mobile app is poised to be widely disseminated ultimately
decreasing pain and suffering for patients with cancer."
10805433,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations in the KRAS GTPase are some of the most frequent gain-of-function alterations in cancer. KRAS
mutations are found in 25% of patients with lung cancer and nearly half of these involve a G12C substitution.
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality and, considering that more than 250,000 people
are diagnosed each year with lung cancer in the US, developing therapeutic strategies that directly targeting
KRAS oncoprotein is of paramount importance. The discovery of inhibitors that selectively target KRAS G12C
has been one of the most exciting recent developments in precision oncology. We previously showed that the
inhibitors trap the oncoprotein in an inactive (GDP-bound) state by blocking its reactivation by nucleotide
exchange and that such inhibition requires the breakdown of GTP by mutant KRAS in cancer cells. Inactive
state selective KRAS G12C inhibitors (e.g., sotorasib and adagrasib) have a 37-43% objective response rate
(ORR) and a 6-8 month median progression free survival (PFS) in patients with lung cancer. Sotorasib was
approved by the food and drug administration (FDA) as a second line treatment in patients with KRAS G12C-
mutant lung cancer. Despite these early successes more work is needed if we are to dramatically affect the
survival of patients with KRAS mutant cancer. The current proposal seeks to identify factors responsible for
modulating drug adaptation and resistance in patients and to identify improved KRAS-directed therapeutic
approaches. The first part of the proposal builds on our preclinical work showing that isogenic lung cancer cells
bypass G12C inhibition in a non-uniform manner. Our preliminary data suggest this occurs because of the
conformation-specific nature of available G12Ci and the synthesis of new KRAS G12C in some drug-treated
cells. In Aim 1, we will determine the heterogeneity in response and adaptation to treatment with inhibitors
targeting either the active or the inactive conformation of mutant KRAS. The studies will be performed in
parallel in clinical specimens and in patient derived models to ensure robustness and reproducibility. Aim 2
builds on our recent effort to study acquired resistance in patients treated with sotorasib or adagrasib. Here we
will focus on alterations that cause resistance to emerging active state selective drugs, relying initially on
patient-derived models and then on clinical specimens, once these drugs enter clinical testing in late 2022. In
addition, prospective studies with barcoded populations will investigate the clonal interactions that guide the
selection of resistance-causing alterations. In Aim 3 we will study the mechanisms by which the alterations or
phenotypes identified in the preliminary data or in Aims 1 and 2 lead to resistance. The early success of KRAS
G12C inhibitors has inspired the development of additional KRAS inhibitors that are entering clinical trials and
promise to improve the survival and quality of life of patients with KRAS driven cancer. The proposed work will
be of vital importance in maximizing the therapeutic potential of these long-awaited therapies."

 Despite more than 5 million people living in the U.S. with the long-term effects of traumatic brain injury
(TBI), it remains unknown at what point the TBI functional recovery trajectory is fixed. Existing TBI prognostic
models are imperfect and static, relying on data from admission and the first 6 hours only. Current models
explain only one-third of the variability in outcomes. Despite the multiple CT and MRI scans obtained in TBI
clinical care, neuroimaging remains underutilized for TBI prognostics. Image-based biomarkers and radiomics
can extract predictive signals from neuroimaging already being obtained. Prognostication matters: better
prognostics translate to better patient-centered clinical decision making and better prognostic stratification for
clinical trials. Multiple TBI therapies have failed in clinical translation due to basic challenges in patient
selection and predicting TBI recovery. At many hospitals across the U.S., trauma surgeons are the primary
providers responsible for patients with hospitalized TBI. We can and should do better by developing a mature
quantitative approach to prognostication that incorporates time-varying clinical data, advanced statistical
modeling, TBI-specific biomarkers, and image-based biomarkers from clinical imaging already being obtained.
This career development plan (PI: Amelia W. Maiga, Trauma Surgeon) helps sustain a minimum of 75%
protected effort to hone her research expertise and eventual independence in advanced statistical modeling,
clinical trials, and neuroimaging analysis for TBI prognostication. The research specific aims are to: AIM 1)
build and validate a TBI prognostic model for 12-month functional outcomes with rich time-varying clinical data,
radiomics imaging analysis, and biomarkers using two NIH cohorts (R01GM120484 and U01NS086090); and AIM
2) conduct a trajectory analysis of long-term functional and neurocognitive outcomes after TBI.
 This career development plan for Dr. Maiga integrates a) advanced didactics in clinical trials and
neurocognitive follow-up in the critically injured, sophisticated statistical modeling, imaging analysis, and
scientific communication and leadership; b) participation in local, regional, and national conferences to
advance expertise in the above areas; c) a multidisciplinary mentored research experience; and d) an
outstanding environment to propel towards independence. Her mentorship team consists of Drs. Mayur B.
Patel (Primary Mentor, trauma, critical illness and TBI); Pratik P. Pandharipande (cognitive impairment);
Rameela Raman (prognostic modeling, trajectory analysis); James C. Jackson (long-term outcomes); and
Bennett A. Landman (neuroimaging, radiomics), supported by a Research Advisory Council of Drs. E. Wesley
Ely (Director of Critical Illness and Brain Dysfunction Center); Robert S. Dittus (Director of Vanderbilt’s Institute
of Medicine and Public Health); Geoff T. Manley (PI TRACK-TBI; Transforming Research and Clinical
Knowledge in TBI). This research award will position Dr. Maiga to become a leader in TBI prognostics."

Cleft lip is the 4th most common birth defect in the U.S. and is known to affect annually one in 800 babies worldwide.
The Kids First program aims to uncover the etiology of these diseases and foster data sharing within the
pediatric research community. Expert-Driven Small Projects to Strengthen Gabriella Miller Kids First Discovery
(RFA-RM-22-006) is intended to “engage experts in a variety of activities that will enhance the utility of
childhood cancer and/or structural birth defects genomic datasets generated by the Kids First program and/or
associated phenotypic datasets and resources”. In this proposal we specifically propose to analyze in-depth
the Kids First curated datasets assembled for the cohort Orofacial Cleft: African and Asian Ancestry (253
Families) currently available through the framework CAVATICA at the Kids First data portal.
 Currently single nucleotide variation (SNV) analysis in syndromic and non-syndromic OFC has found
functional impairments in genes such as IRF6, BMP4, MAPK3, etc. However, considering that Structural
Variations (SVs) account for more total base-pair variation in human genomes than SNVs, we argue that this
topic is an important and missing component of this Kids First project. Exploring the role of SVs in the
manifestation of the OFC phenotype will require a search beyond gene regions, since intergenic SVs can
cause impairment to normal enhancers and transcription factors. We will explore three main SV types:
deletion, duplication and inversions by looking for common and individual SV alleles that differ from the
parents. We will also look at the OFC associated genes along with the related transcription factors, paralogs
and associated intergenic regions to fully characterize potentially causative SVs. Using a set of preidentified
39 gene loci including IRF6, we will closely survey the 244 triads and use a healthy human cohort to filter the
results (1000 Genome Project Phase 3 study, 2504 samples). This analysis will complement the SNV analysis
for this data that has already been completed and will provide additional context for the total genomic
landscape. We will disseminate our work to the scientific community and compare our results with previous
copy number variation (CNV) literature and share the SV triad workflows we develop to enable a similar
analysis on other Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First) datasets."

Each day, there are an estimated 28 cervical cancer deaths in Nigeria, making cervical cancer the second
most common cancer among women in the entire country. Only a minority of women eligible for screening
(screen-eligible) in Nigeria (30-49 years old) regularly, have received HPV screening - an essential component
of comprehensive cervical cancer prevention programs recommended by the Nigerian Federal Ministry of
Health and the Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Nigeria (SOGON). Conventional screening that relies
on Pap smears and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) at centralized clinics, coupled with a lack of locally
relevant implementation strategies have stalled progress. Innovative strategies to decentralize screening and
increase women’s ownership in this process are urgently needed. In this proposal, we will adapt an existing
HPV assay that combines loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and fast one-pot lyophilization
protocol within a lateral flow assay (LFA) for the Nigerian context, and then use participatory strategies
(crowdsourcing open calls and learning communities) to finalize components of a single woman-centered HPV
self-test kit. Crowdsourcing open calls have a group of individuals (i.e., screen-eligible women) solve all or part
of a problem, then implement selected high-quality solutions. Learning communities help participants refine
and optimize solutions before evaluation or use among screen-eligible women in Nigeria. Our collaborative
research team has successfully used crowdsourcing open calls and learning communities to increase HIV self-
testing among Nigerian youth, providing a strong foundation for the proposed research study. Our preliminary
data demonstrate that our HPV self-test prototype can reliably detect HPV 16 and 18 genotypes that account
for 70% of all cervical cancer cases. Once the prototype meets stringent diagnostic and trial preparedness
metrics among Nigerian women, including detection of additional common HPV genotypes (31, 35, and 52),
the project will move from the initial engineering phase (Specific Aim 1) to the clinical phase (Specific Aims 2
and 3). Drawing on a design and participatory action research framework, we propose the following specific
aims: (1) to adapt an HPV self-test assay for point-of-care and simultaneous detection of HPV genotypes 16,
18, 31, 35, and 52 in Nigeria; (2) to use crowdsourcing open calls and participatory learning communities
among screen-eligible women to finalize a single HPV self-testing implementation strategy (3) Determine
whether a final revised HPV self-testing strategy increases HPV screening among 900 screen-eligible women
in 18 local government areas versus usual care using a stepped-wedge, pragmatic randomized control trial.
Our study will be among the first to examine how women themselves can be prime movers in optimizing,
implementing and evaluating HPV self-testing implementation strategy that incorporates their unique needs to
prevent cervical cancer. Our focus on open calls and tailoring HPV services for screen-eligible women
resonates with NCI, NIH, and US government strategic priorities."
10815861,"Project Summary
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and the fastest growing
malignancy in the United States. The use of radioembolization or external beam radiation are frequently used
for HCC treatment. However, both these techniques demonstrate a treatment response of only 25-89%
depending on the evaluation criteria used and progression free survival of roughly 13 months. Consequently,
additional strategies for HCC radiosensitization are greatly needed. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a well-
established technique for HCC imaging and employs ultrasound-sensitive microbubbles to better visualize tumor
vascularity. Ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction (UTMD) and nanobubble destruction has been shown
to sensitize tumors to radiotherapy by inducing vascular endothelial cell apoptosis and increasing ceramide
production. Our group has demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of using UTMD for
sensitizing HCC to radiotherapy in animal models and, more recently, in a randomized clinical trial. However, we
believe the magnitude of these bioeffects is limited by the size of UCAs (1-8 µm in diameter), which restricts their
extravasation into the tumor tissue and limits the shear forces generated during cavitation. One attractive
alternative to UCAs is acoustic droplets, which are composed of liquid perfluorocarbons encapsulated above
their boiling point. The smaller size of these agents (< 200 nm) and stability relative to nanobubbles permits
greater penetration into the tumor interstitium compared to ultrasound-sensitive bubbles. Acoustic droplets can
be locally vaporized and destroyed using diagnostic ultrasound equipment, thereby generating larger local forces
on the surrounding tissue than can be achieved with UTMD. Consequently, this proposal will investigate the use
of acoustic droplets to improve HCC radiosensitivity relative to UCA. Two specific droplet formulations will be
used, prioritizing either efficient clinical translation or droplet stability in vivo. In aim 1 we will characterize acoustic
droplets made via condensation of a commercially approved UCA and by benchtop fabrication of phospholipid-
coated perfluorobutane droplets, and evaluate their ability to initiate ceramide production, cellular apoptosis, and
radiosensitivity relative to micro- and nanobubbles following ultrasound-triggering in vitro. Aim 2 will evaluate the
ability of the two acoustic droplet formulations to generate ceramide production and vascular disruption relative
to micro- and nanobubbles in a subcutaneous syngeneic model of HCC as well as explore the effects on tumor
immune response. Finally, aim 3 will assess the potential improvement of the two acoustic droplet formulations
relative to ultrasound-sensitive gas bubbles to act as a radiosensitizer in an orthotopic model of human HCC. At
the conclusion of this work, we will have evaluated the mechanisms and potential therapeutic advantages of
using acoustic droplet vaporization for HCC radiosensitization. These approaches are clinically translatable and
may ultimately improve HCC patient survival by improving radiotherapy response."
10814391,"ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to define the molecular mechanisms of an error-prone, stress-induced
Okazaki fragment maturation (OFM) pathway by which cancer cells counteract replication stress and survive.
Replication stress is a hallmark of cancer cells and has been considered the Achilles' heel for cancer treatment
such as radio- and chemotherapy. Under elevated temperature stress, yeast cells mutant for flap endonuclease 1
(FEN1 in humans or RAD27 in yeast) activate DNA damage response pathways to block cell proliferation and
induce cell senescence and death; however, a subpopulation of cells can overcome these barriers and escape
otherwise lethal conditions. Genome-wide mutations and rearrangements have been suggested as a major
molecular mechanism that drives this evolution. However, how such spontaneous mutations are acquired in cells
under replication stress is a long-standing question. Recently, we identified an error-prone, 3' flap OFM pathway
that is activated in response to stress to support cell survival and fuel cellular evolution; its induction leads to
genome-wide mutagenesis and suppression of restrictive growth temperature-induced lethality, a process
mimicking that of cancer cells acquiring drug resistance. This led us to a model in which OFM can go in two
ways, which may dictate the fate of cells, including human cancer cells: a 5' flap-based, error-free process or an
alternative 3' flap-based, stress-induced, and error-prone process. However, key components that drive such
flap dynamics remain undefined. The objectives of the proposed project are to define the key enzymes that
catalyze 3' flap formation and cleavage in mammalian cells and to provide proof of concept that suppressing
alternative 3' flap OFM can prevent drug resistance in human cancer cells. Further preliminary data gathered to
support this grant application show that 3' flap OFM is conserved in both yeast and human cells. We observed
that anti-cancer EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors activated the ATM/CHK2 DNA damage checkpoints in human
lung cancer cells. Using yeast genetic screening, we identified Pif1 (PIF1 in humans) and Sgs1 (BLM and WRN
in humans) as helicases for 5' to 3' flap transformation and Rad1 (XPF in humans) and Mus81 (MUS81 in
humans) as 3' nucleases for 3' flap cleavage, in addition to the 3' nuclease activity of Pol . Therefore, our central
hypothesis is that unprocessed 5' flaps in mammalian cells activate ATM/ATR and CHK1/2 signaling to recruit
and stimulate PIF1, BLM, and WRN and/or other helicases for transforming 5' flaps into 3' flaps for nucleolytic
degradation by 3' nucleases including Pol , XPF, and/or MUS81, and that blocking the 3' flap OFM pathway
will suppress DNA mutations and thus prevent drug resistance. To test this, we will: i) determine the roles of
helicases PIF1, BLM, and WRN in 3' flap formation and induction of alternative OFM; ii) define the functional
distribution of 3' nucleases Pol , XPF, and MUS81 in processing 3' flaps with or without secondary structures
during 3' flap OFM; and iii) define the extent to which stress-activated ATM/CHK2 signaling induces 3' flap OFM
and mutations to support cancer cell survival and promote drug resistance."
10914642,"Background: As part of comprehensive suicide prevention, VA integrated mental and physical health services
to better detect and treat depression. Primary care nurses conduct screening annually. Clinicians, including
Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) specialists, follow up as-needed for treatment. Depression
detection and management processes are complex, involve multilevel stakeholders, and subject to significant
disruption from COVID-19 and from resulting expansion of telehealth aiming to preserve care access. Fewer
VA visits during the pandemic may signify lowered depression care quality and worsened patient outcomes.
Significance: Depression affects 1 in 5 Veterans and is a leading cause of suicidality and disability. It
contributes substantially to the current pandemic-related mental health crisis. Depression symptoms, including
suicidal thoughts/behaviors, and related functional impairment have increased since COVID onset. Partnering
with Primary Care, Mental Health, and Connected Care leaders, we propose to study pandemic-related service
disruptions for depression, which may help to mitigate acute care use and mortality in the Veteran population.
We apply established depression quality indicators from our prior research to a broad national scale at a critical
time. We will also obtain feedback to improve current hybrid (virtual/in-person) care models from VA providers
and Veterans who screened positive, including those who were not detected to have depression.
Specific Aims: To improve virtual and in-person services for the VA primary care population during recovery,
this proposal will examine how the pandemic disrupted depression care delivery mechanisms, including
expanded telehealth, and patient outcomes. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To examine engagement in guideline-
concordant care for depression (virtual or in-person) following screening, before and during the pandemic; 2)
To compare psychiatric emergency/hospital visits and mortality from suicide between Veterans who screened
positive and were detected versus not detected to have depression by clinicians; 3) To understand VA patients’
and providers’ current perspectives on addressing new depressive episodes using virtual and in-person
modalities during the pandemic and eventual recovery.
Methodology: Given hypothesized care disruption (lowered care quality) during COVID-19, Aim 1 proposes to
extend our preliminary VISN methods nationally to assess the VA population’s trajectory from a new positive
depression (and suicide-risk) screen to appropriate treatment (i.e., medication, therapy) in FY19-22/23. We will
also examine the changing mix of virtual and in-person depression care delivered. Aim 2 will use interrupted
time series analyses to explore the extent to which acute care use may be mitigated by clinician detection of
depression nationally. We will also compare mortality rates between patients detected and not detected to
have depression. Sub-analyses will reveal where (e.g., clinics with low PC-MHI access) and for whom (e.g.,
minorities) detection does not systematically occur, and downstream negative sequelae, to guide future
intervention. Finally, Aim 3 will interview (1) 40 Veterans who were detected and not detected to have
depression per Aims 1 & 2 about care-seeking behavior change, digital divide, etc. and (2) 40 VA primary care
and PC-MHI providers about staffing shortage, telehealth adoption, etc. across three VAs (GLA, Syracuse, and
Durham). In addition to contextualizing disrupted care findings, qualitative data will help isolate best practices
on patient-to-provider and provider-to-provider (e.g., handoffs) interactions in hybrid depression care models.
Next Steps/Implementation: The COVID-19 pandemic provides the VA with an opportunity to improve upon a
system-wide proactive response to depression and suicide, one that is conceptualized to care for the entire
Veteran population. This proposed research will provide the basis for testable hypotheses (e.g., acceptable
virtual depression treatments in primary care), and clinical recommendations (e.g., satisfactory virtual provider-
to-provider handoffs for new patient referrals), to improve virtual and in-person VA depression services."
10842302,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal aims to determine how cell growth triggers cell division, which is a fundamental question in cell
and developmental biology. Its understanding will also greatly impact our knowledge of cancer, where this
process is misregulated. It has long been known that cell growth triggers human cell division at the G1/S
transition before DNA is replicated. But, although many key regulatory proteins linking cell growth to cell division
are known, the molecular mechanisms mammalian cells use to control their size have remained poorly
understood and have been based solely on the study of cells growing in culture. My laboratory recently made a
breakthrough advance in understanding how growth triggers division. Contrary to expectations that growth would
increase Cyclin D-Cdk4,6 activity, we found instead that cell growth dilutes the cell cycle inhibitor Rb to trigger
division in cultured cells. Our discovery of the Rb dilution mechanism in cell culture raises three key questions
which are the focus of this grant: 1. What is the molecular mechanism regulating Rb’s concentration dynamics
that control cell size? 2. What is the function of Rb-based cell size control? 3. Do Rb dilution or other cell size
control mechanisms link cell growth to cell division in vivo. We have begun to address the first question and our
preliminary data indicate that the mechanism regulating the size-dependence of Rb concentration is translational.
To further determine how this molecular mechanism works we will take an approach using reporters to identify
the DNA-sequence element responsible and then the corresponding proteins regulating its function. To address
the second question, we will take a mass spectrometry-based approach to measure how protein concentrations
change with cell size across the proteome. Preliminary data indicate that proteins associated with senescence
phenotypes increase in concentration in large cells. This suggests that cell size may be causal for senescence
and cell size control functions to avoid this deleterious outcome. To address the final question to definitively test
the Rb dilution and alternative models, we will perform a series of in vivo experiments. This is important because
recent studies in cell culture have reported conflicting results about how animal cells control their size. To
determine how animal cell growth triggers cell division in vivo, we propose to examine the mouse epidermis
because it has a large population of proliferating stem cells whose division dynamics can be assayed using live-
cell imaging. We will measure changes in keratinocyte cell size in a series of mouse lines in which the Rb family
of genes has been conditionally deleted or over-expressed in the mouse epidermis. This will test our central
hypothesis that Rb1 is crucial for cell size control in vivo. We will also use mouse genetics to test the alternative
hypothesis that the p38 stress activated protein kinase controls cell size. Taken together, successful completion
of these aims will have a big impact on understanding how cell growth triggers cell division. This is important
because it allows cells to control their size, which is fundamental to cell physiology."
10879037,"The goal of this study is to characterize intersectional stigma related to gender identity, sexual behaviors,
sexual orientation, race, and poverty, as a social determinant of HIV-related health among sexual and gender
minorities (SGM) in the US. This proposal was developed in response to NIH’s Notice of Special Interest
(NOSI) to focus on understanding the role of intersectional stigmas and how they harm health.
A high prevalence of mental, physical, and sexual health problems has consistently been documented among
SGM, including sexually transmitted infections (STIs), depression, and substance use. While stigma is
understood to affect these outcomes, there is limited consensus on optimal intersectional stigma measurement
strategies for both transgender women (TW) and cisgender men who have sex with men (cis-MSM) or on the
mechanisms by which intersecting stigmas drive health disparities, including those modifiable through health
and behavioral interventions. Our investigative team has an active NIMH-funded R01(R01MH110358) focused
on measuring stigma related to sexual behavior and examining how this stigma drives disparities in HIV
outcomes for cis-MSM using data from around the world, including from the American Men’s Internet Survey
(AMIS) in the US. In addition, we developed and piloted the Transgender Women’s Internet Survey and
Testing (TWIST) platform, demonstrating high burdens of anticipated, perceived, and enacted stigmas related
to gender identity and their association with decreased use of HIV prevention services, greater psychological
stress, and suicidal ideation among TW in the US. Here, we propose to collect data on trends in stigma and
health in two cross-sectional online surveys of sexually active TW (n=3,000 in Years 2,4) and three of cis-MSM
(n=10,000 in Years 1,3,5) accompanied by testing of self-collected biospecimens from 500 TWIST participants
and 500 AMIS participants per survey (n=2,500 total). Consistent with NIH’s NOT-MH-20-020, we will build
upon our prior foundational work to better assess intersectional stigma and its HIV and other health impacts for
TW and cis-MSM in the US using a mixed-methods, transformative study designed to meet the following aims.
Aim 1: Optimize metrics of intersectional stigma experienced by diverse transgender women and cisgender
men who have sex with men sampled online in the US.
Aim 2: Qualitatively explore perspectives of transgender women and cisgender-men who have sex with men
(MSM) of how intersecting stigmas shape engagement in HIV prevention and treatment services.
Aim 3a: Characterize cross-sectional relationships between intersectional stigmas and engagement in HIV
prevention/treatment and gender affirmative care among national samples of TW and cis-MSM in the US.
Aim 3b. Determine demographic, geographic, and temporal heterogeneities in the burden of intersectional
stigmas and associations with sexual health, mental health and resilience, and engagement in HIV prevention
and treatment in follow-up cross-sectional nationwide surveys of TW and cis-MSM."
10854931,"SUMMARY
Changes in reproductive hormones across the menstrual cycle may be a key biological source of symptom
variability in psychopathology. Strong individual differences in neural sensitivity to normal hormone changes
can result lability of a wide range of emotional, interpersonal, and behavioral symptoms; however, the
biobehavioral mechanisms underlying these effects are not yet well understood. Borderline personality disorder
(BPD) is a severe and costly psychiatric condition comprising labile symptoms across many domains of
functioning. Our pilot data suggest three distinct biologically based mechanisms may produce cycle-based
symptom exacerbation, contributing to symptom lability: 1) reactive and interpersonal symptoms due to
irritability from changes in progesterone (P4) levels, 2) depressive symptoms due to impaired cognitive
functioning and increased rumination during estrogen (E2) withdrawal, and 3) risk-taking symptoms due
increased reward responsiveness during E2 peaks (ovulation). The objectives of this research are to test a
model of three RDoC-consistent biologically-based mechanisms underlying how the menstrual cycle
exacerbates psychopathology. A sample of 170 women ages 18 to 45 with ≥3 BPD symptoms will be recruited
from specialized clinical services and social media. Participants will be comprehensively assessed for BPD and
exclusion criteria (e.g., use of hormone-based medication or hormonal conditions). Participants will complete
well-established assessment measures of BPD and other psychopathological symptoms and diagnoses during
a baseline laboratory visit within the within the first few days of the start of their menstrual cycle. Then, they will
provide complete questionnaires about BPD symptoms and proposed mechanisms every evening for two
complete cycles. During one cycle, they will complete tasks targeted to key cycle phases, based on menses
onset and ovulation test results, and daily urine samples for hormone assay each morning. Specific Aims.
Aim 1 is to evaluate whether shifts in hormones across cycle predict within-person changes in symptoms
consistent with proposed triadic hormone sensitivity theory, with rising levels of P4 predicting increases in
rejection sensitivity, interpersonal conflict, and impulsive reactivity to stress, decreasing levels of E2 predicting
increases in depression, hopelessness, and suicidal ideation, and peaks in E2 (ovulation) predicting increases
in proactive aggression and substance misuse. Aim 2 is to evaluate whether proposed psychological
mechanisms mediation associations between hormonal changes and symptom effects, with increased
irritability expected to mediate P4 effects, decreased cognitive functioning expected to mediate E2 withdrawal
effects, especially for individuals with greater rumination-proneness, and increased reward responsiveness
expected to mediate ovulatory effects. An exploratory Aim 3 will examine the extent to which presence of these
three forms of hormone sensitivity are associated. Findings will inform development of individualized,
transdiagnostic interventions to mitigate the impact of cycle-based symptom exacerbation."

This is a competitive renewal of the NCI T32 Cancer Prevention and Control and Cancer Health Equity (CPC-
CE) Training Program at the Massey Cancer Center (MCC) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The
training program has been active for three 5-year cycles – first as an R25 and, in 2018, successfully transitioned
to a T32. The present training application has a renewed focus on cancer health equity and reducing cancer
disparities to meet the needs of MCC's catchment area and align with MCC's center-wide theme. MCC's
catchment area is diverse and includes “hot spots” of elevated cancer risk in rural and minority communities,
with several counties having elevated age-adjusted cancer rates. This unique catchment area serves as a
backdrop for research and training being conducted within rural and urban communities and among a diverse
residential population. As the longest-standing NCI-funded T32 training program at MCC, the CPC-CHE program
is highly valued by the institution and supported in matching funds by VCU, MCC and the School of Medicine.
The program brings together 25 primary and 6 secondary mentors from 12 departments across three
schools/colleges. During the current funding period, 33% of the trainees were from racial/ethnic groups
underrepresented in biomedical and behavioral science and 90% were female. One-hundred percent of the
predoctoral trainees secured postdoctoral training positions and four out of five postdoctoral trainees who have
completed the program are in academic/research faculty positions and the other is working in a non-profit
research-related career. The proposed T32 has four objectives: 1) offer an integrated training program with a
broad range of research opportunities in cancer prevention and control and/or cancer health equity, including an
option to complete a concentrated Master of Science or public health degree; 2) provide structured didactic
training in cutting-edge research methods to support career advancements in cancer prevention and control and
cancer health equity science; 3) cultivate a collaborative community that will form the foundation for effective
professional development and career readiness; and 4) provide training to emerging scholars from diverse socio-
economic and racial/ethnic backgrounds through intensive mentoring. The program requests support for two
predoctoral and five postdoctoral trainee slots. The selection of seven scholars will allow for an approximate 4:1
mentor/trainee ratio."
10833063,"Project Summary
Almost all living cells use specific non-enzymatic carbohydrate binding proteins (e.g. lectins) to recognize
carbohydrate ligands for cellular trafficking, signaling and defense. The systematic study of lectins and their
carbohydrate ligands has improved our understanding of human health and the high specificity of lectins for
certain cellular interactions has made them a valuable resource for therapeutic discovery. In previous research,
my laboratory suggested that human commensal microbiota utilize lectins (e.g. human-microbial-lectins) to
regulate a complex network of host-microbe interactions beyond those mediated by simple pattern recognition
receptors and conserved microbial metabolites. Furthermore, our characterization of a highly prevalent human-
microbial-lectin Cbeg5 suggests this specific lectin may regulate fundamental human myeloid cell interactions
integral to normal microbiome homeostasis. As such, the central hypothesis of this proposal is that the study
of Cbeg5 and other human-microbial-lectins will elucidate microbiome functions relevant to human health and
which can be developed therapeutically. We will advance this hypothesis through three aims to define (1) how
Cbeg5 regulates distinct myeloid cell populations, (2) the potential to develop Cbeg5 as a therapeutic for
inflammatory bowel disease, and (3) to explore the larger network of microbiome interactions regulated by
human-microbial lectins."

Antibody-secreting plasma cells play critical roles in health and disease, yet little is known
about the biochemical mechanisms controlling antibody synthesis and secretion or how
these pathways intersect with pathways controlling cell survival. Furthermore, due to the
high metabolic demands inherent to robust antibody secretion and the tendency for many
plasma cells to persist for decades, pathways restraining apoptosis in plasma cells are
likely to be integrated in unique ways. This project centers on the hypothesis that long-
lived plasma cells in bone marrow obtain requisite signals to maintain antibody secretion
and avoid cell death by sensing extracellular ATP with a purinergic receptor known as
P2rX4. We further hypothesize that eATP is produced locally in the bone marrow for
plasma cells by osteoblastic cells via the gap junction protein known as Panx3. Thus,
consistent with our preliminary data, inhibition of P2rX4 or Panx3 function is predicted to
cause the depletion of long-lived plasma cells and reduce serum antibody titers including
for disease-associated antibodies. To test our hypothesis, we will: 1) Define cell intrinsic
P2rX4-regulated outcomes for newborn and long-lived plasma cells, and 2) Define cell
extrinsic sources and outcomes for eATP/Panx3 regulation of long-lived plasma cells.
These studies will provide unique and needed insights into the specialized survival
mechanisms employed by long-lived plasma cells. This work supports our long-term
objective of developing strategies to effectively and specifically disable or deplete
problematic plasma cells."
11093599,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Copper is an essential co-factor for enzymes across the animal kingdom yet even modest intracellular
concentrations can be toxic, resulting in cell death. The toxicity of copper prompted the development of copper
ionophores such as elesclomol as potential cancer therapeutics. However, lack of clarity regarding their
mechanism of action has prevented their clinical development despite a favorable tolerability profile in clinical
trials. We have recently described that copper ionophores promote a surprising new form of regulated cell death,
distinct from other known and well annotated cell death pathways (such as apoptosis, ferroptosis and
necroptosis). This new form of regulated cell death is copper dependent (hence termed “cuproptosis”) and is
regulated by mitochondrial FDX1 and cellular protein lipoylation, a conserved lysine post-translational
modification regulating only 4 key mitochondrial enzymes. Despite this essential role in enabling cuproptosis,
little is known about the natural function of FDX1 in the cell, and the regulation and manifestation of protein
lipoylation in different cancer types. Establishing a coherent mechanism explaining FDX1 and protein lipoylation
regulation of copper ionophore induced cell death is crucial for any future attempts to repurpose these molecules
as cancer therapeutics. As such, we will combine multidisciplinary approaches that include genomic and
proteomic perturbation strategies with metabolite profiling and multiplexed imaging in cell culture and distinct
mouse tumor models to determine the natural function of the key regulators of cuproptosis (FDX1 and protein
lipoylation) in cancer cell growth and tumor formation, enabling a mechanistic understanding of how they regulate
cuproptosis. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will focus on elucidating the natural function of the key regulator of
cuproptosis, FDX1, in cells. We will take a focused approach to determine if it regulates Fe-S cluster biosynthesis
or protein lipoylation, we will use proteomic approaches to characterize its protein-protein interactions, and we
will perform deep mutational scanning to map the structure-function interactions of FDX1. In Aim 2, we will
specifically focus on the unique regulatory role of lipoylated DLAT in promoting cuproptosis. We will use different
image-based approaches to define the biophysical properties of lip-DLAT aggregates and their protein
composition identifying links to multiple other cellular features. In Aim 3 we will first explore the levels of protein
lipoylation across hundreds of cancer cell lines and establish the cell state associated with high lipoylation cancer
cells. Then, we will determine the manifestation and dependency on FDX1 and protein lipoylation in both classic
xenograft tumor models and in models of metastatic tumors growing in different organs. Lastly, we will use these
in vivo models to establish the efficacy and on-target engagement of copper ionophores in cancer cell models
that are predicted to be highly sensitive to these compounds. Together, this proposal will advance our
understanding of the role of FDX1 and protein lipoylation in cancer and how these key regulators promote
cuproptosis in cells and tumors."
10804646,"ABSTRACT:
One-in-four adults hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) experiences a major adverse
cardiac event (MACE). Individuals who experience MACE are 4-5 times more likely to die than those with
pneumonia alone. Hospitalization for CAP is also tied to greater risk of MACE and cardiovascular-associated
death in convalescence for at least 5 years. Thus, pneumonia damages the heart and this is linked to
MACE and cardiovascular-associated death during and after hospitalization. Streptococcus pneumoniae
(Spn), a Gram-positive bacterium, is the leading cause of CAP and invasive disease. During invasive
pneumococcal disease (IPD), Spn in the bloodstream gains access to the myocardium, where they replicate,
kill cardiomyocytes, and impair function. Notably, and in surviving animals that had been treated with
antimicrobials, cardiac damage caused by Spn results in tissue remodeling that has long-term negative effects
on heart function. Thus, pneumococci in the heart are direct effectors of cardiac damage and this helps
to explain CAP-associated MACE.
 Our laboratory has been studying the molecular basis of cardiomyocyte damage by Spn for close to a
decade. One key discovery we have made is that Spn that invade the heart are taken up by cardiomyocytes
via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, when pneumococci persist within these cells, their replication and
production of pneumolysin and hydrogen peroxide results in the death of the cardiomyocyte. Accordingly, we
have chosen to explore the importance of LC3-associated phagocytosis, a form of autophagy, on
cardiomyocyte self-defense. Our preliminary results support the hypotheses that: 1) autophagy protects the
heart during IPD; 2) autophagy contributes to the eradication of intracellular bacteria in the heart; 3)
cardiomyocyte autophagy sustains cardiac function post-infection. Testing of these hypotheses via
completion of the aims below will advance our understanding of the host-pathogen interactions that take place
in the heart during IPD with the potential to influence future intervention strategies. We will:
AIM 1: Determine the role of autophagy in protecting cardiomyocyte function and survivability
following Spn uptake. This will be done in vitro using autophagy-deficient (ATG7 null) adult mouse
cardiomyocytes and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes growing in a novel cardiac
tissue chip infected with Spn.
AIM 2: Determine the impact of autophagy on cardiac remodeling. This will be done in vivo using
cardiomyocyte-specific ATG7 null mice infected with Spn. Cardiac function will be evaluated using
echocardiography so that the extent of post-infection cardiac remodeling can be correlated to aberrant
function."
10816562,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm
infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal
permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky
gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory
test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify newborns susceptible to develop
NEC. We postulate that a mucosal immune phenotype detectable in fecal extracts, is reflective of the intestinal
microenvironment and postnatal barrier maturation and can distinguish infants at high risk for developing NEC.
The goal of this study is to investigate the diagnostic value of fecal immune biomarkers to identify “at-risk”
neonates with leaky gut prior to NEC onset. When used alone or in combination with other IP-associated neonatal
factors (i.e., postmenstrual age, feeding, microbiota), the immune phenotype can provide the basis of a non-
invasive, stool-based method to detect neonatal leaky gut. To achieve this goal, we will leverage existing stool
samples collected from a cohort of 205 preterms (<33 weeks gestation), from whom both gut microbiome (16S
rRNA gene sequencing and metagenome) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose)
are known. Two aims are proposed: 1) to conduct an in-depth characterization of cytokines and chemokines in
fecal extracts of preterm infants during the first 7-10 days of life, and to determine the diagnostic value of fecal
immune biomarkers in identification of aberrantly elevated IP as a major risk factor for NEC; 2) to define
longitudinal changes of fecal immune biomarkers associated with improved or persistently elevated IP. At the
completion of this study, we will have identified a discriminatory mucosal immune phenotype representing a
novel, non-invasive stool-based diagnostic/screening tool to identify preterm newborn “at risk” for developing
NEC. This study will also provide new insights into the interplay between host immunity and gut microbiota
dysbiosis that contributes to heightened barrier injury in early life. These results will facilitate clinical studies to
evaluate rationally designed interventions for early NEC prevention and to promote healthy intestinal barrier
functions and newborn health."
10832102,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
 Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with tragic consequences for individuals and their families.
Despite the increased access to mental health services and use of psychiatric treatments, suicide rates have
remained unchanged over the last century. Worse, from 1999 to 2019 suicide rates increased 33% in the U.S.
Rapid, safe and effective antisuicidal therapies are critically needed.
 Our group has characterized a circuit biomarker that may predict and explain the antisuicidal effects of
ECT. Before ECT, excessively anticorrelated functional connectivity (FC) between the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) and the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) predicts greater post-ECT antisuicidal response (predictor
biomarker), and greater reduction of ACC-IPL anticorrelated FC during ECT is associated with greater
antisucidal efficacy (response biomarker or treatment target). This finding led us to hypothesize a novel
biomarker-informed treatment strategy aiming to engage this treatment target: TMS over the right IPL could be
used to focally reduce ACC-IPL anticorrelated FC and hence reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB).
 Recent innovations in TMS have established that intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation (iTBS), an efficient
TMS protocol that lasts less than 3 minutes, is as effective an antidepressant when applied over the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as the traditional 38 minutes 10Hz TMS protocol: DLPFC iTBS was
cleared by the FDA in 2018. Given the brevity of iTBS, accelerated protocols (aiTBS) have been established to
deliver the equivalent number of pulses of an FDA-cleared 6-week course of iTBS in a single day, and to
repeat this for 5 consecutive days. When applied to the DLPFC, aiTBS seems safe and rapidly effective for
depression. Our preliminary evidence shows that individualized MRI-guided aiTBS over the right IPL of suicidal
patients is feasible, safe, leads to rapid reduction of STB and reduces ACC-IPL anticorrelation as predicted.
 The current proposal aims to develop rapid antisuicidal therapies for patients in their most vulnerable
periods: during hospitalization and post-discharge. The R61 phase will randomize patients in a depressive
episode with moderate to severe STB to receive 1 day (10 sessions) of active or sham aiTBS to the right IPL.
We will measure changes in FC, clinical reduction of STB and safety/tolerability. If we meet our a priori go
criteria, the following R33 phase will randomize patients hospitalized in a psychiatric unit with acute STB to
receive a full course of 5 days (50 sessions) of aiTBS, and we will measure FC, reduction of STB acutely and
during 1 month post-discharge and safety/tolerability of this intensive protocol. If successful, this project will
contribute to the development of highly individualized and biomarker-informed rapid treatments for suicidal
patients using noninvasive device neuromodulation, and establish the biological and clinical evidence for a
future large multicenter confirmatory trial to address one of the most critical problems in Psychiatry."
10807028,"Cardiovascular diseases such as vascular calcification are a leading cause of death in patients with chronic
kidney disease (CKD). However, there is no effective therapy for vascular calcification available.
Phosphotoxicity and lipototoxicity are the major causes of CKD-dependent vascular calcification. Our long-term
goal is to identify new pharmacological strategies for the prevention of vascular calcification. Our previous
studies have demonstrated that stearic acid (C18:0), one of the major saturated fatty acids (SFAs), is a critical
metabolite that contributes to CKD-dependent vascular calcification. Mechanistically, CKD-mediated
hyperphosphatemia (high inorganic phosphate) induces the significant repression of VSMC stearoyl-CoA
desaturase (SCD), which is a major enzyme that controls levels of C18:0 by converting it to oleic acid (C18:1n-
9). Accumulation of C18:0 by SCD strongly induces severe lipotoxicity in VSMCs, resulting in vascular
calcification. In addition, our group has found that the pro-calcific effect of C18:0 is mediated by two major
metabolites of C18:0 generated via the enzyme reaction with glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-4 (GPAT4):
1) 1,2-di-stearoyl-phosphatidic acid (18:0/18:0-PA), which induces vascular calcification through the activation
of the PERK-eIF2-ATF4 axis of the ER stress pathway and 2) 1-stearoyl-lysophoshatdic acid (18:0-LPA)
which strongly inhibits autophagic flux through the formation of abnormal MAM-associated omegasomes,
which are a platform for autophagosome formation. C18:0 induces vascular calcification through the activation
of the ER stress response and the inhibition of autophagy. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the
upstream event in which CKD-mediated hyperphosphatemia transcriptionally represses VSMC SCD has not
been studied. We believe that the identification of the mechanism has therapeutic potentials. To find clues of
the mechanism, we recently screened a library of chemicals that modulate epigenetics and gene transcription.
Based on the epigenetic and transcriptional chemical library screening, we identified two transcriptional
repressor candidates that contribute to phosphate-mediated SCD repression and vascular calcification. We
therefore propose two specific aims to elucidate the upstream event in the regulation of lipotoxicity-induced
vascular calcification. Aim 1 will examine whether the transcriptional repressor modulation complex affects
lipotoxicity and vascular calcification by altering SCD expression in cultured cells. Aim 2 will examine whether
modulation of transcriptional repressors affects phosphotoxicity, lipotoxicity and vascular calcification in vivo.
Completion of this project will provide a novel therapeutic target for CKD-mediated vascular calcification."
10928721,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this proposal is to improve treatment outcomes for post 9/11 veterans with alcohol use
disorder (AUD) and insomnia who are not currently accessing care through the Veterans Affairs Healthcare
System (VA) or other settings. Many post-9/11 veterans struggle with AUD and this can be especially
pronounced with the co-occurrence of insomnia. With upwards of 50% of veterans who have behavioral health
needs not seeking treatment, it is imperative to utilize advances in technology to develop and test interventions
that can reach non-treatment seeking veterans and target both symptoms of insomnia and AUD. CBT-I is the
first line of treatment for insomnia, and it has been found to improve insomnia symptoms among veterans and
other populations across a number of studies. However, very little research has examined the efficacy of CBT-I
in addressing AUD symptoms; indeed, AUD is often a criterion excluding individuals from CBT-I trials. CBT-I is
often delivered individually, in groups, or face-to-face over telehealth, yet these formats do little to reach
veterans with insomnia and AUD that do not seek behavioral health care. Therefore, we propose to beta test
and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of a promising mobile app for addressing insomnia among
veterans (Insomnia Coach), enhanced with evidence-based brief alcohol intervention content, among post 9/11
veterans with insomnia and AUD that are outside of treatment settings. The engaging and easy-to-use mobile
app integrates aspects of CBT-I with brief alcohol intervention content (e.g., drinking normative feedback,
relapse prevention strategies) to improve upon both AUD and insomnia symptoms, which often go
unaddressed in treatments focused on a single disorder, but are necessary to target in integrated treatments
due to the interplay of AUD and insomnia symptoms. This project contains four aims: (1) refine and add brief
alcohol intervention content to the popular VA-developed Insomnia Coach mobile app and test usability,
feasibility, and acceptability of the app in a beta testing phase, (2) test the efficacy of the enhanced Insomnia
Coach on alcohol use and insomnia outcomes compared to control, (3) assess mechanisms of change to learn
how and for whom the intervention works best, and (4) explore the intervention's potential to increase
treatment initiation (willingness to seek care, preparatory behaviors) among veterans with AUD who are often
difficult to engage in care due to logistical and stigma-related barriers. The unique strengths of this proposal
are its focus on an underserved population (including targeted recruitment of women and racial/ethnic minority
veterans), utilization of mobile technology for intervention delivery to overcome barriers to care, and use of a
novel integrated intervention to target both AUD and insomnia. This study intends to produce a viable,
evidence-based, and easy-to-access treatment that can have substantial impacts on substance use outcomes."
10927361,"Abstract. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) often onsets in childhood and, if not effectively treated,
can lead to lifelong illness and poor functional outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with
exposure and response prevention (EXRP) is the gold-standard, first-line treatment for children with
OCD, however, as many as 40% of pediatric patients fail to remit. EXRP requires children to deliberately
experience distress associated with their obsessions while refraining to engage in their usual compulsive
rituals aimed at reducing or neutralizing distressed. Thus, to be effective, EXRP depends on the patient's
capacity to flexibly adapt thinking and behavior, i.e., to engage cognitive control. Our preliminary data
and the extant literature show an altered capacity for cognitive control and altered functioning of
underlying task control (TC) circuits in children with OCD. This proposal leverages a child-friendly,
engaging, computerized at-home cognitive training (CT) intervention to enhance cognitive control
capacity (target engagement) to reduced symptoms and improve EXRP response in children with OCD.
In the R61 phase, CT will be delivered to 60 children (8 to 12 years) with OCD to test improvements in
behavioral markers of cognitive control; significant within-person improvement in cognition is the Go/No-
Go Criterion to progress to the R33 phase. The R61 will also probe optimal dosing as this is the first
study to test this intervention in pediatric OCD. Specifically, we will probe change in cognitive
performance after 2 and 4 weeks of training; 4 weeks is the dose previously used in children with ADHD.
The R33 will entail a double-blind randomized control trial in 120 children (8 to 12 years) with OCD.
Children will be randomized to complete the optimal dose of CT, per the R61, or a sham training
matched for experience but not targeting cognitive control. All children will then complete 12 weeks of
gold-standard manualized EXRP. This will allow us to probe how active CT engages our behavioral
target and augments response to EXRP, compared to a sham control. We will further explore changes in
task control to default mode network connectivity pre- to post-CT as a likely neural mechanism of action.
Using this CT with a novel population and evaluating how changes in neuroscience-derived targets relate
to changes in OCD symptoms in children directly responds to NIMH call for experimental therapeutics
and addresses an urgent need for novel interventions to treat OCD. Furthermore, computerized, at-home
CT represents a highly scalable intervention both to augment existing treatments as well as having
potential as an early intervention before onset of severe illness."
10766824,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vancomycin is the most commonly administered antibiotic in hospitalized patients, and a mainstay treatment
option for empiric and definitive therapy of gram-positive infections, particularly methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Patients receiving vancomycin are at risk of drug-associated acute kidney
injury (DA-AKI), which occurs in 5-43% of patients. Experimental preclinical data and observational clinical
data from our group indicate that the administration of vancomycin via continuous as opposed to intermittent
infusion (the standard of care in most institutions) reduces urinary markers of kidney injury and leads to less
DA-AKI. In order to translate these findings from the rat model, this application proposes a randomized, open-
label, clinical trial of continuous versus intermittent infusion vancomycin in hospitalized patients already
prescribed vancomycin by their treating physician in order to evaluate the change in kidney function and injury
between the two infusion strategies. Given the known limitations of serum creatinine in assessing DA-AKI, this
proposal includes measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) using iohexol, the gold-standard index of kidney
function, and other biomarkers of kidney injury and function to work toward the overall objective of testing the
impact of infusion strategy (continuous versus intermittent) on kidney function. Our central hypothesis is that
vancomycin administered as a continuous versus intermittent infusion results in less DA-AKI as assessed by
mGFR and kidney injury biomarkers. To test this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: (1)
Determine if patients randomized to receive vancomycin administered via intermittent infusion experience
greater reductions in mGFR, assessed using the gold standard plasma iohexol clearance, in the 72 hours after
therapy initiation compared to continuous infusion, (2) Determine if patients randomized to receive vancomycin
administered via intermittent infusion demonstrate greater elevations in plasma (cystatin C) and urinary (kidney
injury molecule-1, clusterin, and osteopontin) kidney biomarkers of injury and function in the 72 hours after
therapy initiation compared to continuous infusion, and (3) Compare the pharmacokinetic target attainment,
clinical safety, and tolerability of infusion strategy in patients randomized to receive vancomycin via continuous
vs. intermittent infusion. Given the millions of patients that receive vancomycin annually in the United States for
the treatment of MRSA or other gram-positive infections, the proposal aligns with NIAID’s mission of better
treating infectious diseases by optimizing the risk-benefit profile of this antibiotic. Testing this hypothesis is
crucial to translate the preclinical findings to patients, as well as determine if larger, definitive trials are needed
to test if infusion strategy improves outcomes, including safety, with vancomycin therapy."
10828860,"Project Summary
 This R21 application proposes the utilization of a novel non-invasive real-time breathing sensor –
pneuRIP- to measure pulmonary function (PF) in children with high-level cerebral palsy. Currently the standard
measures of PF such as spirometry and peak flow meters are too strenuous for children and those with severe
CP, as a result they have low compliance rates. The pneuRIP does not require active user participation and
can passively measure PF. It consists of two inductive bands worn around the chest and abdomen that
measure and differentiate diaphragmatic and chest breathing through Respiratory Inductance
Plethysmography (RIP). Readings are recorded and analyzed on a small chest-worn unit and wirelessly
transmitted to an iPad. The pneuRIP yields indices of work of breathing (WOB) which includes the phase angle
between the chest and abdomen; percentage breathing through the ribcage; respiratory rate; and labored
breathing index. This sensor takes little time to set up and readings are provided instantaneously.
 The WOB indices provide a screening tool for pulmonary diagnosis and treatment, decrease the risk for
pneumonia and respiratory illness, and has the potential to act as a marker for scoliosis in children with high-
level CP. Our research team (clinicians, basic scientists, bioengineers & therapists) has shown the
effectiveness of the proposed PF methodology in both intensive care, emergency departments, operating
rooms, and neuromuscular clinics.
 The impact on the field will be to have a simple and fast way to measure pulmonary function in children
and adults with severe CP and correlate this to measures of function and scoliosis severity as the effects of
scoliosis, which is common in CP, on pulmonary function is unclear. Measures of motor function are classified
by the Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS), ranking from I to V, with worsening disability
from near normal gait in Type I to complete wheelchair use in Type V. This project will address GMFCS levels
IV and V which includes people using wheelchairs. The two specific aims are a) Measure WOB indices non-
invasively using the pneuRIP sensor in children with CP who use a wheelchair (GMFCS level IV, V) and
validate the use of WOB indices as a screening test for pulmonary dysfunction., 2) Determine the correlation
between WOB indices and the degree of scoliosis using the pneuRIP sensor in 250 children with CP who use
a wheelchair (GMFCS level IV, V). The proposed research is innovative because this RIP technology to date
has not been incorporated in the diagnosis and treatment of children with CP. The advantages include
provision of the diagnostic data in real-time, less stress to the patients, and a reduction in lab testing and
imaging. Collectively, we expect the outcomes of these clinical studies will greatly add to pulmonary treatment
in CP."

Bullying is defined as intentional aggressive behavior that typically occurs repeatedly over time in the context
of a power differential.1,2 It is a public health concern3,4 because of its high prevalence and the deleterious
impacts on children’s social-emotional wellbeing, academic achievement, and health.5-8 In the school setting,
bullying can be inadvertently condoned through teacher non-response or ineffective responses to aggressive
and bullying behaviors.9-11 Teachers play a pivotal role during late childhood (i.e., elementary school) because
students are often with the same teacher most of the day, allowing for more opportunities to shape their social
development.12 Late childhood is also a key developmental period when bullying increases and shifts to more
covert behaviors that are difficult for teachers to detect.13-15 Though there are widespread mandates to address
bullying in schools16, programming is often aimed at students’ behaviors or brief professional development
(PD) for teachers. These PDs do not focus specifically on key knowledge, attitudes, and skills related to the
specific role that school staff play in creating a positive social emotional climate through behavior management
and preventing and intervening with bullying. Therefore, to address these critical gaps in bullying prevention
programming our team developed and piloted the Bullying Classroom Check-Up (BCCU).17-19 The BCCU
enhances bullying prevention programming beyond the typical student-focused approach. It is an innovative,
collaborative, and data-informed bullying prevention model that includes group-based professional
development for all school staff and one-on-one coaching that rigorously supports classroom teachers in
preventing, detecting, and intervening with bullying behaviors. The BCCU incorporates one-on-one coaching
using an adapted version of the Classroom Check-Up20, which leverages motivational interviewing to empower
teacher practice changes, as well as the mixed-reality TeachLivE© simulator21, and PD Modules. The BCCU
was tested in a 78 teacher, classroom- randomized trial within 5 middle schools (NIJ grant: 2015-CK-BX-0008)
and demonstrated improved teacher attitudes and skills in bullying detection and intervention.17 To avoid prior
design challenges and prevent contamination, this study will utilize a more rigorous school-level, cluster
randomized controlled trial.22 This 32 elementary school trial, conducted in the Baltimore metro area and
Philadelphia across 5 years, will examine BCCU effects on 3rd to 5th grade students’ reports of bullying
prevalence (i.e., perpetration, victimization, and witnessing) as well as the general bullying climate, sense of
safety, and positive bystander responses both at post-test and in the next school year. We will also examine
the effects of the BCCU on teacher skills/efficacy as well student-teacher and student-student relationships
across two school years. Finally, we will explore the role of fidelity as a moderator of main outcomes and the
mediating role of teacher self-efficacy and behavior management practices on distal child outcomes."
10889215,"Project Summary/Abstract – Evaluating Modes of Influenza Transmission using a Randomized
Controlled Trial
The “Evaluating Modes of Influenza Transmission using a Randomized Controlled Trial (EMIT-2-RCT)”
research project addresses a key knowledge gap, the lack of definitive evidence regarding the mechanisms of
transmission, in particular the importance of viral aerosols (airborne or aerosol transmission) as compared with
contact - fomite and sprayborne (also called droplet) transmission. The overall objective of this project is to
evaluate how viral aerosol shedding and ventilation interact to facilitate human-to-human influenza
transmission and provide insights into correlates of protection in the setting of absent or low hemagglutination
inhibiting (HI) antibodies using a novel study design. In doing so, we directly address objective 1.1 of the NIAID
strategic plan. Our central hypothesis is that infectious aerosols are a major contributor to influenza
transmission and that ventilation and reduced aerosol exposure are associated with reduction of both attack
rates and disease severity. We are uniquely positioned to quantify infectious exhaled breath aerosols with the
Gesundheit-II previously developed in the PI’s lab and to extend these measurements in collaboration with a
highly multidisciplinary team. We will comprehensively evaluate exposure via direct contact, fomites,
sprayborne drops, and aerosols as factors facilitating transmission by conducting a novel randomized
controlled trial of seven groups with 4 naturally infected Donors and 18 Recipients per group. The Clinical and
Biostatistics Core will provide the infrastructure to recruit and screen the participants and the clinical oversight
of the quarantine facility. Within each group, we will randomize half of the Recipients to a hand hygiene–face
shield intervention. The first group in year-1 will be in a low ventilation environment. In years 2-4 we will
conduct two exposure groups per year, one in a low ventilation environment and one in a high ventilation
environment with upper-room germicidal UV air sanitation. Specifically, we will: (1) Identify the dominant mode
of transmission using naturally infected Donors with community acquired infection in a randomized controlled
trial of air sanitation-ventilation and hand hygiene–face shield interventions; (2) Determine the impact of
aerosol exposure on disease severity; and (3) Investigate the impact of serologic and mucosal antibody levels
on influenza transmission, susceptibility and immunologic response to infection in the setting of absent or very
low levels of hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies. This unique randomized controlled trial will provide a
definitive assessment of the role of aerosols in transmission and provide critical data on which to build effective
non-pharmaceutical interventions and assess efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic impacts on transmission."
10889221,"Our current scientific knowledge indicates the importance of influenza transmission via exhaled viral bioaerosols
over short and long ranges in indoor environments. The turbulent nature of indoor airflows coupled with the
dynamic nature of exhaled bioaerosol sources and the poor understanding of fundamental source terms
(including distribution of infective virus by aerosol size and number of viral particles per aerosol) creates
difficulties in predicting and tracking aerosol-driven transmission. To address this challenge, novel sampling,
collection, and infective virus assay technologies developed in the Advanced Bioaerosol Technology Core
(ABTC) will allow the Clinical and Biostatistics Core (CBC) and Research Project 1 (RP1) to design and
implement a cohort study capable of collecting critical data sets from both the cohort human subject exhaled
breath and the controlled environment of the clinical facility where the cohort study will take place. Based on
these critical datasets, Research Project 2 (RP2) will develop both well-mixed and high-fidelity analytical models
for deployment in other cohort studies and physical tracking of viral bioaerosol from cohort donors to the
recipients. This direct physical bioaerosol link is important to track actual exposure of recipients to viral
bioaerosols based on both data and high -fidelity models. Furthermore, this link will enable translation of both
cohort data and high-fidelity model results into well-mixed analytical models capable of accounting of quanta
(dose) for modeling of risk of influenza transmission. A careful design of the cohort study experiment setup in
the clinical facility is the first aim in this RP2 project (Aim 1). The setup design will include on-site data collection
on ventilation rates and installation of environmental controls with UV air disinfection. Furthermore,
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models will allow to define a face shield shape that will block sprayborne
exposure with minimal impact on aerosols. The cohort study in RP1 will use both the identified face shield shape
and the environmental controls for the interventions. The data from the intervention cohort studies will support
the second aim in RP2 focused on analytical modeling of aerosol-driven transmission of influenza (Aim 2). In
this most important aim of RP2, we will characterize the quanta (dose) that resulted in recipient cases of
influenza, allowing us to link the dose to both bioaerosol shedding rate from exhaled breath measurements and
environment aerosol fate. The aerosol concentration and ultimately aerosol fate will be available through
validated high-fidelity modeling of temporal and spatial distributions of bioaerosols. A rigorous validation process
of our high-fidelity models will use both continuously monitored environmental data (CO2, temperature, humidity)
and viral bioaerosol data. These unique data sets will allow the team to create different type of influenza
transmission models to distinguish between the short and long range bioaerosols. The final step is to extend our
analytical models to other environments such as household cohort and ferret influenza studies. RP2 will provide
both analytical models and a web-based tool for user-friendly access in the field."
10788444,"Abstract
 Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a fatal, progressive adult-onset disease characterized by
autonomic and motor dysfunction with widespread CNS demyelination. We have previously shown that ADLD is
caused by duplications of the lamin b1 gene and that increased expression of lamin B1 underlies the disease
process. In eukaryotic cells, lamin B1 is a major constituent of the nuclear lamina, a fibrous meshwork adjacent
to the inner nuclear membrane. We have demonstrated that transgenic (TG) mice with oligodendrocyte specific
over-expression of lamin B1 exhibit severe vacuolar demyelination of the spinal cord that result in age dependent
degenerative phenotypes that recapitulate the salient features of ADLD.
 The late age of onset of the together with the relatively slow progression of the disease provides a large
therapeutic window for the disorder. However, no treatment exits for ADLD, representing an urgent and unmet
clinical need. This proposal aims to test the hypothesis that reducing lamin B1 levels can delay or reverse the
progression of the disease in a a novel mouse model we have generated where the overexpression of Lamin B1
can be inducibly downregulated. We propose to fully characterize this mouse model and downregulate
overexpression at time points before and after the onset of disease to determine if this will mitigate the
pathological phenotype. These experiments will provide the first clear evidence that reducing Lamin B1 levels is
a viable therapeutic strategy in an ADLD pre-clinical model."

Osteomyelitis due to orthopaedic device-related infections (ODRIs), is a major complication in orthopaedic
medicine, resulting in approximately 200,000 cases in the US per year (~3% of the estimated 6 million elective
orthopaedic surgeries), and is predicted to rise as the US population ages. Current treatment requires 4 to 6
weeks of IV antibiotic administration and multiple surgeries to remove the infected implants and surrounding
tissue and restore the device, resulting in a large economic burden and significant patient morbidity. ODRIs are
extremely recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment as these are biofilm infections, in which the bacterial pathogens
are attached to surfaces surrounded by a self-produced matrix. A hallmark of biofilms is their resistance to
antibiotics and the host immune system. Furthermore, antibiotics administered orally or parenterally
(intravenously or through intramuscular injection) have poor bone penetration. Another treatment complication
is the rise in ODRIs due to antibiotic- and multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. Local delivery of antibiotics by
their incorporation into polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) beads has improved treatment. We developed and
tested a local antibiotic delivery system of biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres that
retain the advantages of PMMA antibiotic delivery, but do not require removal. An emerging strategy to treat
MDR infections is to directly target and lyse the bacterial pathogen using IV administration of bacteriophage
(viruses that kill bacteria) or `phage'. Phage self-replicate at the site of infection, do not share resistance
mechanisms with antibiotics, and may even restore bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. As IV phage
administration has drawbacks including the loss of phage during delivery and long-term exposure to the
immune system, we propose here an innovative nanotechnology strategy using our biodegradable delivery
system to locally administer lytic phage to treat ODRIs.
We have recently demonstrated that phage K, which effectively lyses many strains of Staphylococcus aureus,
the most common cause of ODRIs, can be incorporated into PLGA microspheres. Further, eluted phage are
able to kill S. aureus within in vitro biofilms on orthopaedic materials. Our long-term goal is to develop effective
local delivery of lytic phage to treat MDR ODRIs. We plan the following short-term goals: 1) optimize the phage
incorporation into PLGA microspheres, 2) generate lytic phage cocktails to treat S. aureus ODRI that eliminate
bacterial phage resistance, 3) test of the optimized phage-containing microspheres in in-vitro cell culture and
an in-vivo rat model of ODRI. It is anticipated that the investigations proposed in this application will pave the
way for clinical trials using local delivery of lytic phage to treat ODRI infections thereby improving patient
outcomes."

This proposal presents the Intermountain West-Atlantic Center (InterACT), which brings together four robust
investigative sites to participate in the APS Phenotypes Consortium. InterACT proposes to use robust
statistical and machine learning methods to phenotype patients with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome
(ARDS), pneumonia, and sepsis in two broad proposals. In the first proposal for the entire Consortium, we will
use multiplex cytokine arrays and clinical variables in the setting of normalized treatment trajectories to
improve the accuracy of phenotyping by accounting for the role treatment plays. This method creates
phenotypes that will be confirmed, with an eye toward therapeutic implications, in emulated clinical trials. In the
second proposal for the Center specifically, we will focus our statistical methodology on new work investigating
the pattern of tissue injury and repair, with a focus on hyaluronan and soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation
Endproducts (sRAGE) as tissue injury biomarkers and predictors of dysregulated inflammation. This work will
culminate in emulated trials of novel agents that modulate the pathologic consequences of tissue injury.
Together these highly innovative proposals promise actionable, treatment-responsive patient phenotypes for
future clinical trials."

Challenges. Despite being curable when caught early, cervical cancer remains the second leading cause of
death in women living in sub-Saharan Africa. Even with available screening technologies (cytology, visual
inspection with acetic acid (VIA), and sometimes high-risk Human Papillomavirus [hrHPV] testing), only
10-20% of eligible women in low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) are currently screened. Barriers cited
include technical expertise, laboratory capacity, cost, and access. Most developed countries have adopted
PCR-based HPV screening, furthering the resource divide with LMICs, where 80% of cancer deaths occur.
Innovation. In dire response to the diagnostic gaps unveiled by the pandemic, team members within our group
developed and validated in human specimens a robust and frugal technology to detect nucleic acid targets.
The approach, CRISPR Optical Detection of Anisotropy or CODA, combines CRISPR/Cas (a Nobel Prize-
winning technology for highly precise gene editing) with ﬂuorescence anisotropy (differential rotational motion
of ﬂuorescent molecules). Automated nucleic acid readouts are generated in < 30 minutes. We have adopted
this technology for: a) the detection of DNA and RNA markers of CIN2+; and b) reliable use by clinicians and
clinical lab personnel in point-of-care settings. Our plan for this proposal is to operationalize this technology for
low resource settings, notably our partner sites in Uganda and Ghana, with close LMIC input. We will then
leverage CODA and other parameters to create a panel of tests to optimally detect CIN2+ in a single
encounter. Aim 1: Construct a robust CODA platform for comprehensive HPV screening. Aim 2: Further
examine CODA performance on human specimens and reﬁne for LMIC operations. Aim 3: Develop a novel
and rapid multi-modal algorithm for screen and treat in LMICs. Impact. Given CODA's core strengths in nucleic
acid analyses (e.g., DNA or RNA), we envision an approach that yields fully quantitive readouts of high-risk
HPV DNA and E6, E7, and p16 mRNA. Since the CODA assay underlies all readouts driving this proposal, a
high potential exists for end-user-friendly, practical, and rapid triage of high-risk cervical disease or invasive
cancer. These beneﬁts could help decentralize and harmonize screening efforts with those guidelines currently
endorsed by resource-rich countries."

Advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing now enable large-scale experiments that
systematically explore how sequence variation affects molecular and cellular function.
Transcriptional regulation has proven particularly amenable to massively parallel experiments
that have revealed how sequence variation affects the activities of promoters and enhancers as
well as transcription factors. These experiments have relied on high-throughput sequencing of
the mRNAs produced during transcription as a direct read-out of regulatory activity. This
elegant approach cannot be directly extended to study other important modes of biological
regulation, however.
Post-translational protein modiﬁcation underlies nearly all cell signaling pathways. Despite its
importance, we lack general approaches to assess how sequence variation affects post-
translational regulation. We will address this gap with a broadly applicable strategy to link
protein modiﬁcations, such as phosphorylation or regulated degradation, with a deep
sequencing readout. Here we propose to develop this technique and validate it by
demonstrating how protein-level regulation is affected by variation in the target protein, the
modifying enzyme, and the broader genetic context of the cell."

 This is a clinical observational study that will fill an important gap in our understanding of how marijuana
use, and secondhand exposure, impact cardiovascular health. A likely consequence of marijuana legalization
is that intentional smoking of cannabis, and involuntary secondhand exposure, will greatly increase in coming
years. While some retrospective human association studies have failed to find clear-cut associations between
marijuana smoking and cardiovascular disease, other studies have indicated that marijuana use increases the
risk of subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure. It is unclear whether these adverse effects are
caused by the cannabinoids or the smoke. Nonetheless, despite public awareness that tobacco smoke is
harmful, many people still assume that marijuana smoke is benign. Moreover, cardiovascular effects of
secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure have remained relatively unexplored in human studies. There is
increasing evidence in rats that both active marijuana smoking and marijuana SHS exposure causes vascular
endothelial dysfunction. While the endothelial dysfunction is transient, clinical studies have shown that not only
do tobacco smokers have endothelial dysfunction, but repeated exposures to SHS lead to chronic dysfunction
as well. Therefore, it is important to determine in humans if chronic active or passive marijuana smoking
similarly causes endothelial dysfunction.
 The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that active use of marijuana, or secondhand exposure, causes
adverse cardiovascular consequences in humans. The overarching goal is to test this hypothesis by measur-
ing a panel of functional indicators and circulating biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, in otherwise healthy sub-
jects who are actively or passively exposed on a regular basis in their daily lives to cannabis (this proposal
does not involve exposing humans to cannabis). The impact is that an improved understanding of the adverse
cardiovascular effects of intentional or involuntary exposure to cannabis will better inform personal health
behavior, advice of physicians to their patients, public health policy decisions, legal doctrines, and potential
regulation of the cannabis industry and its products. Aim 1 is to determine if vascular function is impaired by
chronic active or passive marijuana smoking in otherwise healthy individuals (age ≤50), relative to tobacco
smokers and to people who avoid exposure to tobacco and marijuana. Aim 2 is to determine if these chronic
exposure conditions increase biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in the blood. Aim 3 is to determine if cultured
endothelial cells incubated in sera from exposed individuals undergo adverse functional changes relative to
non-users’ sera, indicating potential mechanisms by which vascular function is being impaired by exposure to
these products."

Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are inborn errors of metabolism that affect approximately 1 in 35,000 people and
are caused by genetic defects in one of the eight urea cycle genes. Genetic defects in any of the eight genes
can cause hyperammonemia which is the primary contributor to disease pathophysiology, leading to
neurological injury that ranges from mild executive functioning deficits to profound intellectual and
developmental disabilities and even death. Hyperammonemia is most pronounced in deficiencies of the first
three enzymes of the urea cycle: N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), carbamylglutamate synthetase 1
(CPS1), and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC). Because of the broad spectrum of neuropsychological
sequelae associated with UCDs, understanding their molecular basis and improving their early diagnosis are
among NICHD high research priorities. This application is from an existing UCD variant curation expert panel
(VCEP), which submitted OTC specific variant classification rules to ClinGen’s Sequence Variant Interpretation
Working Group for review and has been developing NAGS and CPS1 specific variant classification rules. We
are seeking support for expert curation of almost 1,300 OTC, NAGS and CPS1 clinically actionable variants
that have been deposited in public databases and reported in the literature. Establishment of a comprehensive,
expertly-curated catalogue of OTC, NAGS and CPS1 variants is essential for accurate diagnosis of the three
UCDs.
We have assembled a VCEP that includes experienced genetic counselors and genetics trainees as variant
curators, and members of the Urea Cycle Disorders Consortium (UCDC) as expert reviewers. UCDC is an
international research collaboration of health professionals with specialized expertise in diagnosis and clinical
care of patients with UCDs. In Aim 1, we will assign expert-reviewed clinical significance to OTC, NAGS and
CPS1 variants in ClinVar, other public sources of disease associated sequence variants, and in published case
reports. Variant will be curated in the following order: complete loss of function (null) variants, missense
variants affecting residues critical for enzyme function, variants identified in multiple probands, NAGS and
CPS1 variants in trans with existing pathogenic variants, variants affecting the same residues as existing
pathogenic missense variants, then all other missense variants. In Aim 2, we will annually review the literature
for new reports of patients with NAGS, CPS1 or OTC deficiency and new data regarding sequence variation in
large populations. We will utilize the new evidence for reassessment of variants with potential for
reclassification (e.g., uncertain significance to likely pathogenic or pathogenic, or likely benign to benign).
Expert classification of OTC, NAGS and CPS1 variants will improve diagnosis and clinical actionability for
variants with clear relationship with the disease. This will benefit patients, treating physicians and diagnostic
laboratories."
10815794,"Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) prevalence increases with age and affects over 13.2% of the US
population by 2020. Studies show that microbiota composition and their metabolic genes are
different between healthy and T2D patients. However, it is challenging to unravel their causal
effects on host glucose homeostasis and T2D due to the lack of an efficient system to manipulate
their levels in vivo. Recently, we were able to toggle microbiota amino acid metabolic pathways
in vivo and found that some pathways affect host glucose homeostasis. We hypothesize that the
gut bacteria impact the host amino acid pool, which will further modulate host glucose
homeostasis. Herein we will identify the microbes that actively ferment dietary amino acids and
evaluate how they affect host glucose homeostasis in diseased mouse models. We will learn
more about the role of microbiota-mediated AA metabolism in the progress of T2D. Our work will
also lay the ground for generating a synthetic and engineered gut microbial community with
defined metabolic functions to prevent and cure T2D. There are three convergent motivations:
First, many microbiota molecular features are different between healthy and T2D patients, and
we need functional studies to causally connect them with T2D. We will combine bioinformatics,
metabolomics, bacterial genetics, and a gnotobiotic mouse model to modulate microbiome
metabolic pathways in the host. This approach will boost a systematic identification of T2D-
causing microbiota genes and pathways; our findings will also promote new therapeutic strategies
by targeting these previously unknown microbial metabolic avenues.
Second, gut microbiota metabolism significantly impacts host metabolic health. However, the
molecular mechanisms behind how microbiota regulates host amino acid homeostasis and
downstream biology remain largely unexplored. We believe that this approach has huge potential:
it can be used to regulate the microbiome metabolic functions at different body sites where host
and microbes interact. Our finding would also open the door to interrogating – and ultimately
controlling – one of the most concrete contributions that gut bacteria make to host biology.
Third, a synthetic microbial community with a defined and programmable metabolic function has
therapeutic potential for T2D. The gut microbiome is part of our ‘pan-genome,’ whose metabolic
functions are more tractable by genetic manipulation or adjusting microbiota composition. Our
approach will expedite the genomic and biological characterization of microbiota metabolic genes,
laying the basis for a synthetic community with a defined and programmable metabolic function
to prevent and cure T2D and other age-related metabolic diseases."
10806222,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The establishment of synaptic connectivity during brain development involves the initial formation of an
overabundance of synapses followed by a refinement process in which some of these synapses are maintained
while others are eliminated. The precise elimination of excess synapses is driven by sensory experience during
critical periods of early postnatal life. Impairments in sensory-dependent synapse elimination contribute to
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism, underscoring the importance of this process for the proper
development and function of neural circuits. However, although neurodevelopmental disorders are growing in
prevalence at an alarming rate, therapeutic strategies for treating them are scarce in part due to a lack of insight
into the factors that control synapse elimination in the healthy brain. A key goal of this proposal is to uncover
novel cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the elimination of synapses downstream of experience,
thereby laying the groundwork for new therapeutic approaches to treat disorders of postnatal brain development.
 Work in the visual system of the mouse has revealed that non-neuronal brain cells, predominantly
microglia and astrocytes, coordinate synapse elimination before the onset of visual experience by phagocytosing
excess synapses. However, data suggest that these cells may not be major regulators of synapse elimination
during late phases of development that are coordinated by visual experience. On the contrary, we recently
discovered a key role for a less well understood class of glia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), in
eliminating synapses in response to experience through synaptic phagocytosis. This result is consistent with
wide-spread speculation that OPCs, while predominantly appreciated for their differentiation into mature
oligodendrocytes, play key roles in the brain beyond myelination. In line with this possibility, our data suggest
that OPCs are essential for shaping functional neural circuits during the maturation of the brain.
 In this application, we propose a multi-disciplinary strategy to test the hypothesis that the engulfment of
synapses by OPCs is a core mechanism underlying the sensory-dependent elimination of functional synapses
in the developing brain. In Aim 1, we will employ viral and transgenic tools to characterize the spatio-temporal
dynamics and activity-dependent basis of synaptic engulfment by OPCs using in vivo two-photon microscopy. In
Aim 2, we will apply physiological and behavioral assays to determine the consequences of synaptic engulfment
by OPCs on brain function in the intact animal. In Aim 3, we will merge unbiased transcriptomic and CRISPR-
based screening techniques with a candidate-based approach focused on the phagocytic receptor Lrp1 to reveal
molecular pathways underlying the engulfment of synapses by OPCs. Altogether, we expect these studies to
establish synapse engulfment by OPCs as a new mechanism linking experience to neural circuit development,
and to lay the foundation for future studies geared toward modifying OPC function as a potential therapeutic
strategy for treating neurodevelopmental disorders."
10870186,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic lung disease is a leading cause of disability and death, in large part because it is often diagnosed after
irreversible lung damage has occurred. The American Lung Association (ALA) Lung Health Cohort (LHC) was
funded by NHLBI to elucidate factors associated with peak lung health and the early deviations from lung
health that may progress to chronic lung disease. The LHC will be collecting spirometry, nasal epithelial
transcriptome, and CT imaging, alongside comprehensive environmental exposure, socio-behavioral, fitness,
and residential history in a nation-wide cohort of 4000 young adults between the ages of 25 and 35. Despite
this wealth of information, there is concern that the earliest stages of disease may go undetected in the LHC,
as early disease is thought to originate in the most distal airspaces, regions which the LHC testing regimen is
unable to probe. To that end, we are proposing an ancillary study to the Lung Health Cohort in which we aim to
collect hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI in a subset of LHC participants. Hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI (Xe-MRI) is a novel
imaging technique that can be used to measure lung structure and function. Specifically, Xe-MRI can be used
to image airway function (“ventilation imaging”), alveolar-airspace size (“diffusion imaging”), and pulmonary gas
exchange (“gas exchange imaging”). Notably, these imaging techniques are able to prove structure and
function in the smallest airspaces of the lungs. As such, Xe-MRI is expected to be sensitive to the earliest
manifestations of pulmonary disease and thus complements the information being acquired by the LHC. In this
sub-study, we will use Xe-MRI to image 260 LHC participants across 6 of the 17 sites involved in the parent
LHC. In aim 1, we will use Xe-MRI diffusion imaging to assess the pulmonary microstructure in LHC
participants with low normal (<85% predicted) lung function. By doing so, we aim to determine the structural
basis of deviations from peak lung health. In aim 2, we will use Xe-MRI to assess pulmonary structure and
function in LHC participants with respiratory symptoms (cough, sputum, wheeze, dyspnea). By doing so, we
aim to elucidate structural and functional determinants of respiratory symptoms that are poorly explained by
clinical markers such as spirometry and CT imaging. The expected outcome of this study is to identify
structural and functional abnormalities that are associated with the clinically measurable deviations from peak
lung health (low normal lung function and respiratory symptoms). Such information will ultimately provide a
treatable target for these individuals. Moreover, as the LHC intends to follow participants longitudinally, we
expect to be able to link early structural and functional abnormalities to the development of chronic lung
disease. Ultimately, our ability to measure lung structure and function using Xe-MRI in young adults at the
ages of peak lung health will enable the identification of disease prior to the development of irreversible lung
damage, allowing clinicians to transition from palliation to prevention of chronic lung disease."
10809652,"Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common epilepsy syndrome in adults. Current treatment options
for TLE remain often inadequate, as many patients suffer from uncontrolled seizures and negative treatment
side effects. Endogenous cannabinoid signaling involving the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) is
recognized to be a major presynaptic regulator of inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA release throughout the
CNS. However, although the therapeutic potential of endo- and exogenous cannabinoids has been
recognized for various neurological and psychiatric disorders, the in vivo mechanisms of cannabinoid
signaling remain poorly understood, limiting the effective design of novel therapies. Major reasons for our
incomplete understanding of cannabinoid signaling in the intact brain include the highly unstable nature of
lipid-derived cannabinoid ligands and the prior lack of methods to study CB1-expressing neurons in behaving
animals. Recently, we have introduced new tools that overcome these challenges, finally offering
researchers both the ability to detect fast lipid signals in the hippocampus of behaving mice, and to
selectively monitor and manipulate CB1-expressing GABAergic cells in vivo. Here, we propose to employ
these new tools to test the hypothesis that activity-dependent endocannabinoid dynamics in the intact
hippocampus are persistently modified in chronic TLE. We will then leverage novel, non-invasive, closed-
loop interventions to target CB1-expressing GABAergic cells in order to control chronic seizures and
ameliorate TLE-related disturbances in spatial information processing. We will test our hypothesis in
experimental mouse models of chronic TLE, utilizing a variety of innovative in vivo calcium-imaging,
electrophysiology, optogenetic and behavioral approaches. We anticipate that our project will have
significant, potentially translatable, impact by overcoming major knowledge gaps about activity-dependent
cannabinoid signaling in normal and epileptic neuronal circuits in behaving animals, and by accelerating the
development of non-invasive closed-loop intervention strategies."
10896920,"Genetic instability is a hallmark of cancer. The cell has evolved an intricate set of pathways that sense and
repair DNA damage, which is an inevitable consequence of cellular metabolism and the environment. Failure
of a repair pathway, due to either overwhelming DNA damage or pathway inactivation by somatic or inherited
mutations, can lead to the propagation of genetic errors that confer a selective advantage to the cell and drive
the development of cancer. Among the many DNA repair pathways, those that respond to lesions on both
strands of the DNA are particularly important, as their failure can lead to chromosomal instability that can
accelerate the loss of tumor suppressor genes and the amplification of oncogenes. Such lesions include DNA
double strand breaks (DSBs) and stalled replication forks, which are DNA structures arising during the
duplication of the genome. The objective of this proposal is to understand how the cell senses DSBs and
stalled forks, and how it triggers a response with wide-ranging effects that include arrest of cell growth and
initiation of repair programs. We plan to use the method of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine
the 3-dimensional structures of protein assemblies involved in these processes. Structural information –
essentially detailed images – will help us better understand how these pathways work, how they fail in cancer,
and may ultimately help identify new approaches to intervene therapeutically. Central to the sensing of a
stalled replication fork is the ATR protein kinase that signals to other proteins by phosphorylating them. ATR
and its partner ATRIP sense persistent single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a dsDNA-ssDNA junction – two
defining features of a stalled fork. The ssDNA is coated by the replication protein RPA, which recruits ATR-
ATRIP. The dsDNA-ssDNA junction is sensed by another protein complex that loads a clamp, termed 9-1-1,
onto dsDNA. 9-1-1 then recruits the TopBP1 protein, which binds to ATR-ATRIP and turns on the
phosphorylation activity. This is one assembly, reconstituted from purified proteins, that we plan to investigate
with cryo-EM. We also plan to investigate a related assembly, where TopBP1 is replaced with the ETAA1
protein, and which senses different features of a stalled fork. Another aspect we plan to investigate is the
remodeling of the stalled fork to facilitate its sensing and repair, and its protection during this process. These
functions are carried out by 12 FANC proteins mutated in the inherited Fanconi Anemia Cancer predisposition
syndrome. FANCM remodels the fork and recruits a 9-protein complex (FA Core complex) that puts a clamp
consisting of FANCI and FANCD2 onto the DNA, likely to protect the fork. The sensing of DSBs is mediated by
ATM, protein kinase mutated in the cancer syndrome Ataxia-Telangiectasia. DSB ends, together with a 3-

understand how this process works at the level of 3-dimensional structure."

 Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a complex genetic and epigenetic
disease caused by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array at chromosome
4q35, which leads to aberrant and pathogenic expression of the DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle.
The most direct path to an FSHD therapy is eliminating expression of DUX4 mRNA.
Importantly, data from clinically affected and asymptomatic FSHD subjects support that any
reduction in DUX4 expression will have therapeutic benefit.
 CRISPR/Cas9 technology has been used extensively to modify specific genomic
regions, offering the potential for permanent correction of many diseases. While the dangers
associated with standard CRISPR editing are of particular concern in a repetitive region such as
the FSHD locus, the use of CRISPR to repress gene expression is ideally suited to FSHD. We
have shown that CRISPR inhibition (CRISPRi) consisting of dead Cas9 fused to a small
transcriptional inhibitor can repress expression of DUX4 in FSHD myocytes, providing proof-of-
principle that the pathogenic repeat can be successfully targeted and repressed. However, an
effective therapy will require both efficient delivery of therapeutic components to skeletal
muscles and long-term repression of the disease locus. To address these needs, we re-
engineered our CRISPRi platform to allow in vivo delivery of larger and more powerful
epigenetic repressors. We designed an FSHD-optimized regulatory cassette to drive the
smaller dCas9 ortholog from S. aureus (dSaCas9) fused to four different epigenetic repressors
(HP1, HP1, the MeCP2 transcriptional repression domain, or the SUV39H1 SET domain) that
were previously too large to fit into AAV vectors. Targeting these factors to the DUX4 promoter
or exon 1 returns the chromatin at the FSHD locus to a more normal state of repression,
reducing expression of DUX4 and its target genes with no deleterious effects on the muscle
transcriptome. In this proposal, we will undertake the first in vivo assessment of a CRISPR-
based approach to treating FSHD, using new vectors in which all CRISPRi components are
contained within single therapeutic cassettes. These will be tested in cultured primary FSHD
myocytes and in two FSHD mouse models that provide complementary advantages for pre-
clinical assessment. The premise of this proposal is that AAV-mediated dCas9 targeting of
epigenetic repressors to DUX4 can effectively and stably silence the disease locus without
deleterious off-target effects. Successful completion of this project will provide the preclinical
validation for a treatment that corrects the fundamental epigenetic dysregulation in FSHD."

The recent increase in overdose deaths, fueled by an increase in opioid addiction and the availability of highly
potent opioids like fentanyl has turned opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) into a public health problem.
In addition, OIRD has long been recognized as a major risk factor in the perioperative period where it can require
intensified postoperative management or, on rare occasions, result in hypoxic injury. Total opioid dose and the
concomitant use of sedative drugs like benzodiazepines are significantly associated with an increased risk of
OIRD. Consequently, there is great urgency to develop drugs that can alleviate OIRD without reversing analgesia
or causing withdrawal. Over the past 20 years, development of respiratory stimulating drugs has been guided by
the central dogma that the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC) is the brainstem site that controls respiratory rate
and pattern generation, that OIRD is due to an effect on the preBötC, and that to counteract OIRD drugs must
stimulate the preBötC. However, drugs that were developed in animals to stimulate breathing through effects on
the preBötC were not sufficiently effective in humans. Based on our published and preliminary data we propose
a novel paradigm where the respiratory pattern is generated in the preBötC but two separate brainstem areas,
the Parabrachial Nucleus/ Kölliker-Fuse Complex (PBN/KF), and the caudal medullary raphe (CMR) contribute
excitatory drive to preBötC neurons responsible for switching in particular from expiration to inspiration and thus
determine respiratory rate. These areas are also highly sensitive to clinical opioid doses. Injection of the opioid
antagonist naloxone into these areas completely prevented OIRD, even at high opioid doses. The goal of our
study is to determine whether stimulation of neurons in the PBN/KF and CMR can overcome OIRD and whether
there are limits to this effect. We will use our adult, in vivo decerebrate rabbit preparation, which allows to
investigate opioid- and other drug effects on single neurons and in functionally identified cell nuclei without
baseline anesthesia and with neuronal networks and physiological reflexes intact. We will measure how much
opioids and other sedatives depress neuronal function in and synaptic inputs to the PBN/KF, CMR, and preBötC.
We will then test how much AMPA and NMDA receptor modulators, i.e., drugs that enhance the function of
excitatory AMPA and NMDA receptors, increase the activity of PBN/KF, CMR, and preBötC neurons, whether
this can offset the depression from opioids and sedatives and whether the effect is limited at high opioid and
sedative doses. The results will significantly improve our insights into the neuronal mechanisms of drug-induced
respiratory depression and into potential therapeutic approaches and limitations."

The goal of this proposal is to determine the type of glucocorticoids (GCs) that fosters the appropriate balance
of anti-inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression in pre-clinical models of vocal fold injury to improve outcomes
of GC therapy. GCs are used by otolaryngologists in office-based procedures to treat vocal fold disease to
reduce inflammation and promote effective wound healing, yet the optimal GC treatment regimen isn’t known.
Ideal GC therapy for laryngeal disease would not only suppress inflammation but would also induce fibroblasts
to promote laryngeal healing without excessive fibrosis that leads to scaring, vocal impairment, and poor
outcomes.
Our preliminary studies demonstrate that in vocal fold fibroblasts there are significant differences in the GC
type and concentration required to activate pro-fibrotic genes and repress pro-inflammatory genes by GR. We
hypothesize that such variability in gene expression among the three different clinically used GCs is likely to
reflect divergent GR DNA binding capacity and/or interactions with co-regulator molecules (e.g. transcriptional
co-activators and co-repressor). We further propose that understanding the type of GC that fosters the correct
balance of anti-inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression in pre-clinical models of vocal fold injury will improve
outcomes of GC therapy. To test these hypotheses we will determine the effects of three commonly employed
GCs on GR-dependent gene expression, GR chromatin occupancy, and GR chromatin-associated proteins in
vocal fold fibroblasts, and evaluate the mechanisms underlying GC therapy following iatrogenic injury in vivo.
Successful completion of the aims will provide the pre-clinical foundation for optimized GC therapy among
clinically common GCs."
10879049,"The Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh-Cardiology, Hematology and Pulmonology Summer Research Internship
Program (CHP2-SRIP) will be the premiere undergraduate research experience in the study of pediatric heart,
lung and blood/vasculature. COVID-19 has disproportionately affected Blacks, Latinx, and Native Americans,
further exposing longstanding health disparities in the U.S. Indeed, under-represented minority (URM) children
are heavily affected with heart, lung, and blood/vascular disorders. For example, Puerto Ricans and African
Americans have the highest burden of asthma of all ethnic groups in the U.S., where sickle cell disease mostly
affects African American children. Although URM physicians and scientists are more likely to care for or conduct
research in URMs, the proportion of URM students in the biomedical sciences is very low. Thus, there is a large
unmet need to train the diverse biomedical researchers to develop new and effective treatments and cures for
heart, lung and blood diseases, particularly those affecting URMs. UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP)
is well positioned to mentor, train, and motivate undergraduate URM students to become MD and/or PhD
scientists focused on research in cardiac, hematological and pulmonary disorders. In addition, there is large
unmet need to train the next generation of diverse heart, lung and blood/vascular-based researchers to develop
new and effective treatments and cures for the myriad of diseases. This program will allow students to perform
research for a 10-week period over the summer as part of the CHP2-SRIP. The pool of URM undergraduates will
come from a wide range of Universities around the country and US districts. This program will be administered
by the Department of Pediatrics and include faculty from the Pediatric cardiology, pulmonology and
hematology/oncology Divisions, Developmental Biology Department, Department of Pathology, Critical Care
Department and the School of Public Health. Members of the training faculty will provide a weekly one-hour
didactic session on a NHLBI topic followed by a 30-minute discussion on a pertinent paper and a discussion
about career options as a heart, lung or blood/vascular researcher. Furthermore, we will provide research training
under the mentorship of world-class NHLBI researchers. A multimedia platform has been developed specifically
for this program and will act as an interface for past, current and future students. CHP2-SRIP students will be
matched with one of the training faculty to pursue a research project. Given the breadth of the training faculty
research interests, students will have the opportunity to work on a laboratory-based project or a patient oriented
research project. At the end of the 10 weeks, the students will present their work as an oral presentation. Upon
completion of this summer program the students will have had exposure to a wide array of NHLBI-based research
topics, to nationally respected clinician-scientists and PhD scientists. Given that decisions about a specialty in
medicine and/or research focus often happen in early stages of training, the intent of this program is to increase
the number of trainees that will eventually become clinician-scientists or PhD scientists in these fields."

Caries is a multifactorial disease that results from an imbalance between the microbiome and the host leading
to demineralization of the dental hard tissues. After a lesion initiates in enamel, further tissue demineralization
will lead to cavitation and involvement of the dentin. The etiology of caries attributes lesion progression to diet-
and pH-dependent processes. However, enamel and dentin differ in terms of mineral content, structure and
composition, and the degradation of the organic matrix of dentin seems to be a more complex mechanism than
currently accepted. In vitro studies from the candidate’s research group and from others have shown in-
creased presence and activity of endogenous proteases, such as matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), in caries
dentin. Novel and important preliminary data suggest that while some MMPs may contribute for tissue degra-
dation, specific MMPs might be important to favor reparative processes in dentin, even though tissue repair
does not overcome degradation in advanced caries lesions. Fundamental questions remain concerning the
regulatory mechanisms that drive MMPs expression and activation and how these mechanisms respond to
bacterial infiltration as caries lesion advances. This proposal will address these issues by: (a) filling the gap in
knowledge regarding the breadth of the contribution of specific MMPs to caries lesion progression; (b) defining
the role of odontoblast-produced and dentin-released MMPs in caries; and (c) determining how the shift in the
oral microbiome can modulate MMPs expression and/or activation as the lesion progresses. These studies will
provide essential baseline information to facilitate the candidate’s long-term research goal, which is the devel-
opment of new dental therapies based on modulation of MMPs activity in caries. The candidate aims to be-
come an independent researcher to pursue the creation of novel therapeutic targets based on selective inhibi-
tion of damaging endogenous mechanisms and promotion of repair mechanisms that would fundamentally
change the way in which we manage and surgically treat dentin caries. This application for a K08 award will
provide the candidate protected time and training to support her research goals and to ensure her career de-
velopment. The candidate has assembled an outstanding group of mentor, co-mentors, collaborators, consult-
ant, and advisors with expertise in microbiology, genomics, proteomics, and bioinformatics. This K08 award
will facilitate the candidate’s career development by providing the structure and the guidance for expanding
and acquiring: (1) advanced knowledge on dentin organic matrix composition and biochemical properties in
health and caries disease, (2) experience with methodologies for the study of oral proteins and microorganisms
in caries, including genomics and proteomics, (3) skills in leadership and scientific communication including
writing, oral presentations and mentorship, and (4) the protected time and the resources to generate data and
publications to support an R01 application by the end of the award period."

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is a primary medical concern due to the increasing prevalence and high
mortality rate upon rupture. Although vascular inflammation, extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, and
subsequent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) apoptosis are pathologic features and drivers of AAA,
efforts to manipulate these processes did not yet result in any effective drug therapies beyond primary
prevention, creating an urgent need for new drug-based therapeutic strategies. This will be facilitated by a
deeper and comprehensive understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving onset,
progression, and outcomes of AAA. Chromatin remodeling altering gene expression has been linked to most
pathophysiologic conditions, including atherosclerosis and diabetes, but its role in AAA remains largely
unknown. The BAF60 family comprises three mutually exclusive subunits of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-
Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. Of relevance to the cardiovascular field, they play
essential roles in controlling lipid homeostasis, energy metabolism (BAF60a), granulocyte (BAF60b) and heart
(BAF60c) development. We found that BAF60a, b and c are differentially expressed in human and mouse AAA
tissues, suggesting a potential role of the BAF60 subunits in VSMC biology and the development of AAA. We
recently reported that loss of BAF60a in VSMCs prevents experimental AAA by reducing vascular inflammation
and ECM degradation in mice. Remarkably, BAF60c is the most abundant BAF60 subunit expressed in VSMC.
Our preliminary data show that BAF60c is downregulated in the abdominal aortic aneurysmal tissue in both
humans and mice. VSMC BAF60c knockout significantly aggravates elastase-induced AAA, and knockdown of
BAF60c in human aortic smooth muscle cells reduced the SMC contractile protein expression and increased
inflammatory genes and MMP9 expression. We hypothesize that VSMC-specific BAF60c attenuates AAA
development by maintaining the VSMC contractile phenotype, and inhibiting vascular inflammation and ECM
degradation. Using gain- and loss-of-function in HASMCs in vitro, AAA-relevant stimuli, our unique VSMC-
specific BAF60c knockout and transgenic mice, two established murine AAA models in vivo, and an integrated
workflow, we will (Aim 1) Demonstrate that VSMC-specific BAF60c attenuates AAA formation with attention to
altered cellular profiles and intercellular cross-talk by scRNAseq and provide proof-of-concept for therapeutic
targeting and (Aim 2) Determine the protective mechanisms of BAF60c in VSMC homeostasis in vitro using
relevant stimuli and RNAseq, ChIP-seq and co-immunoprecipitation. This work will provide unique mechanistic
insights on how various and varying risk factors translate into VSMC dysfunction leading to AAA and provide
the basis for developing novel therapies for AAA."

The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes impart epigenetic regulation and control accessibility of
chromatin to transcriptional machineries. Chromatin remodeling plays important roles in normal physiology and
diseases, particularly cancer. ARID1A is a component of the BAF SWI/SNF complex and a major tumor
suppressor. ARID1A is inactivated by somatic mutations in a wide spectrum of cancer types. Despite the
apparent importance of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers in cancer, their regulation by growth and oncogenic
signals remains not well understood. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is a conserved protein kinase and a central
growth controller. mTORC1 is an oncogenic driver and the target of US FDA-approved oncology drugs
rapamycin and rapamycin analogs. Our preliminary data revealed that mTORC1 promotes proteasomal
degradation of ARID1A protein. Moreover, ARID1A plays an important role in therapeutic response and
resistance to mTORC1 inhibitors. Because mTOR pathway is estimated to be activated in nearly half of all human
tumors, mTOR-dependent degradation represents a common mechanism to inactivate the ARID1A tumor
suppressor in cancer. Therefore, it is important to understand the underlying regulatory mechanisms and its role
in cancer biology and therapy. There are two specific aims in this application: Aim 1 will dissect the molecular
mechanism by which mTORC1 regulates ARID1A and oncogenic chromatin remodeling. Aim 2 will investigate
the significance of mTORC1-dependent ARID1A regulation in tumorigenesis and anticancer drug response. Our
studies are anticipated to fill a knowledge gap in the regulation of the ARID1A tumor suppressor in tumorigenesis
and anticancer drug response/resistance. If successful, this project could lead to better strategies to target mTOR
pathway, improving clinical outcomes for cancer patients."

Although Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and hearing loss often co-occur, the nature of
this relationship is still largely unknown. Many mouse models have been developed to better understand the
physiological and behavioral effects of specific ADRD-related brain pathologies, but the research on hearing
in these mice lags human studies and has not produced definitive results, with huge variability across
laboratories. One study suggested that exposure to damaging noise may exacerbate the ADRD pathology
in one ADRD model mouse strain, but other labs have not found similar effects in other mouse strains.
Further, most researchers pursuing information about hearing, hearing loss, and aging in mouse models of
ADRD utilize physiological methods in anesthetized mice or reflexive methods to assess hearing status.
While these techniques are informative, neither method accurately portrays how an awake, behaving
organism perceives the world around them. This is critical because epidemiological and audiological studies
of humans with ADRD, as well as healthy-aging humans, rely primarily on behavioral measures of hearing
dysfunction. For this reason, hearing in quiet and in noise at several time points in the mouse lifespan in
three mouse models of ADRD using behavioral psychoacoustic assessments and physiological evoked
potential techniques will be conducted. Comparisons of results from male and female mice trained with
operant conditioning and positive reinforcement to those from anesthetized and unanesthetized mice using
auditory brainstem response and middle latency response recordings will be made. Comparisons of
behavioral results to physiological measurements will provide information about whether behavioral
performance reflects central compensation processes and which physiological test conditions correspond to
behavioral deficits. These experiments will help to better appreciate how aging, sex, and noise affect
communication in mice, possibly leading to advances in understanding communication issues in human
patients suffering from ADRD."

Sepsis is an infection-initiated life-threatening medical condition accompanied by severe whole-body
inflammation. Over 1.7 million sepsis survivors are now discharged from the hospital annually, and a majority
of them report reduced quality of life due to considerable long-term dysfunction, called chronic critical illness,
including muscle weakness and cognitive impairment after hospital discharge. We previously developed a
clinically relevant murine sepsis-survivor model with an ICU-like resuscitation procedure that enables us to
evaluate long-term muscle quality and function after recovery from sepsis. Our studies demonstrated that
sepsis-survivor mice exhibit significant skeletal muscle weakness. Skeletal muscles from these sepsis-survivor
mice also show profound mitochondrial structural and functional defects. In contrast to muscle dysfunction,
little is known for cognitive dysfunction in sepsis survivors. Although there are several published studies using
laboratory animal models for this issue, their results remain inconclusive due to several limitations; 1) cognitive
impairment being assessed by stressful swimming maze tests which sepsis survivors perform poorly due to
muscle weakness; 2) use of surgical sepsis models with artifactual necrosis and resulting systemic
inflammation; and 3) the lack of antibiotics treatment and the lack of confirmation of sepsis recovery, thereby
focusing on dysfunction “during sepsis” rather than “post-sepsis”, all limit current research. Importantly, all
these limitations are resolved in our above-mentioned sepsis-survivor mouse model that confirms complete
recovery from sepsis, allows sufficient duration (4 weeks or longer) after sepsis to study long term effects, and
eliminates surgical procedures to avoid artifactual necrosis and inflammation. Thus, our well-refined sepsis-
survivor mouse model for muscle weakness can potentially be an appropriate animal model to investigate post-
sepsis long-term cognitive impairment. Our major hypothesis is that this sepsis-survivor model will exhibit long-
term cognitive impairment. We also hypothesize that ApoE4 gene polymorphism, the most common AD-
susceptible genotype, confers a higher risk of developing cognitive dysfunction after surviving sepsis.
Additionally, we hypothesize that mitochondrial abnormalities are involved in such post-sepsis cognitive
impairment. To test these hypotheses, two Specific Aims will be pursued. (1) To test whether wild type
mice develop long-term cognitive impairment after sepsis; and (2) To test whether mutant mice
carrying the human ApoE4 gene polymorphism have a higher risk of developing cognitive impairment
after sepsis."

Variation in the maternal genome alters the way offspring are provisioned and changes many aspects of their
development. These changes in development have cascading effects on the offspring phenotype, life-history,
and fitness. Maternal effects have long been recognized as a major factor in development, and the naturally
occurring variation across maternal backgrounds has profound potential to alter developmental fates. However,
the specific mechanisms and genetic loci involved remain poorly understood. Recently, maternal genetic
effects have been recognized as a major contributor to human health and development through maternal-by-
zygotic epistatic interactions. Here I use Streblospio benedicti, an emerging model, to understand how
maternal genetic effects influence the evolution of developmental programs. S. benedicti produces two
distinct offspring types that differ in egg size, embryogenesis, and larval development. Thus, S. benedicti is an
intraspecific model for the evolutionarily common transition between indirect and direct development, and it
remains the only known organism to have two heritable offspring types. Using S. benedicti I have shown that a
transition from indirect to direct development requires the independent evolution and coordination of both
maternal and zygotic genomes. Recent advances in transgenics and sequencing technologies have made
research on emerging models feasible, and I developed molecular and genomic tools in S. benedicti to answer
these crucial questions; I have constructed the genetic map, a fully assembled and annotated genome,
transcriptome databases, and methods for making transgenics. The research in this proposal will be the
first to investigate the intraspecific genetic basis for evolutionary developmental transitions and will
answer long-standing questions of the role of the maternal genome in shaping developmental
program. Here I use comparative transcriptomics across the developmental types at the oocyte, embryo, and
single-blastomere level, allowing quantification of heterochronic, heterotopic, and heterometric gene
expression across different development types. This approach reveals 1) the genomic-level regulatory
architecture that alters development, 2) the role of maternal factors in initiating developmental and life-history
transitions, and 3) the specific genes involved in these changes. By integrating transcriptomics with population
genomic data, I will produce a complementary set of candidate genes involved in evolutionary-developmental
transitions, which I will validate in future studies. This proposal leverages the genetically tractable
developmental dimorphism in S. benedicti to answer fundamental evolutionary questions at multiple scales,
from the molecular to population level. The resulting genetic architecture and loci found within S. benedicti are
comparable across divergent organisms. This project will reveal the architecture and genetic mechanisms
through which maternal genetic effects shape developmental evolution and lead to novel
developmental programs."

changes of covariate effects, time-varying survival models have emerged as a powerful approach. To deal with
the size and complexity of data, with potential interactions among large number of variables, and interactions

estimating flexible hazard models with time-dependent covariates. Scalable and user friendly open source

Phosphosignaling provides the major conduit for bacterial adaptation. The two component systems (TCSs)
have long been viewed as the canonical phosphosignaling systems in bacteria, but increasingly, O-
phosphorylation mediated by Ser/Thr kinases is recognized as a relevant bacterial phosphosignaling
mechanism as well. We now show that in fact, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has an expansive,
distributed, and cooperative O-phosphorylation system of a size and complexity that is typically only associated
with eukaryotes. By using a comprehensive STPK loss- and gain-of-function mutant panel and quantitative
mass spectrometry, we show that >70% of Mtb proteins are phosphorylated on Ser/Thr/Tyr, identify thousands
of individual Ser/Thr kinase substrates, and show that the Ser/Thr kinases collectively control the expression of
~30% of Mtb genes. Here, we will test a new and extensive regulatory connection between the Ser/Thr kinases
and the His kinases of the TCSs and test the role of O-phosphorylation on the regulation of transcription
factors. As a result of our exhaustive analysis of Mtb phosphorylation, we also obtained the first evidence of
Arg phosphorylation in Mtb- the first bacterial Arg phosphoproteome outside of gram-positive bacteria. We will
identify the relevant phosphoenzymes and test the idea that pArg functions as a degradation tag for ClpP-
mediated proteolysis."

CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) induces complete remission in 70-90% of otherwise incurable patients. CAR-T
cell engagement with their target antigens induces expansion of activated CAR-T cells, producing cytokines
and other pro-inflammatory mediators. Unfortunately, in approximately 50% of patients this inflammatory
response also produces an Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS), a serious
neurotoxicity characterized by delirium, encephalopathy, dysphasia, and in severe cases, diffuse cerebral
edema that can be fatal. Additionally, ICANS increases the risk for long-term cognitive impairments; possible
consequences that have not been systematically studied. ICANS therefore remains a major challenge for the
wider adoption of CAR-T cell therapy, creating an urgent need to mitigate or prevent ICANS, to understand its
pathophysiology, and to predict its adverse long-term outcomes. We have compelling preliminary data
demonstrating that several pre-infusion neuroimaging markers predict ICANS with high accuracy. Building
upon these findings, we will develop a predictive algorithm in this proposal that will facilitate closer monitoring
of high-risk patients, support with preventive treatments, and risk-adapted dosing of CAR-T cells. Our
preliminary data also suggest that neuroimaging biomarkers serve as objective surrogates for clinical and
subclinical ICANS. These markers may guide future development of targeted anti-cytokine and small molecule
inhibitor-based interventions to inhibit or block neurotoxicity-specific pathways. Finally, preliminary data support
our hypothesis that ICANS-induced abnormalities in attentional networks of the brain cause long-term
neurocognitive impairments. Adverse outcomes are also seen in low grade neurotoxicity, suggesting a greater
need than previously anticipated for cognitive and behavioral interventions in CAR-T cell patients, rather than
only in patients with florid neurotoxicity. Expanding on our pilot study, we propose to conduct a prospective,
longitudinal cohort study of 80 consecutive patients who receive CAR-T cell therapy for B-ALL. We will collect
state-of-the-art (a) clinical assessments for ICANS and CRS, (b) multi-modal MRI to characterize brain
structure, function, and metabolism, (c) peripheral blood samples for immunophenotyping using CyTOF (mass
Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight) and to profile cytokines and biomarkers of blood brain barrier integrity, and (d)
neurocognitive testing to characterize cognitive changes. Longitudinal data will be collected at (1) a pre-
infusion baseline; and then post-infusion on (2) Day 10, when the ICANS risk is greatest, (3) Day 28, upon
ICANS resolution, and (4) month 12, for long-term outcomes. These data will identify, with unparalleled
inferential capacity, brain-based predictors and inflammatory mediators of ICANS, help develop brain MRI
guidelines for CAR-T cell therapy, and help recommend specific cognitive training and neuroprotective
strategies in patients with persistent brain deficits."
10840425,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Oral biofilm-related infections remain a persistent and costly clinical problem. Existing treatments are unable to
simultaneously kill and physically disrupt biofilms and require manual biofilm removal procedures that are
cumbersome with reduced efficacy in difficult to reach areas such as endodontic canal systems. Furthermore,
options for sample retrieval for diagnostics during clinical procedures are limited. Efficacious, automated
technologies capable of precisely targeting complex anatomical areas are needed to retrieve samples, kill and
remove biofilms, and deliver drugs on site. We propose a novel approach combining nanotechnology and
robotics to develop the first automated system for targeted disinfection, removal, and sampling of endodontic
biofilms. We have designed small-scale robots using catalytic nanoparticles as building blocks that display
tether-free controlled motion with multifunctionality. Our approach utilizes iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) with
dual catalytic-magnetic properties that (i) generate bactericidal and biofilm degrading reactive molecules in situ,
and (ii) remove the disrupted biofilm via magnetic-field driven robotic assemblies termed Catalytic Antibiofilm
Robots (CARs). Preliminary data demonstrate that CARs locally remove and collect biofilms with high precision
and efficacy in comparison to conventional treatment, including confined endodontic spaces. By tuning the
magneto-catalytic properties and control of the CARs systems, we will develop robotic device
prototypes that fit the oral cavity for simultaneous endodontic biofilm treatment, removal and sample
retrieval. We propose to further improve IONP-made robots coupled with a clinical electromagnetic controller
to develop two CARs-based oral biodevice platforms. (Aim 1) CAR1s, formed from aggregated IONP, will be
used for catalytic bacterial killing, biofilm treatment, and sample retrieval from root canals for diagnostic analysis.
We will identify key parameters for CAR1s improvement, assessing magnetic control, bioactivity and
visualization/tracking. CAR1s will be evaluated for targeting difficult-to-reach areas, such as C-shaped/curved
canals and isthmus, as well as treating and retrieving biofilms. We will characterize and improve CAR1 control
first using 3D-printed tooth replicas with diverse canal morphologies to improve movement and controllability,
followed by testing our system using ex vivo extracted tooth/typodont and pig jaw models. (Aim 2) CAR2s will
be fabricated by 3D micromolding functional polymers with embedded IONPs for biofilm disruption, retrieval,
and drug delivery at the apical region. We will optimize magnetic control and tracking, antibiofilm activity and
triggered cargo delivery, testing efficacy to remove and retrieve biofilms. We will assess bioactivity using mixed-
species biofilms and maneuverability to the apical region of the root canal recapitulated in 3D-printed teeth and
ex vivo models, while rigorously evaluating the robotic device in geometries suited to the oral cavity with
comparisons against conventional treatment. We expect the outcomes of the proposed studies will lead to the
first robotic biodevice system developed for automated biofilm theranostics for applications in dental medicine."
10840338,"The overarching goal of this grant is to develop an optimal viro-immunotherapy approach for the treatment of relapsed
refractory (R/R) T cell lymphoma (TCL). VSV-IFNβ-NIS is an oncolytic Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) engineered to
selectively infect and kill tumor cells, while sparing normal cells. In the recently completed first-in-human dose
escalation study utilizing a single intravenous (IV) infusion of VSV-IFNβ-NIS in patients with R/R multiple myeloma (MM)
and TCL, we reported that the virus can be safely administered up to the highest dose level tested (1.7e11 TCID50) with
no dose limiting toxicities. The most exciting and significant clinical activity was seen in patients with TCL who received
one dose of 1.7e11 TCID50 VSV-IFNβ-NIS as a single agent, with 5 clinical responses (2 CR and 3 PR) in 10 heavily
pretreated patients with multi-focal TCL. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) correlative analyses
suggest that responses are due to a combination of direct oncolytic tumor destruction and immune-mediated tumor
control. However, not all patients responded, and several patients had mixed tumor responses only. We recently
showed in preclinical models that addition of anti-CTLA-4 (αCTLA4) and anti-PD1 (αPD1) antibodies given prior to VSV-
IFNβ-NIS resulted in complete remission of established tumors in 100% of mice. Thus, the goal of this grant is to improve
the 50% response rate and durability of response (DOR) in patients with TCL by maximizing the potency of VSV-IFNβ-
NIS using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to amplify the antitumor activity of virotherapy-boosted tumor-reactive
CTL. In parallel, we seek to identify biomarkers and immune correlates differentiating responders from non-responders
in TCL through analysis of tumor biopsies and blood.
We thus have the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Determine the safety, PK/PD and efficacy of one IV of VSV-IFNβ-NIS in combination with immune
checkpoint antibodies for patients with R/R TCL. Hypothesis: Immune activation with αCTLA4 and αPD1 antibodies
followed by destruction of TCL with VSV virotherapy will maximize the boosting of antitumor cytotoxic T cells to bring
about long-term tumor control and remission.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the baseline tumor gene expression profile (antiviral and immune) and tumor mutation
burden (TMB) and evaluate their impact on clinical response. Hypothesis: A VSV permissive gene signature and high
TMB are positive contributing factors to the depth and durability of response.
Specific Aim 3. Determine the impact of VSV-IFNβ-NIS treatment with αCTLA4 and αPD1 immune boosting on the
kinetics, magnitude and specificity of antitumor CTL and Treg immune responses. Hypothesis: Timely addition of the
immune modulators with VSV virotherapy will result in enhanced frequency and duration of antigen reactive T cells.
Upon completion of this study, we will achieve a deeper understanding of parameters that drive responses in viro-
immunotherapy, and potentially derive a new treatment option worthy of further clinical development in patients with
R/R TCL. Results from this study will also provide the foundation for building more effective dosing for other cancer
indications."

Sex differences in stroke risk over the life course have been well-described, but we lack the knowledge of how
to use such differences to personalize stroke prevention and achieve a lower burden of stroke-related death
and disability. Our proposed work on the role of sex hormones in stroke risk will not only improve our
mechanistic knowledge of sex differences in stroke but will allow us to identify novel sex-specific targets to be
used for stroke prediction and prevention. Our overarching objective is to characterize a set of novel
phenotypic, genomic, epigenomic, and metabolomic sex hormone-related targets that are causally linked to
incident stroke using existing epidemiologic cohorts from a diverse population of women and men in the NHLBI
Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) consortium and to then integrate these variables into sex-
specific stroke risk scores for validation in an external cohort from ELSA-Brasil. Our team of cerebrovascular,
cardiovascular, and genetic epidemiologists along with stroke clinicians, biostatisticians, and sex and gender
science experts plan to use existing epidemiologic cohorts within the TOPMed omics consortium to identify the
mechanisms underlying sex hormones and stroke and to develop sex-specific prediction models. First, using a
targeted genomic approach based on our group’s prior work, we will elucidate the role of sex hormones
(including sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG) in the etiology of stroke risk. To achieve this, we will use
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genetic targets informed by our prior work to conduct sex-
disaggregated mendelian randomization analyses of the relationship between sex hormone levels and incident
stroke. Secondly, in an integrative omics analysis, we will elucidate sex hormone related biologic mechanistic
pathways for risk of incident stroke. Using existing TOPMed omics data, we will identify DNA methylation and
metabolomic profiles linking genetic determinants of hormone levels (individual SNPs and a hormone-based
genetic risk score) and physiologic variations in measured sex hormone levels to stroke risk in a series of sex-
disaggregated mediation analyses. Finally, we will develop novel, sex-specific stroke prediction models in
TOPMed incorporating sex hormone-based genetic risk scores, sex hormone levels, the presence of particular
methylation and metabolomic profiles, and the presence of established clinical, lifestyle, and reproductive risk
factors. We will then validate the models in a nested case cohort ancillary study of participants from ELSA-
Brasil. In summary, we propose to use existing prospective cohort studies with an integrative omics approach
to understand the relationship between endogenous sex hormones and stroke risk, a needed step toward the
use of biologic sex to achieve personalized stroke prevention. Finding evidence to support biologic
mechanisms underlying the relationship between sex hormones and stroke could help to establish causality,
improve risk prediction, and identify novel targets for improved, more personalized, stroke prevention and
improved brain health."
10809739,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tens of thousands of otherwise deadly cancers are cured worldwide each year by hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HCT), but unfortunately over one in ten patients will develop a viral lower respiratory tract
infection, with almost half of these patients succumbing to the infection. Without an intact immune system in the
first few months after transplant, these life-threatening infections offset the benefit derived from potentially life-
saving transplant. Over half of these infections are caused by four viruses: RSV, HMPV, HPIV3, and HPIV1,
none of which currently have any pharmacologic interventions for treatment or prevention after HCT. Although
adults are universally infected with these viruses in childhood, HCT recipients lose their immunity, making them
vulnerable to severe complications. Passive immunization with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represents a
strategy to reduce the risk of these infections. While several anti-RSV mAb candidates have progressed through
clinical trials, their use is limited to infants in whom RSV is responsible for virtually all cases of lung infection.
However, the clinical efficacy of these mAbs is expected to be substantially lower in HCT patients because other
important viruses like HMPV, HPIV3, and HPIV1 contribute significantly to disease. To fill this clinical gap for
HCT patients, we have discovered two cross-neutralizing mAbs: one that targets both RSV and HMPV and
another that targets both HPIV3 and HPIV1. Together, these mAbs could be combined to simultaneously protect
against the four viruses that cause most lung infections after HCT. To test efficacy, we will administer these
mAbs prophylactically and therapeutically to immunocompetent and immunocompromised animals. We will also
test the pharmacokinetics of these mAbs with modifications designed for increased half-life and lung
bioavailability, such that a single dose could bridge the entire period of vulnerability after transplant. Another
often neglected pitfall in bringing novel antibody therapies to the bedside is the potential for resistance. Recent
failed clinical trials of anti-RSV mAbs have shown that the emergence of escape variants can cripple clinical
development. How to predict success or failure during the preclinical phase before candidates progress into
clinical trials is an important question, and the answers could save massive amounts of resources, effort, and
time. To fill this knowledge gap, we have developed an innovative approach called deep mutational scanning
that provides a comprehensive picture of the viral mutational landscape, allowing an unprecedented preclinical
evaluation of resistance. Since the two cross-neutralizing mAbs described in this proposal bind to conserved
epitopes, these and similar mAbs may have a high barrier of resistance. To prepare for and counter resistance
by future viral variants, we will leverage predictions from our complete mutational maps to identify next-
generation mAbs, allowing us to stay a few steps ahead of viral evolution. These novel cross-neutralizing mAbs
and the innovative and rigorous approaches we have developed to vet them could provide a new standard of
care for HCT patients and inform the design and testing of other candidates with the greatest chance for success."

 Hypoperfusion is broadly reported as an important symptom of Alzheimer’s disease related dementia
(ADRD). Severity of cerebral blood flow (CBF) loss correlates with severity of cognitive deficit. However,
hypoperfusion is only one of the signs of microvascular dysfunction in ADRD and, in fact, may not be the most
sensitive or specific one. For example, in the recent NIH-funded MarkVCID Consortium study to identify the
most sensitive biomarkers of vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), CBF was
not selected as a candidate biomarker kit (despite proposed), whereas an index of vasodilatory function,
referred to as cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), was selected. In AD, despite the widely reported observations
that there is hypoperfusion in posterior cingulate cortex and temporoparietal regions, some proposed this to be
an indirect effect attributed to metabolic abnormalities via metabolism-vascular coupling. Therefore, to
systematically understand the mechanism of hypoperfusion in ADRD, one needs to look beyond perfusion to
examine a suite of related vascular and metabolic parameters in the brain.
 Therefore, the central goal of this application is to conduct a multi-parametric study to fully characterize the
relationship between hypoperfusion and related vascular and metabolic underpinnings, separately in AD and
small vessel disease (SVD) mice, as they represent two leading causes of dementia and most prominently
linked to hypoperfusion. The proposed study in mouse models will parallel our ongoing efforts in human
participants, making this work having a strong translational relevance. Using novel MRI techniques, we will
measure CBF, cerebrovascular reactivity, oxygen extraction fraction, cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, and
BBB permeability concomitantly, and compare them to behavior (e.g. novel object recognition) and histology
(e.g. smooth muscle cell density, tight-junction protein density) results (Aim 1). These multiple parameters will
be integrated into a mechanistic model, which is fully testable based on the experimental measures proposed.
The PI, an early stage investigator, is uniquely positioned to carry out this work because he has pioneered
several of these MRI techniques in mice over the past few years. The non-invasive nature of these techniques
(e.g. does not require skull thinning or contrast agents) also make them ideally suited for longitudinal studies
(Aim 2), which will allow the characterization of the temporal relationship between hypoperfusion (and related
vascular/metabolic parameters) and behavior outcomes. Two novel mouse models of Tau4RΔK-AP (replicating
tauopathy and amyloidosis of AD) and CADASIL (replicating vascular pathology of SVD) will be utilized, based
on the recent discovery of our collaborators. Taking together, we are in a unique position to make meaning
contributions to the understanding of hypoperfusion in ADRD."

Disorders of the esophagus are significant health problems in the U.S. and throughout the world, and
esophageal cancer, of which more than 80% is esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC), is the 6th most
common cause of cancer death worldwide. Exposure of esophageal squamous epithelial cells (keratinocytes)
to injurious agents such as cigarette smoke and alcohol predisposes to ESCC, and yet malignant
transformation of a single esophageal keratinocyte even in response to such stressors is rare. Thus, important
cytoprotective mechanisms must exist in normal esophageal keratinocytes to respond to these insults and
prevent malignant transformation of these cells. To date, these mechanisms are not well understood. Here,
we propose to delineate important cytoprotective pathways in esophageal keratinocytes, focusing on the key
transcriptional regulator Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) and the tumor suppressor p53 in the response to
physiologic stress. In normal epithelia, KLF5 functions to promote proliferation and migration and to inhibit
inflammation, and in new preliminary data, we define critical functions for KLF5 and wild-type p53 in the cellular
responses to exogenous stress in non-transformed esophageal keratinocytes and demonstrate that mutant
p53 modulates genome-wide binding of KLF5, thereby altering the targets and pathways governed by KLF5 in
this context. Our overarching hypothesis is that KLF5 and p53 are a molecular rheostat, coordinately
regulating esophageal squamous epithelial responses to exogenous stressors, and that disruption of this
regulation underlies defective cell repair and ESCC. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following
interrelated Specific Aims: 1. We will define KLF5-p53 targets and function in normal keratinocytes with
exogenous stress; 2. We will determine mutant p53 alterations of genome-wide KLF5 binding in homeostasis
and stress; 3. We will delineate the functions of KLF5 and p53 in esophageal mucosal injury resulting from
smoking and alcohol. Overall, the proposed studies provide a framework to understand the mechanisms by
which normal esophageal keratinocytes respond to environmental stresses and the perturbations of these
responses that underlie malignant transformation and progression in the squamous esophagus."

Spinal cord interneurons (INs) play indispensable roles in CNS circuit connectivity and function. Importantly,
spinal IN populations are centrally involved in plasticity mechanisms responsible for mediating the limited degree
of functional recovery that can occur spontaneously after spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, critical questions
that need to be addressed are: Can therapeutic interventions further recruit these spinal cord INs into remodelled
circuits to robustly restore lost function following SCI? If so, by which modes of circuit plasticity can this spinal
cord IN recruitment occur? To address this highly important topic in this R01 Renewal application, we aim to
examine whether therapeutically stimulating axon regeneration can promote respiratory circuit plasticity via the
formation of pre-phrenic IN (PP-IN) relay circuits to drive recovery of diaphragm function after cervical SCI.
 A majority of SCI cases occur in the cervical spinal cord, resulting in persistent diaphragmatic respiratory
dysfunction that is associated with mortality, dependence on mechanical ventilation, a host of morbidities such
as respiratory infections, and greatly reduced quality of life. Diaphragm is directly controlled by phrenic motor
neurons (PhMNs) located at cervical spinal cord levels C3, C4 and C5. PhMNs are monosynaptically activated
by supraspinal brainstem neurons located in rostral Ventral Respiratory Group (rVRG). Cervical SCI results in
the axotomy of descending rVRG fibers, denervation and silencing of spared PhMNs, and diaphragm paralysis.
 We have demonstrated that systemic administration of a blood brain barrier-permeable PTEN antagonist
peptide (PAP) can regenerate rVRG axons after cervical SCI, resulting in significant restoration of diaphragm
function. Excitingly, our findings suggest that PAP-induced rVRG axon regeneration is promoting a substantial
portion this diaphragm recovery via formation of polysynaptic PP-IN relay circuitry. Specifically, we hypothesize
that intersegmental PP-INs can be recruited to relay bulbospinal input from regenerating rVRG axons to PhMNs.
 In Aim 1 studies, we will determine whether selectively silencing C3-to-C5 projecting intersegmental PP-
INs impacts recovery of diaphragm function stimulated by PAP-induced rVRG axon regeneration after C2
hemisection SCI. To do so, we will use an innovative dual-viral vector chemogenetic silencing approach, coupled
with monosynaptic and polysynaptic retrograde and anterograde rVRG / PP-IN / PhMN circuit tracing. In Aim 2,
we will determine whether therapeutically stimulating regeneration of C1-to-C5 projecting PP-IN axons across
a SCI lesion promotes diaphragm recovery after C2 hemisection, again using a chemogenetic silencing strategy.
In Aim 3, we will extend this work to the more clinically-associated cervical contusion SCI model to begin to
assess the translational potential of targeting intersegmental PP-IN plasticity to promote respiratory recovery.
 In this innovative and highly-significant project, we will: (1) determine whether spinal cord IN populations
can be beneficially recruited into new neural circuits in response to therapeutic stimulation of axon regeneration;
and (2) uncover PP-IN plasticity mechanisms capable of promoting respiratory recovery following cervical SCI."
10817085,"Much of the basic research on cardiac biology has been focused on cardiomyocytes (CMs), aiming to unravel
the basic principles underlying cardiac physiology and pathophysiology for future development of therapeutic
interventions to treat cardiac diseases. Besides CMs, the heart contains many other cell types including
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and a wide variety of immune cells. During heart development and homeostasis,
non-myocytes (nonCMs) have been increasingly recognized to play active roles in regulating various CM
behaviors. Yet a lack of detailed information on the cellular identities and cell states of the nonCMs associated
development and homeostasis is a major hurdle to precisely delineating the biological events in heart
development and homeostasis. In our recently published study, we delineated nonCMs cellular and
transcriptomic dynamics during cardiac regeneration. Through scRNA-seq, we identified major nonCM cell types,
including multiple macrophage (MC), FB and EC subpopulations with unique tempo-spatial distribution.
Prticularly, we found that MC exists in multiple definable states that exhibit dynamic functional changes from
acute inflammatory response to inflammation resolution. Interestingly, perturbing MC function resulted in
defective cardiac regeneration. Combining Topologizer and RNA velocity analyses, we uncovered dynamic
transition between MC functional states and identified factors involved in mRNA processing and transcriptional
regulation associated with the transition. However, whether and how nonCMs interact at the subpopulation level,
and MC dynamic functional change affects nonCMs interactions and hence heart regeneration remains largely
unexplored. In this research proposal, we hypothesize that heart regeneration is a highly orchestrated process
involving temporally regulated MC function executed by the distinct subtypes and their interactions with other
nonCM cell types. To test this hypothesis, we aim to 1) define the role of the inflammatory MCs (iMCs) subtype
in nonCM interaction and heart regeneration, 2) delineate the role of the immune surveillance MC (isMCs)
subtype in nonCM interaction and heart regeneration, and 3) study the molecular mechanism governing
transition of MC functional states."
10804665,"Title: Targeting of IL-1 Signaling in Myelofibrosis
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and
myelofibrosis (MF) are a group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell derived myeloid malignancies characterized
by overproduction of myeloid lineage cells. MF is the deadliest among MPNs. The median survival of patients
with MF is ~5 years. The oncogenic JAK2V617F mutation was found in ~95% cases of PV and ~50-60% cases
of ET and MF. Mutations in the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL) and calreticulin (CALR) were also detected in
MF. Currently approved JAK inhibitors, Ruxolitinib and Fedratinib, can alleviate constitutional symptoms but
they do not offer significant improvement of bone marrow fibrosis. Therefore, there is an unmet need to identify
new therapeutic targets and develop novel therapies for MF. Chronic inflammation is frequently associated with
MPN/MF. Expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1), a master regulator of inflammation, is found elevated in MPN/MF
patients as well as in Jak2V617F knock-in mice. However, the contribution of IL-1 signaling in the
pathogenesis of MPN/MF has remained elusive. In preliminary studies, we have found that genetic deletion of
IL-1R1 normalizes peripheral blood counts, reduces splenomegaly and significantly inhibits bone marrow
fibrosis in a Jak2V617F knock-in mouse model of MF. So, we hypothesize that IL-1 signaling may play an
important role in the pathogenesis of MF and targeting of IL-1 signaling might be useful for treatment of MF. In
this proposal, we will further investigate the contribution of IL-1 signaling in the pathogenesis of MF and test
the efficacy of pharmacologic inhibition of IL-1 signaling in pre-clinical models of myelofibrosis. We will also
determine the mechanism by which inhibition of IL-1 signaling prevents the progression of MPN/MF. Results
from this study may lead to new therapeutic approach for treatment of myelofibrosis."

Treatment options for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have remained largely unchanged for 3 decades,
with no new FDA-approved treatments for 20 years, and no targeted therapies. We recently performed a screen
for targets of an arginine methyltransferase called CARM1 and identified the NFI family of transcription factors
as substrates for this PRMT. Importantly, NFIB harbors both oncogenic and metastatic promoting activities in
the context of SCLC development. We confirmed that CARM1 functions as a transcriptional coactivator for NFIB.
Based on these finding, we hypothesize that CARM1 methylation of NFIB is critical for its tumor-promoting
functions. To further support this premise, we have generated a Nfib knockin mouse that harbors a R-to-K
mutation in the CARM1 methylation site. When this mouse is crossed onto a SCLC genetically engineered mouse
model (GEMM) the life expectancy of these mice is lengthened by a third (from 200 to 300 days), which is almost
identical to the impact of Carm1-loss in the same GEMM. These finding raise the possibility of targeting SCLC
with CARM1 small molecule inhibitors. We have also identified an effector molecule (TRIM29) for the CARM1
methylation site on NFIB. In this proposal we plan to: (1) perform a deep mechanistic analysis of this newly
discovered CARM1/NFIB/TRIM29 signaling axis, and (2) investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting this
axis using a battery of pre-clinical mouse models."
10828411,"We have been evaluating magnetic stimulation from tiny, implantable coils (referred to as microcoils) for use in
a next-generation cochlear implant (CI). Existing CIs enable speech discrimination, but their effectiveness
decreases when background noise levels are high, and most users cannot appreciate music. While a number
of factors are thought to contribute to these limitations, it is generally agreed that complex auditory signals,
such as those arising from speech in the presence of background noise, or music, require more independent
spectral channels than are created by existing, electrode-based CIs. Increasing the number of channels has
proven challenging however, as the highly conductive solution surrounding implants (perilymph) expands the
spread of activation from each electrode so that fields from neighboring electrodes overlap and channels are
no longer independent. The spread of fields is worsened because the targets of stimulation (spiral ganglion
neurons) are within one of the bony cavities of the cochlea and thus higher stimulus levels are required for
activation which lead to increased current spread. Microcoils may be an attractive alternative to electrodes
because the physics governing the spread of induced fields (Maxwell’s equations) suggests narrower
confinement of activation. Further, the high permeability of biological tissues to magnetic fields allows
stimulation to pass readily through the bony wall, without the need for increased stimulation levels (and the
resulting spread of activation). Consistent with this, stimulation from micro-coils implanted in the cochleae of
both mice (Lee et al., 2022) and guinea pig (present proposal) results in narrow channels of activation in the
inferior colliculus, i.e., better approximating the normal physiological signal, and smaller than those from
electrodes. The ability to create narrow spectral channels suggests a larger number of independent channels
are possible with microcoils and thus the potential exists for improved rehabilitation of hearing. Our goal here is
to further evaluate the potential of microcoils for use in CIs. The Aims focus on (1) electrophysiological
evaluation of implanted microcoils, (2) evaluation of the interactions between neighboring channels on the
multi-coil array, (3) chronic testing of coil-based implants, and (4) development of a computer model to help
understand the mechanism(s) of activation. All physiological testing will take place in guinea pigs, a well-
established animal model for evaluation of CI performance; our team has previous experience with this animal
and new preliminary results validate the overall viability of our device and the approach. Our multi-disciplinary
team has strong expertise in microcoil design and development, magnetic stimulation, computer modeling,
cochlear implants and auditory physiology. Almost all of the team is located at Mass. General Hospital or next
door at Mass. Eye and Ear; the results presented here are the result of a 2+ year collaboration between team

10811725,"Summary
The actin cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic system consisting of hundreds of proteins. Cells use
the actin cytoskeleton to move, divide, transport organelles and exchange materials with the
environment. Many human diseases result from malfunctioning of actin cytoskeletal
components. There is therefore intense interest in understanding molecular mechanisms that
control actin cytoskeletal processes, which has both fundamental importance and the potential
to accelerate the development of targeted therapies to treat human diseases. Among actin
cytoskeletal components, none is more important than Arp2/3 complex, a 7-subunit actin
filament nucleation and branching system conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to human. This
grant addresses important gaps of knowledge of the mechanisms of Arp2/3 complex
activation, inhibition, branch stabilization, and branch destabilization. Published work,
extensive preliminary studies presented in the application, and new advances in the laboratory
such as the implementation of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to the Arp2/3 complex
system, and innovative protein expression methods and biochemical assays provide the
scientific and technical premises supporting the research plans. The specific aims focus on three
major areas: 1) understand the molecular determinants of human Arp2/3 complex branch
stability and mechanosensation using a microfluidics-TIRF microscopy assay, 2) determine the
structural-functional mechanism of branch stabilization by cortactin using biochemical methods
and cryo-EM, and 3) uncover whether one of the members of the coronin family acts as an
Arp2/3 complex inhibitor, a branch stabilizer, or a branch destabilizer using biochemical
approaches and cryo-EM"
10840340,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infections with enteric pathogens such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, or Yersinia are leading causes
of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Although in most individuals the infection resolves, approximately 5% of
patients subsequently develop a painful chronic inflammatory condition known as Reactive Arthritis (ReA). How
Salmonella infections trigger ReA is not well understood. Using Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm)
as a model organism, we discovered that a Salmonella protein, curli, is a dominant instigator of inflammation
following Salmonella infection. Curli is a secreted protein and major component of the STm biofilm in the
gastrointestinal tract. Curli fibrils bind extruded bacterial DNA within the biofilm. It is these curli:DNA complexes,
rather than curli alone, that are potent triggers of type I interferon, IL-17, and anti-double stranded DNA
autoantibody production, leading to ReA. Unknown, however, is why curli:DNA complexes are so inflammatory.
We report in this proposal the remarkable discovery that the DNA present within curli:DNA complexes is not
solely B-DNA, the classic right-handed (Watson-Crick) double-helix, but includes copious amounts of left-handed
Z-DNA as well. Z-form nucleic acids, such as Z-DNA and Z-RNA, were thought not to readily occur in nature,
until we showed last year that Z-RNA is indeed produced during virus infections and is a ligand for the
necroptosis-activating host sensor protein ZBP1. Our preliminary results now show that the Z-DNA within
curli:DNA complexes activates ZBP1 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and fibroblasts, resulting in RIPK3-
dependent necroptosis of these cells. These findings allow us to put forward the hypothesis that Z-DNA within
curli:DNA fibrils in Salmonella biofilms activates ZBP1 to instigate RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in intestinal
epithelial cells (IECs) and other cell types. Necroptosis, in turn, causes cell loss and disrupts gut barrier integrity,
releasing inflammatory mediators that eventually result in autoimmunity and ReA. As necroptosis is a highly
inflammatory mode of cell death, these findings, at long last, supply a plausible mechanism for why curli:DNA
complexes are hyperinflammatory, and, therefore, for how Salmonella triggers ReA. They also identify Z-DNA
as a new PAMP, implicate ZBP1 – until now considered an antiviral protein – as a sensor of bacterial infections,
and position RIPK3 inhibitors as unanticipated new therapeutics for the treatment of ReA. In aim 1, we will
determine how Z-DNA forms within curli:DNA complexes, and how Z-DNA activates ZBP1. In aim 2, we will
identify the ZBP1-driven immune pathways that promote curli:DNA induced inflammation and ReA, and
determine the cell types in which ZBP1 signaling is important for pathogenesis. In aim 3, we will evaluate whether
necroptosis blockade with RIPK3 kinase inhibitors will have preventive or therapeutic benefit in ReA. A
successful outcome to these studies will outline an entirely new mechanism of Salmonella-triggered
inflammation. They also stand to open up exciting new therapeutic avenues for Salmonella-induced ReA, with
potentially game-changing ramifications for this currently incurable disease."
10809663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medical care in the United States is increasingly delivered in health systems—which the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality has defined as organizations with at least one hospital and one physician group
providing comprehensive care that operate through common ownership or joint management. In the past
decade, health system acquisition of physician practices has increased markedly; more than half of U.S.
physicians are now affiliated with one of 637 health systems. Prior research has found that vertical integration
can lead to higher commercial health care prices, but has uncertain effects on quality, spending, and utilization
for Medicare beneficiaries. Little is known about how health system expansion influences care for medically
complex Medicare patients, a distinct population that has high health needs and frequent interactions with the
medical system. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to determine whether the growth of health
systems improves care for medically complex patients and what health system strategies and characteristics
contribute to their success or failure in doing so. The overall objective of this project is to provide health care
leaders and policymakers with an understanding of whether and how health systems change the delivery and
quality of care for medically complex Medicare beneficiaries, with a focus on patients in acquired primary care
practices. The central hypotheses are that, on average, health system acquisition of practices improves care
for medically complex patients, but that improvement varies across health systems. These hypotheses will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) determine the impact of health system acquisition of primary care
practices on utilization, spending, and quality for medically complex patients (overall and for three
subpopulations); (2) examine variation by health system in spending and quality changes for medically
complex patients at acquired practices, and identify characteristics of systems that most improve their care;
and (3) understand how the experiences of physicians and the efforts of health system leaders differ at
systems that improve care for medically complex patients at acquired practices from those that do not. This
project will use Medicare claims data and qualitative data collected by the researchers. Methodologically, it will
employ rigorous quasi-experimental approaches including difference-in-differences analyses, as well as in-
depth, semi-structured interviews with health system leaders and practicing physicians. The proposed research
is innovative, in the applicants' opinion, because it fills critical gaps about whether, which, and how health
system acquisitions improve care for medically complex patients. It will also build on AHRQ's prior investment
in developing a Compendium of U.S. Health Systems, and make an expanded database publicly available for
other researchers to use. The project is significant because it will provide rigorous evidence on the impact of
vertical integration across a range of quality, utilization, and spending outcomes and will identify strategies that
may improve the design of health systems to create a higher value medical system."
10833172,"The ability of adipose tissue to efficiently store and release lipid is critical for mammals to maintain metabolic
health. In conditions when triglyceride storage by adipocytes is impaired lipid accumulates ectopically in non-
adipocytes and is associated with common systemic disorders including type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, susceptibility to infections, atherosclerosis, dementia and autoimmune disorders. Although the
pathways that regulate systemic release of lipids via lipolysis and the uptake of fatty acids and carbohydrates for
lipogenesis have long been known and are well studied, our understanding of local lipid homeostasis in fat is
largely unexplored. Studies originally funded by the grant found that macrophages and other immune cells
accumulate in adipose tissue in response to changes in metabolic state and that the adipose tissue macrophages
have a unique phenotype and ability to handle and metabolism lipid. In studying the source of lipid in adipose
tissue macrophages, we discovered a lipase-independent pathway of lipid release by adipocytes, in which acyl-
glycerides are incorporated into extracellular vesicles (AdExos) and released at a high rate that correlates with
adipose tissue macrophage content and lipolysis. During the current funding cycle we published these findings
and described basic aspects of AdExos biology including their rate of release by adipocytes and regulation by
adiposity, uptake by ATMs via macropinocytosis, ability to induce chemotaxis in bone marrow derived
macrophages and to activate a program of lipid metabolism typical of authentic ATMs. From these findings we
hypothesize AdExos are the key interface between the metabolic and immune systems in fat and a central
component of lipid homeostasis in adipose tissue. In the current proposal, we set out to determine whether
AdExos regulate the recruitment, differentiation and proliferation of monocyte-derived and resident ATMs, test
whether the differential response to AdExo of monocyte derived and resident ATMs account for differences in
inflammatory and trophic phenotypes, determine whether a lipolysis per se drives AdExo production and test if
ATM hydrolysis of lipids in AdExos contribute to a lipid cycle in adipose tissue."

Synaptic transmission and plasticity are fundamental to neuronal functions, and dysregulations of synaptic
protein expression are direct causes of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Over one hundred de
novo loss-of-function mutations in SYNGAP1 have been unambiguously associated with autism spectral
disorders and intellectual disability. Recent success in splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) suggests that
redirecting splicing through genetic and SSO-mediated ablations is a promising approach to rescue
haploinsufficiency. We have identified an alternative splicing event in SYNGAP1 that leads to nonsense-
mediated mRNA decay (NMD) during mouse and human development. To determine whether the SYNGAP1
NMD exon is a viable therapeutic target, we investigate the regulatory mechanism and its functions using genetic
approaches, and determine whether genetic deletion and SSO suppression of the SYNGAP1 NMD exon can
rescue heterozygous knockout phenotypes in mouse mutants and patient-iPSC-derived neurons. Upon
completion, this project will provide genetic insights into the physiological functions of this SYNGAP1 NMD exon
and generate critical preclinical reagents to restore SYNGAP1 protein expression from haploinsufficiency."
10823263,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The systematic sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed a high prevalence of mutations in genes encoding
chromatin regulatory proteins. Of these aberrations, mutations in genes encoding subunits of SWI/SNF (BAF)
chromatin-remodeling complexes are the most frequent, collectively occurring in over 20% of all cancers.
Whereas most genes that are mutated at such high frequencies in cancer have been studied for many decades,
recognition of a prominent role for SWI/SNF mutations is much more recent. The first link between SWI/SNF and
cancer came when the gene encoding the SMARCB1 subunit was found to be biallelically inactivated in nearly
all cases of the highly aggressive and lethal cancer of early childhood termed malignant rhabdoid tumor (RT).
Notably, these RT cancers are genomically stable and diploid, rendering them a highly useful model in which to
study the effects of SWI/SNF disruption. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the function of SWI/SNF
complexes, to determine how their loss leads to oncogenesis, and to translate this understanding into novel
highly effective therapies. Our group established SMARCB1 to be a bona fide and potent tumor suppressor and
later made high-impact discoveries that help define mechanisms by which SWI/SNF mutations lead to
dysregulated cell proliferation. Our findings to date suggest a model whereby SWI/SNF-facilitated control of
transcription underlies cellular fate specification, with disruption of this control being the basis for cancer
formation. We hypothesized that loss of SMARCB1, while driving cancer growth, also creates unique
vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, we undertook a rigorous screen involving 21 RT cell lines
compared to 800 other cancer cell lines. From this screen, we identified and subsequently validated two novel
genes as being required specifically and potently for RT cell survival. Using multiple approaches and tools, we
have validated both genes as specifically essential in RT cells. Our subsequent preliminary data reveal that both
genes have unanticipated novel roles in chromatin regulation: both regulate active chromatin and specifically
facilitate acetylation of lysine residues on histone H3 that facilitate transcription of target genes. We now
hypothesize that these genes cooperate with SWI/SNF complexes, and that elucidation of their function will
provide novel insights into chromatin-mediated regulation of transcription, mechanisms by which mutation of
SWI/SNF subunits drive cancer, and vulnerabilities created by SWI/SNF mutations. Additionally, both genes
bring the opportunity for therapeutic targeting. In the proposed work, we will define the mechanistic relationship
between these genes and SWI/SNF and determine the mechanism underlying the specific vulnerabilities in RT.
Taken together, these efforts have potential for substantial impact by broadening understanding of the roles of
chromatin regulators in normal cells and in transformation and by identifying highly specific new therapeutic
targets for these lethal childhood cancers."

Brain activities involve neurons generating fast-propagating signals to encode and relay information within
dynamic neural networks. Neuroscientists aspire to obtain access to such networks in unconstrained animal
models (e.g., rodents) with high spatiotemporal resolution, which will shed light on the fundamental working
mechanisms of the brain. Optical imaging, particularly multiphoton microscopy, has played a significant role in
this endeavor. The past decade has seen impressive progresses, from head-restrained benchtop microscopy
with virtual navigation to large FOV microscopy for neuron population imaging, three-photon microscopy for deep
brain imaging, and two-photon (2P) miniscopy for in vivo imaging in freely-walking (but limited rotation) mice.
Despite these exciting technological advances, tools for simultaneous, large-scale, and high-resolution
imaging over multiple brain regions in freely-behaving rodents are still lacking. Successful development of
such tools can accelerate the process of uncovering general principles of neural networks in a working brain
under nearly natural conditions. The free-moving style for imaging would minimize the differences between
experimentally controlled actions and natural spontaneous behaviors, thus allowing for precise examination of
neural network functions. The capability of simultaneous imaging over two interconnected neural populations
would provide a comprehensive and precise timeline of the neural circuit dynamics associated with various
behaviors at both cellular and population levels.
Our proposed research is motivated by the need for such imaging tools with the above-mentioned features. The
main objective is to develop a 3D-scanning, ultrathin and light 2P fiberscope technology for enabling high-
resolution, simultaneous imaging of dynamic neural activities over a large FOV at two brain regions in freely-
moving rodents. To achieve our objective, we propose the following aims:
(1) To develop a fast scanning 2P fiberscope of a large FOV (Ø500 um) using a cascaded magnification
strategy while maintaining a compact probe size (Ø2.5 mm). The larger FOV will be achieved by using an
innovative micro-optics design. In addition, a modular scanner head design will be implemented in the 2P
fiberscope to improve the probe robustness for in vivo imaging at a high scanning frequency (e.g., ~2.8 kHz);
(2) To develop a miniature (Ø2mm) tunable lens that can be integrated into our 2D scanning fiberscope
for enabling depth (focus) scanning/selection over 150 um. Focus scanning allows for convenient selection
of a proper layer or population of neurons. The tunable lens can create a curved refractive index profile when
applied with a low-voltage (<10 V, safe) electrical drive. Compared with other tunable lenses, the tunable lens
will be extremely compact and light, critical for imaging freely-moving rodents. A fiberscope integrated with a
tunable lens will be developed and tested using phantoms, fluorescent tissue slides, and a mouse model in vivo.
(3) To develop a dual-probe system, enabling simultaneous 2P imaging of two brain regions in freely-
walking/rotating mice. The ultracompact size and lightweight of the fiberscope permit two fiberscopes to be
mounted a mouse head, allowing for simultaneous imaging of two brain regions (cortex or deep brain). A novel,
proactive, dual-probe optoelectrical commutator (dpOEC) will be developed for the first time to sense and
compensate the torque built up in the fiberscopes, allowing the mouse to walk/rotate freely during imaging;
(4) To assess the feasibility of the dual-probe 2P technology for exploring neural network dynamics in
two different brain regions simultaneously during social decision making. Social behavior involves
sensory, cognitive, and motor functions and thus depends on the interactions of many neurons, but until now no
technology is available to record from a large population of neurons with subcellular resolution over multiple
interconnected regions in freely-behaving mice. Here we choose to study the dynamic neural connectivity
between the primary motor cortex (M1) and a critical sensory information routing node, periaqueductal gray
(PAG). Both areas are critically involved in social behavior, but how these interconnected regions synergize to
process information remains almost completely unknown. In addition to testing the performance of the 2P
fiberscopy technology, this aim could also shed light on how social preference is encoded. As a control, we will
monitor these regions during a locomotion (but nonsocial) activity (Rotarod running), for which the information
on M1 that is independent of PAG is already available.
In summary, successful completion of the proposed study will establish a new two-photon fiberscope imaging
platform for the neuroscience community to enable simultaneous high-resolution imaging of neural network
dynamics of different cell types over different brain regions in freely-behaving rodents. In addition, focus/depth
scanning will be made possible. The fiberscope can be easily attached to and detached from the mouse head,
permitting repeated use. Although beyond the scope of current proposal, the technology can also have many
translational applications, including internal luminal organ imaging for diagnosis or guidance of intervention."

IgA Nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis and an important cause of kidney
failure worldwide. The affected individuals develop characteristic IgA1-containing antibody complexes that
deposit in the kidney, producing progressive renal injury. The disease is associated with a specific pathogenic
defect in the O-glycosylation of IgA1 that promotes formation of immune complexes. Similar to other immune-
mediated disorders, IgA nephropathy has a complex genetic architecture. In the prior funding period, we
completed a GWAS for IgA nephropathy (10,146 cases and 28,751 controls) and we identified 30 genome-
wide significant risk loci, explaining 11% of disease risk. We observed clear convergence of biological
candidate genes on a common set of cytokine ligand-receptor pairs involved in mucosal IgA responses,
including on targets of existing drugs. In a GWAS of 2,170 cases and 5,928 controls, we also defined novel
genome-wide significant loci for IgA vasculitis, a related childhood condition with kidney complications. We
further enhanced these efforts by studies of serum IgA (GWAS in 41,263 individuals) and galactose-deficient-
IgA1 levels (GWAS in 10,193 individuals). Mendelian randomization provided strong genetic support for the
causal role of these endophenotypes. The overall goal of this proposal is to leverage these findings to identify
causal genes underlying shared genetic susceptibility between these traits. In Aim 1, we plan to conduct multi-
phenotype mapping across all four traits to better define shared and trait-specific loci. Multiome single nuclei
sequencing will be used to generate high resolution regulatory maps of IgA+ cells for fine-mapping and
prioritization of candidate causal genes. In Aim 2, we will study the role of the prioritized genes in health and
disease by leveraging Pakistani Genomic Resource, the largest cohort of human knockouts (KOs), with
homozygous KOs for >5000 genes and heterozygous KOs for >18,000 genes. We will perform call-back
studies in selected consanguineous families to identify carriers of loss-of-function and gain-of-function variants
in the genes of interest, followed by clinical and detailed immunophenotyping studies. These efforts will be
complemented by targeted gene perturbation experiments in IgA1-producing cells. In Aim 3, we will perform
phenome-wide association studies, and correlate our new genetic findings with clinical features. Based on
these findings, we will formulate and validate an integrated genomic risk score for kidney disease progression
in two large prospective cohorts of IgA nephropathy and IgA vasculitis with nephritis. These studies are
expected to refine our proposed disease pathogenesis model, define new therapeutic targets, and accelerate
clinical translation of our genetic findings."

Under the PAR-21-174 Funding Opportunity, the NJDA will be pursuing Path B. The NJDA will continue
its work on implementation of the FSMA Produce Safety Rule by building on progress achieved during
the previous funding opportunity. The goals of the funding opportunity and the NJDA in general remain
the same – promoting a proactive food safety culture, educating the grower population, and enforcing
the Produce Safety Rule in an effort to keep people safe.
Throughout the funding opportunity, the NJDA will focus it’s efforts verifying our covered farm
inventory – ensuring that all 3 tiers of farms are completely verified by the end of the grant. To do this,
we will use existing departmental lists – as in the past – as well as local tax records to find farms that
may not be on our radar. In addition, education of all covered farms is a priority. We will be working
with our sub awardee Rutgers University to educate new farms discovered through our inventory
verification efforts and offer continuing education and resources to farms who need it through our new
produce safety website. Lastly, we will continue the progress made on the regulatory side – all covered
farms will undergo an initial Produce Safety Rule inspection by the end of the grant. To help achieve this,
we have switched to an online database, USA Plants, to ensure secure documentation of inspections and
farm information.
The NJDA believes these are attainable goals with the help of the funding opportunity. During the next 5
years, the NJDA can further grow it’s produce safety program and form a multi-state produce safety
network with the overall mission of a proactive food safety program that keeps everyone safe."

ASN is the largest nephrology society in the world with more than 21,000 members and a longstanding
commitment to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. Within kidney disease there is a great need for equity in
dialysis access (DA). We plan to significantly expand our DEI footprint in this area through the Dialysis Access-
Justice, Equity, Diversity and Inclusion program (DA-JEDI) by recruiting a cohort of fellows/early-career faculty
who identify as underrepresented in medicine (URM). These individuals would then be exposed to a unique
blend of mentorship, leadership, and skill development courses, with a strong DA focus, that will set them on a
pathway to become champions for equitable, patient-centered DA care, and also future leaders in ASN and the
broader dialysis access and kidney community. We will achieve these goals through four specific aims.
In Specific Aim 1 we will recruit a cohort of participants who identify as URM into DA-JEDI. In Specific Aim 2 we
will provide individualized didactic and experiential skills training through ASN initiatives, through the participants
CTSA, or though DA-JEDI’s own CTSA links. This will include an annual DA-JEDI Symposium. In Specific Aim
3, we will foster unique multi-faceted mentorship opportunities, and finally in Specific Aim 4 we will focus on the
creation of an alumni network, promote networking opportunities and develop an interactive evaluation process
with a strong feedback loop.
Putting it all together, we strongly believe that growing our DA-JEDI participants into future leaders for ASN, the
kidney community, and the DA community, will allow us to better serve our patients, who deserve justice, equity,
diversity, and inclusion in both DA and kidney care."

Despite the great need for oral healthcare access, many older adults rely on traditional fee -for-service (FFS)
Medicare, which does not provide routine dental benefits. The need for oral healthcare services is especially
critical for older adults who are racial/ethnic minorities and those who are economically-disadvantaged, as
these groups display significantly poorer oral health than their counterparts. Medicare Advantage (MA) health
plans are available to U.S. seniors as an alternative to FFS Medicare health plans. MA plans offer access to
more comprehensive dental benefits than traditional FFS Medicare, and individuals from underserved
backgrounds are enrolling in MA at higher rates than other demographics. Therefore, MA coverage could help
facilitate oral health equity among the Medicare-eligible older adult population. Our analyses in this timely,
exploratory study will help to determine if there is in fact equity in access to and utilization of oral health
services among all demographics of MA enrollees. We will conduct the following aims: Aim 1. Estimate
whether traditionally underserved groups, compared to their counterparts, are less likely to have
dental coverage in their Medicare Advantage (MA) plans; are less likely to use dental services if
covered; and are more likely to receive emergency dental care and receive dental care in a non-dental
setting if using covered dental services; Aim 2. Estimate disparities in MA dental coverage, MA
covered dental use conditional on MA dental coverage, and emergency dental care and type of dental
setting conditional on MA covered dental use after controlling for community-level factors, including
among others: county-level measures for the penetration of MA coverage among eligibles, the
concentration of MA dental coverage among MA enrollees by race/ethnicity and income, and the
market supply of dental providers. The study results will be directly relevant to current, national-level policy
decisions around how to improve oral health access to the Medicare population, particularly among
underserved groups."
10820414,"SUMMARY
 An emerging theme in neurodevelopmental research is that both loss of function and overexpression of
the same pathogenic gene can result in autism-associated phenotypes. For many disorders, such precise
requirements for protein dosage have complicated what was once thought to be a linear path to gene therapy.
This challenge is epitomized by Rett syndrome, a monogenic neurodevelopmental disorder caused by loss of
function mutations in a methyl-reader known as Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2). On the surface, RTT
appears to be an ideal candidate for gene therapy; however, targeting MeCP2 itself with traditional gene
replacement strategies is complicated by a stringent requirement for protein dosage, whereby even a 1-fold
increase over neurotypical levels evokes adverse effects. The practical challenge created by these narrow
dosage requirements is that, not only does viral MeCP2 delivery need to be efficient across the entire human
brain, but each must cell receive roughly the same, relatively small amount. One endogenous mechanism used
to fine-tune MeCP2 expression is via microRNA (miRNA) regulation of its 3’untranslated region (UTR). As the
contribution of each miRNA to MeCP2 expression is modest by nature, we hypothesized that preventing the
binding of repressive-miRNAs would be a viable approach to increase MeCP2 dosage, yet remain within its
narrow safety margins. To test this hypothesis, we developed locked nucleic acid (LNA) site blocking (sb) ASOs
designed to outcompete mir-22, mir-132, and mir-483 for binding to the MeCP2 3’UTR. In support of our
hypothesis, increasing concentrations of each ASO in vitro resulted in increasing amounts of MeCP2 protein to
a point that plateaued at a 0.75 to 4-fold increase, depending on the miRNA site being blocked. We contend that
this approach is ideally suited for patients with common missense or late-truncating mutations, where some
function is preserved and where overexpression of the mutant protein is known to improve phenotypes in mice.
In patients, eight MeCP2 mutations are responsible for 70% of all RTT cases, and five of these are missense
and late-truncating, potentially suggesting a broad utility. In Aim 1, we will use fibroblast and iPSC-derived
neurons from RTT patients to determine the subpopulations where overexpression of the mutant protein
demonstrates efficacy. In Aim 2, we will use osmotic micropumps to deliver a dose-response of each sbASO to
Mecp2T158M/y mice and establish a therapeutic range for efficacy and adverse effects. The T158M mouse model
was chosen because transgenic overexpression of the mutant allele has already been shown to be effective at
improving phenotypes. In recent years, advancements in ASO chemistry have removed many of the long-
standing barriers preventing their clinical development. Here we propose that LNA-modified ASOs designed to
outcompete endogenous miRNA for MeCP2 regulation are a viable therapeutic approach for RTT patients with
missense or late-truncating mutations."

Vibrio cholerae is a human pathogen that colonizes small intestines, resulting in the onset of a severe diarrheal
disease known as cholera. Once reaching the small intestine, V. cholerae establishes colonization through
virulence gene activation by the AraC-type master virulence regulator ToxT. Additionally, V. cholerae must
cope with many host defense attacks during infection, including oxidative stress from reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are key posttranscriptional regulators that assist bacteria for rapid
responses to stimuli. In our preliminary studies, we found that two sRNAs can repress expression of grxA,
encoding a glutaredoxin that responds to ROS stress by catalysis of disulfide bond reduction and protein de-
glutathionylation. S-glutathionylation, a reversible posttranslational protein modification of thiol groups of
cysteine with glutathione, can alter protein function and/or stability. We also found that the master virulence
regulator ToxT was glutathionylated (ToxT-SSG) and GrxA overproduction significantly reduced ToxT
glutathionylation. Moreover, dysregulation of grxA reduced V. cholerae virulence gene expression in vitro and
gut colonization in the infant mouse model, suggesting sRNA-mediated signaling cascades may contribute to
V. cholerae virulence via protein S-glutathionylation. We therefore hypothesize that host signals, such as ROS,
induce sRNA production, and sRNAs posttranscriptionally inhibit production of GrxA, a protein de-
glutathionylation enzyme, protect the active pool of the S-glutathionylated virulence activator ToxT, thus
contributing to the spatio-temporal regulation of V. cholerae pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we will first
determine how sRNAs regulate grxA in Aim 1. We will identify and characterize sRNA regulators of grxA using
a candidate approach and an unbiased systems approach rGRIL-Seq that relies on in vivo proximity ligation of
sRNAs bound to their targets, selective enrichment and sequencing. We will also investigate host signals that
activate sRNAs for grxA regulation. In Aim 2, we will examine the effects of GrxA-regulated S-glutathionylation
on V. cholerae virulence. Our preliminary studies also found that exogenous glutathione (GSH) reduced
virulence gene expression. GrxA uses GSH as reducing power to deglutathionate modified cysteines. We thus
hypothesize that glutathionylation promotes ToxT function and V. cholerae use lumenal GSH as a spatio-
temporal cue to guide its colonization. We will examine how glutathionylation affects ToxT function/stability. We
will also examine GrxA impacts on glutathionylation of other proteins using targeted proteomics. Finally, we will
use imaging mass cytometry to examine effects of the lumenal GSH on virulence. The proposed studies will
reveal new posttranscriptional sRNA signaling in V. cholerae redox sensing and regulation and uncover the
posttranslational protein S-glutathionylation in V. cholerae virulence control, expanding V. cholerae virulence
control beyond the extensively studied gene transcription."

Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)
being the second most common subtype. Although LUSC has been characterized by several well-defined driver
mutations, including amplifications of chromosomes 3q26, targeted therapy approaches have been unsuccessful
so far. Copy number gain or amplification of chromosome 3q occurs in more than 80% of LUSC, while progress
has been slow in developing therapeutic strategies to target this specific LUSC subtype. We have identified
several Golgi genes in this amplicon, including Golgi Integral Membrane Protein 4 (GOLIM4), which encodes a
transmembrane Golgi protein that regulates endosome-to-Golgi trafficking, and ATPase Secretory Pathway
Ca2+ Transporting 1 (ATP2C1), which encodes a Golgi-resident Ca2+/Mn2+ pump that regulates Ca2+-dependent
protein sorting and secretion. We found that GOLIM4 and ATP2C1 form a complex on the Golgi and play a
fundamental role in LUSC growth and metastasis by promoting the secretion of pro-tumorigenic proteins. In
addition, ATP2C1 regulates Mn2+ influx into the Golgi lumen, causing GOLIM4 degradation upon Mn2+ exposure.
Mn2+ treatment inhibits the growth of chromosome 3q-amplified LUSC cells in vitro and in vivo. In the proposed
work, we will explore how GOLIM4 and ATP2C1 cooperatively modulate the Golgi secretory pathway during
LUSC progression and test whether GOLIM4 and ATP2C1 co-amplification creates a therapeutic vulnerability in
chromosome 3q-amplified LUSC."

A fundamental characteristic of substance use disorder (SUD) is ongoing drug seeking and misuse despite
physical, financial, and legal consequences. Critically, aversive consequences following a substantial delay,
such as withdrawal after substance use, are often underestimated. Despite the common occurrence of delayed
punishment, cost/benefit decision-making research has focused almost entirely on punishment occurring
immediately after a choice. To address this gap, we developed the Delayed Punishment Decision-making Task
(DPDT), which reveals that rats, like humans, underestimate or “discount” the negative value of delayed
punishment during decision-making. Preliminary data obtained using DPDT reveal that orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC) inactivation increases sensitivity to delayed punishment, and OFC encodes information about
punishment delay prior to choice. While these data suggest a role of OFC in the assessment of delayed
punishment, the mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. OFC activity is sculpted by
catecholaminergic projections from distinct midbrain nuclei, specifically dopaminergic projections from the
ventral tegmental area (VTA) and noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus (LC). Our central
hypothesis is that sensitivity to delayed punishment is modulated by dopamine and norepinephrine projections
to OFC, with dopamine release from neurons arising from VTA affecting the discounting of delayed
punishment, and noradrenergic neurons from LC regulating sensitivity to punishment regardless of delay. We
will evaluate this using DREADDS for both circuit and cell-type specific manipulation of neural activity in LC or
VTA neurons projecting to OFC during DPDT. In Aim 1, we will use infuse inhibitory or excitatory DREADDS
into the VTA of TH-Cre rats, then directly stimulate these receptors in the OFC terminals prior to DPDT. This
will enable selective modulation of dopamine release in OFC. For Aim 2, we will infuse excitatory or inhibitory
DREADDS into LC, then stimulate these receptors in OFC prior to DPDT. For all manipulations in both Aims,
we will perform control experiments to confirm that manipulations are affecting sensitivity to immediate or
delayed punishment rather than pain tolerance, reward discrimination, or behavioral flexibility. Collectively,
these studies will determine a potential mechanism for how the OFC regulates sensitivity to both delayed and
immediate punishment. Moreover, these experiments will determine if direct manipulation of two understudied
neuronal circuits has efficacy as a potential treatment to improve sensitivity to delayed consequences in SUD."

Cancer immunotherapy, foremost checkpoint blockade therapy (CBT), has revolutionized the landscape of
cancer treatment. However, to date only a minority of cancer patients is experiencing a long-term clinical benefit,
while the majority of patients does not respond or progresses upon initial response. Thus far, a lack of infiltration
with tumor-reactive T cells is a highly correlative marker for the lack of sensitivity to CBT, such as anti-PD-1.
However, the reverse conclusion that a tumor-reactive T cell infiltrate would be predictive for an anti-tumor
immune response does not always stand its ground. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) only
half of the patients with a detectable tumor-reactive T cell infiltrate respond to CBT. Especially NSCLC driven by
oncogenic KRAS mutations in combination with p53-loss are frequently refractory to CBT. This observation
poses the critical question as to which additional mechanisms mediating resistance to CBT in T cell infiltrated
NSCLC subsets, and potentially also other cancer types. Further, it raises the possibility that anti-tumor immune
responses may be dominantly affected by the organs’ specific immune microenvironment. To specifically
address this notion, we have established a mouse model of KRAS/p53-driven lung adenocarcinoma, that is
resistant to CBT but at the same time shows infiltration with effector CD8+ T cells. Our data suggest, that despite
a high degree of T cell infiltration the CD8+ T cells infiltrating lung tumors are intrinsically dysfunctional, rendering
the T cell response incapable of eradicating tumor cells. These differences were found to be independent of the
tumor-specific antigen and rather imprinted at the time of T cell activation in the lung tumor-draining mediastinal
lymph node. Further, the lung tumor-specific T cell dysfunction observed is strikingly different to the conventional
T cell exhaustion phenotype often described as PD1+, Lag3+, Tim3+, and highly sensitive to CBT therapy. Based
on these observations it is our central hypothesis that lung-specific T cell dysfunction is a unique and persisting
state of T cell activation, induced by lung-derived dendritic cells during priming in the mediastinal lymph node
and characterized by impaired anti-tumor effector function. By determining the immunological underpinnings that
are responsible for the observed T cell dysfunction (Aim 1) and stimulatory capacity of dendritic cells (Aim 2),
we will be able to elucidate yet undiscovered immune suppression mechanisms mediating immune evasion in T
cell-inflamed tumors. By better understanding how lung-restricted anti-tumor immunity is induced we will be able
to facilitate the development of novel immunotherapies. While this grant will focus on lung cancer it is conceivable
that any identified mechanisms are more broadly applicable. The ultimate premise will always be to increase the
number of patients with a durable anti-tumor immune response and long-term, durable clinical benefits."

Aging, the progressive deterioration of tissue and organ function, is the largest risk factor for
developing disease. Increasing evidence points to the accumulation of damaged cell cycle-arrested cells with
age (cellular senescence) as a cause for the development of certain aging-associated diseases. Clearance
of senescent cells results in improvement in age-related phenotypes. Accordingly, limiting the emergence of
senescent cells is expected to mitigate age-related phenotypes. Recent studies, including our own, point to
aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome number, as a feature of senescent cells.
Our recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate that cell competition, the elimination of
cells based on their difference from other neighboring cells rather than their intrinsic properties, is a means
for removing aneuploid cells because of copy number changes in Ribosomal protein (Rp) genes. In particular,
cell competition that eliminates aneuploid cells is anticipated to prevent the accumulation of senescent cells.
The 80 eukaryotic Rp genes map across the entire chromosome complement, thus aneuploidy or other large-
scale genome changes almost always affect their copy number making cell competition based on Rp gene
dosage a strategic mode to recognize and eliminate aneuploid cells. A specific mutation affecting RpS12 in
Drosophila prevents the elimination of Rp+/- cells by cell competition, and permits greater survival of aneuploid
cells in Drosophila. We will test whether a homologous process affects incidence of aneuploidy and aging
phenotypes in a novel mouse model, Rps12 mutant mouse strains, and an aneuploidy induced mouse model
whereby aneuploidy is induced by reduced expression of Bub1, an essential kinase for proper chromosome
segregation.
 In Aim 1 we will Determine whether Rps12D90/D90 mice accumulate aneuploid cells, focusing on the
cortex. Prior studies establish that aneuploidy is prominent in the embryonic cortex but decreases significantly
in frequency by 4-month post-partum, consistent with loss of aneuploid cells during this period. Using custom
developed assays for the quantification of aneuploidy in single cells we will measure aneuploid cell
frequencies at E13.5 and at 4 months post-partum in RpS12 mutant cortex and in wild type cortex from sibling
controls. These assays will establish whether RpS12 plays a conserved role in recognizing and eliminating
spontaneous aneuploid cells in mouse cortex. In Aim 2 we will lineage-trace aneuploid cells to determine
whether Rps12D90/D90 mice are defective for eliminating aneuploid cells. Conditional reduction in Bub1
expression driven by Homeobox protein 1 -Emx1-Cre will generate clones of Bub1 defective aneuploid cells
that will be identified, in the ROSAnT-nG lineage-tracing background, as cells expressing EGFP rather than
tdTomato. FACS analysis of isolated nuclei from whole brain will provide EGFP/tdTomato ratios to specifically
address roles of RpS12 in aneuploid cell survival or elimination. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will perform a longitudinal
study to assess the health of aging Rps12D90/D90 mice. Assays for physical, behavioral, metabolic, and
inflammatory deterioration that mark aging will be performed on young (6 months) and aged (22 months old)
Rps12D90/D90 mice in comparison with matched controls to assess aging.
 Globally, these studies represent a first exploration in mammals of the hypothesis that cell competition
can prevent the accumulation of senescent cell by eliminating those aneuploid cells that reduce Rp gene copy
number, as is the case in Drosophila and will determine if the role of RpS12 in this process is conserved and
can be exploited as a potential route to rejuvenation."

The rotator cuff muscles allow for movement of the arm and shoulder and are particularly
susceptible to tear with age. Age-related muscle degeneration is alarming as an ever-increasing
aging US population burdens our health care system. While surgical intervention strategies for
rotator cuff tears exist, in many instances the muscle fails to regenerate after surgery, leading to
a significant and variable rate of retear for 10-50% of patients, depending on the study. Risk
factors for retear include age, gender, and pre-operative tear size; however, the interdependency
of each risk factor is unknown. Moreover, at the cellular and molecular level, myofibers, satellite
cells, stromal cells, and immune cells dynamically regulate the regeneration processes. While its
known cell populations shift occurs with age, gender, and rotator cuff tear, no study has evaluated
the dynamics of cell pathology across patient populations. In this proposal, the Hicks and Gupta
labs will test two hypothesis that 1) the cellular composition of chronic human RCTs inhibits SC
regeneration through inflammatory factors and/or fibrosis, and 2) chronic human muscle injury
leads to exhaustion and senescence of the SC pool, thereby leading to accelerated degeneration.
In Aim 1, we will use high-dimensional imaging mass cytometry to quantify immune-stromal-
muscle heterogeneity as well as phenotypic markers of senescence and activation. Imaging mass
cytometry can achieve multiplex staining upwards of 40 antibodies on a single tissue, enabling
significant refinement of complex cellular phenotypes and histopathological classification of
clinical tissue samples. We expect to find will unique molecular signatures clustered by age,
gender, and Goutallier grade, thus providing predictive measures of muscle regeneration
following rotator cuff tear. In Aim 2, we will test the functional status of SCs and stromal cells in
vitro using three main assays, senescence: via live cell imaging, trans differentiation: via fibrotic
and adipogenic stimulating factors, and stromal cell regulation of muscle regeneration: via co-
culturing stromal populations with satellite cells. Results from these assays will guide the use of
anti-senescent or anti-fibrotic drugs in vitro. This study serves as a basis for understanding the
intrinsic and extrinsic defects in skeletal muscle repair and will shed light on both predicting
outcomes of rotator cuff tear surgery and identifying new treatments that could improve muscle
regeneration for aging and muscle tears."

the larger infectious disease group, investigators in the ND INBRE at UND, NDSU, and Minot State University,
and other non-associated investigators at UND, NDSU, and the USDA Human Nutrition Center. During Phase
1 the Core was able to replace the obsolete BD LSR2 with a BD Symphony with funds from both this COBRE
and the ND INBRE, and later to add a third flow cytometer, a Sony MA900 Cell Sorter, with funds from the
DaCCoTA CTR, as well as to increase the number of licenses for FlowJo analytical software held by the Core
for use predominately by the HPI COBRE investigators. The Core will continue with the services provided
moving into Phase 2, as well as initiating full service for those investigators wanting the Core to perform the
collection of flow cytometric data on their prepared/stained cells, as well as continued fluorescent cell sorting
for the COBRE, INBRE, and CTR investigators, as well as non-associated researchers across North Dakota.
To ensure ongoing sustainability, a fee for service or instrument usage fee will be implemented during the
Phase 2 period of the COBRE for all users of the Core."
10789943,"Single cells infected by influenza can produce hundreds to thousands of infectious new virions. These virions spread non-uniformly, producing wide variations in the viral load per cell that are concentrated around the initial site of infection. Differences in the amount of virus that infects a particular cell can influence whether or not that cell produces new virions of its own, or if it mounts an anti-viral response. Understanding how influenza virions spread is therefore critical to understanding how infection progresses and how the host responds. The central goal of this project is to understand how genetic and biophysical features of both virus and host contribute to the spatial structure of influenza virus cellular spread, and how differences in cellular spread shape the progression of infection and the resulting cellular responses. Our prior data demonstrate that genetic and biophysical features of influenza control the way that the virus spreads at the cellular level. These features are strongly linked to three viral proteins in particular: HA, NA, and M1. The receptor-binding protein HA mediates virus attachment to naïve cells, while the receptor-destroying protein NA facilitates virus release and dissemination. The matrix protein M1 controls the shape of the virus particle and the distribution of HA and NA on the virion surface. Collectively, these proteins control the biophysical characteristics of virus particles and shape the way that virions spread throughout the host. We hypothesize that genetic mechanisms acting through these proteins, together with host factors involved in mucociliary clearance, determine the spatial pattern of viral spread and the frequency of cellular co-infection, thereby shaping the progression of disease. We will test this hypothesis through two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use high- resolution imaging to track the spread of virions and viral infection, and we will determine how this depends on natural variations in HA, NA, and M1. Through these experiments, we will identify how these proteins collectively influence the degree of cellular co-infection that occurs during multi-cycle virus replication. In Aim 2, we will investigate how host factors involved in mucociliary clearance contribute to cellular spread of IAV, and we will determine the collective impact of viral and host factors that alter the frequency of co-infection on key infection outcomes in differentiated human airway cells. The expected outcome of this project is an improved understanding of how influenza virus surface and structural proteins contribute to intracellular aspects of viral replication by tuning the degree of co-infection that occurs during multi-cycle growth. Insights from this work will inform basic understanding of how influenza viruses navigate the host environment and will identify host and viral factors that contribute to the disparate outcomes of infection that are sometimes observed. This proposal will also introduce new tools and methodologies for investigating the spatial organization and dynamics of influenza virus infection."
10831088,"Anti-androgenic therapy is the mainstay for both primary and disseminated forms of prostate cancer. FDA-
approved enzalutamide (Xtandi) is at the forefront of anti-androgens with superior patient profile and is the one
most prescribed. However, enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer (ERPC) invariably develops, which is
incurable and responsible for most of the prostate cancer-related deaths, underscoring that management of
ERPC is an unmet and urgent medical need. Development of an effective therapy against ERPC is suffering
from lack of proper understanding about critical molecular targets to effectively kill ERPC cells. To identify
potential new targets, we developed an ERPC model which mimics the clinical conditions in patients undergoing
standard enzalutamide therapy. We treated androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells with enzalutamide in long-
term culture to generate cell lines (LNCaP-ENR, PCa-2B-ENR) which are no longer sensitive to clinically relevant
doses of enzalutamide. Comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed that the ERPC cells overexpress
Tribbles 2 (Trib2), a member of the tribbles pseudokinase family. Overexpression of Trib2 was also found in PDX
and patient prostate tumors after enzalutamide treatment. Forced overexpression Trib2 results in enhanced
prostate cancer cell growth and resistance to enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide and abiraterone.
Inhibition of Trib2 re-sensitizes resistant cells to enzalutamide and decreases their viability, indicating a possible
direct link between Trib2 and development of enzalutamide resistance. Interestingly, Trib2 downregulates Rb1
and p53, while induces the neuronal transcription factors (N-Myc, BRN2) and the neuroendocrine (NE) markers
(Chromogranin A, Neuron-specific enolase and Synaptophysin). Inhibition of N-Myc or BRN2 re-sensitizes
resistant cells to enzalutamide. These findings suggest that Trib2 drives cellular trans-differentiation from luminal
to NE phenotype to pose resistance to anti-androgens. Thus, Trib2 emerges as a novel, promising molecular
target for therapy of ERPC-NE. However, the mechanism and role of Trib2 in NE differentiation needs to be
determined using appropriate in vitro and in vivo models. Thus, this proposal has been designed which will
characterize how Trib2 induces NE differentiation (Aim 1), determine the impact of Trib2 inhibition in enhanced
ERPC tumor growth and distant metastasis (Aim 2), and test the impact of Trib2 gene-targeting on prostate
tumor progression and NE differentiation using transgenic Trib2 knockout mouse models (Aim 3). Accomplishing
these goals will establish Trib2 as a molecular driver for treatment-induced NE differentiation and will help
develop a new targeted therapeutic strategy for enzalutamide resistant, NE type, lethal prostate cancer."
10874524,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Years of genetic research on various complex human traits have implicated several genetic
variants as risk factors for two or more diseases/traits, including seemingly unrelated traits. A
recent systematic evaluation of >500 traits from >4100 genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
has revealed that 90% of the variants associated with these traits influence at least two traits.
This phenomenon where a genetic region or locus confers risk to more than one trait is known as
pleiotropy. Discovering patterns of pleiotropy is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of
biological mechanisms of human diseases and traits (e.g. understand how genetic variation leads
to trait variation and inter-trait correlations, and how traits may be causally related to each other),
and can have translational impact in the long run (e.g. guide identification of molecular targets or
help predict side-effects in drug development). While the scientific significance of studying
pleiotropy or genetic overlap is well-understood, statistical methods for identifying common
genetic basis between traits are still lacking. This is especially true for traits sampled under a
family-based design. To address methodological challenges in investigating pleiotropy, in Aim 1,
we propose a novel, innovative statistical method for identifying common genetic variants
influencing two possibly correlated traits. In Aim 2, we non-trivially extend our method in Aim 1 to
identify rare genetic variants influencing two independent traits. We use only aggregate-level
genotype-phenotype association results (or GWAS summary statistics), thus helping protect
human subjects data and facilitating global collaborations. The proposed methods, while having
the potential to substantially outperform current approaches in the area, will be more general and
distinct from existing research efforts in the following ways: applicability to correlated traits (Aim
1; e.g. a disease-related endophenotype and a molecular trait, or two different -omics traits), to
traits measured on independent sets of individuals (Aims 1, 2; e.g. separate case-control studies
on two diseases), to traits sharing some samples (Aim 1; e.g. case-control studies with shared
controls), to study designs where individuals may not be randomly sampled or unrelated (Aims
1, 2; e.g. case-parent trio design), to rare variants (Aim 2), and our open-access tools will allow
genomics researchers across the world to readily adopt and apply our methods even in resource-
poor environments (Aims 1, 2). Successful implementation of these aims will provide the broader
scientific community with novel, powerful and scalable methods, along with well-documented free
software, to statistically investigate questions of pleiotropy between complex human diseases/
traits across the entire allele frequency spectrum using GWAS summary statistics only."
10873209,"The decidua is a specially modified mucosa that harbors a unique composition of leukocytes. Despite the
importance of maternal-fetoplacental immune interactions during pregnancy, the gestationally-driven population
dynamics of decidual leukocytes has been difficult to ascertain, and the transition from the menstrual cycle to
early pregnancy is not readily studied in human pregnancy. Disturbance of the mechanisms that regulate
population maintenance and trafficking of decidual leukocytes at the maternal-fetal interface is thought to
underlie morbidity and mortality in pregnancy (i.e., preeclampsia, preterm labor, fetal growth restriction) and
presents a powerful diagnostic and therapeutic target. Thus, this R21 Exploratory/Developmental Grant
application aims to establish a novel pregnant macaque model defining trafficking of peripheral blood cells to the
decidua using the novel technique of serial intravascular staining (SIVS) with the following Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1: To determine the trafficking and population dynamics of decidual lymphocytes, including
decidual NK cells, in pregnant rhesus monkeys. We will test the hypothesis that trafficking from the peripheral
blood and proliferation and apoptosis of tissue-resident decidual lymphocytes drive population dynamics across
pregnancy. Further, the distribution of these lymphocytes with respect to the decidual vasculature will provide
insight into their function and mechanisms of trafficking.
Specific Aim 2. To determine the trafficking of peripheral blood lymphocytes, including NK cells, to the
nonpregnant endometrium. We will test the hypothesis that the trafficking of lymphocytes to the developing
maternal-fetal interface is initiated in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, independent of the presence
of an embryo or developing placenta.
Our proposed studies will answer the following fundamental questions: Which lymphocytes actively traffic
between systemic vasculature and decidual residency during pregnancy? What is the balance of cell proliferation
and cell death of decidua-resident lymphocytes across gestation? What is the distribution of trafficking and
resident lymphocytes relative to the vasculature within the decidua? And, is trafficking from the blood to the
uterus initiated in the luteal phase in preparation for the establishment of pregnancy? Determining the origin and
dynamics of decidual lymphocytes is necessary to advance the hypothesis of their pivotal role in hemochorial
placentation into clinically actionable intelligence. The R21 Exploratory/Developmental Grant mechanism
supports research projects in their early and conceptual stages. The application of the SIVS paradigm to the
pregnant nonhuman primate model could have a major impact on our understanding of the reproductive
immunology of the maternal-fetal interface. Furthermore, these methodologies for assessing trafficking of
immune cells in vivo in the nonhuman primate model will be powerful tools to apply to other experimental settings,
including infectious disease in pregnancy and hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplantation."
10832661,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia and sepsis are life-threatening conditions
whose clinical and biological manifestations are frequently interwoven: pneumonia is a common cause of
sepsis, and both are predisposing conditions for ARDS. While progress has been made to reduce mortality in
these conditions, their significant heterogeneity is a major factor limiting therapeutic progress. Future
interventions must be informed by an improved understanding of phenotypes and endotypes within these
conditions to better design clinical trials. The proposed Great Lakes Clinical Center (GLCC) of the ARDS,
Pneumonia and Sepsis (APS) Consortium, consisting of the University of Michigan, Henry Ford Hospital, the
University of Cincinnati, and the University of Chicago will screen, enroll, collect data and transport
biospecimens on at least 1000 patients of this 5000-patient observational study over a 6-year period.
Clinical information and biospecimens from the index hospitalization and from long-term follow up at 3, 6 and
12 months will be collected. Biospecimens will include blood, stool, pharyngeal swabs, and endotracheal
aspirates. Specimens will be transported to the Clinical Coordinating Center for storage and future analysis.
The rich database we propose will provide investigators with innumerable opportunities to biologically
interrogate the heterogeneity of APS patients. Included in this database are opportunities for investigators to
study clinical disease trajectories; blood cytokines, DNA, RNA, and metabolites; gastrointestinal and
respiratory microbiota; and chest and body imaging. In addition, we propose two unique data collection
approaches: morphometric characterization of CT images (to rigorously characterize body composition) and
nasal epithelial curettage (to study the host transcriptomic response within the respiratory tract).
We also propose a Center-specific study that will elucidate the role of the microbiome in the development,
trajectory, and recovery of ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis. The microbiome is an important yet incompletely
understood source of biologic heterogeneity, and represents a highly promising treatment target. Yet we lack
an actionable understanding of its role in these conditions. Our team will leverage the above-described
specimen and data collection with field-leading methodological expertise to (Aim 1) identify the pathways by
which gut and respiratory microbiota participate in the acute development and trajectory of sepsis, ARDS, and
pneumonia and (Aim 2) determine the microbial and metabolic pathways by which gut microbiota influence
long-term recovery after these conditions. We will use cutting-edge molecular techniques to characterize the
microbiome and its metabolic products, and we will use sophisticated causal inference analyses to study the
mediating role of the microbiome in clinical outcomes. By interrogating the role of the microbiome in the
development, trajectory, and recovery of these conditions, this project will facilitate the development of
microbiome-targeted therapies for their prevention and treatment."

A cardinal feature of anxiety disorders is exaggerated fear to cues signaling threat. Pharmacotherapies to treat
anxiety disorders overwhelmingly target the diffuse modulatory, serotonergic system, but have limited efficacy.
Dopamine is a diffuse, modulatory neurotransmitter known to regulate fear. Yet, dopamine-focused treatments
for anxiety disorders are not available. This proposal will test the novel hypothesis that A8 dopamine neurons
originating in the retrorubral field normally function to promote fear through projections to the ventral pallidum.
We have developed a discrimination procedure in which a minimal threat cue predicts foot shock on 10% of
trials, while a neutral cue never predicts shock. Rats show selective, modest fear to the minimal threat cue,
allowing us to observe fear exaggeration or fear inhibition via manipulation of A8 dopamine activity. Aim 1 will
reveal A8 dopamine bidirectionally controls ventral pallidum firing to a threat cue and cue-elicited fear. Th-cre
rats will receive bilateral intra-A8 infusion of a cre-dependent excitatory DREADD (hM3D), inhibitory DREADD
(hM4D), or a control fluorophore. All rats will receive Neuropixels implant along a striatum-pallidum axis. Single
units will be recorded from the ventral pallidum and additional striatal regions during minimal threat learning
when A8 dopamine activity is intact, chemogenetically excited or chemogenetically inhibited. Results will show
that hM3D stimulation of A8 dopamine suppresses ventral pallidum firing and exaggerates fear to minimal
threat, while hM4D inhibition of A8 dopamine permits ventral pallidum firing and inhibits fear to minimal threat.
Aim 2 will directly tie bidirectional control of fear to activity in the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway. Th-
cre rats will receive bilateral, intra-A8 infusion of cre-dependent channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, or a control
fluorophore. Optical ferrules will be bilaterally implanted over the ventral pallidum, permitting temporally-
specific manipulations of the A8 to ventral pallidum pathway. Light illumination will occur during cue or control
periods during the minimal threat learning procedure. Results will show that channelrhodopsin stimulation of
the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway exaggerates fear to minimal threat, while halorhodopsin inhibition
of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway inhibits fear to minimal threat. This proposal will uncover a
novel dopaminergic pathway that normally functions to promote fear. Simultaneously, the results will reveal
selective inhibition of the A8 dopamine to ventral pallidum pathway as a promising target to effectively treat
anxiety disorders."
10875592,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a human pathogen that causes the most serious forms of acute and chronic liver
disease. There is no effective licensed therapy for this virus, which has a unique replication cycle that is not
well understood. The HDV genome is a circular single stranded RNA that uses host RNA polymerase II for
replication. In addition to the genome, two antigenomesense RNAs are produced in infected cells: the circular
antigenome, which serves as a template for genome synthesis, and an mRNA, which encodes a nucleocapsid-
like protein called the hepatitis delta antigen. The genome and antigenome are synthesized by a rolling circle
mechanism in which the polymerase initiates, then transits the circular RNA template numerous times. Newly
made RNAs are cleaved by ribozymes into unit-length monomers that are ligated into circles by a host RNA
ligase. These processes determine the amount of viral RNA that accumulates in infected cells, which in turn
affect virus spread, persistence and host responses, but their mechanisms and dynamics are not well
understood. In recent work, in which we identified the position at which synthesis of genome RNA initiates, we
developed tools to track these processes by following the 5’ ends of RNAs generated during rolling circle
replication – one 5’ end is the initiate site, the other is the 5’ end created by ribozyme cleavage. The genome 5’
end itself is unusual in that it starts with a G that is either untemplated or templated in an unusual way, such as
by a U rather than C. Our methods provide new approaches to analyzing the early stages of HDV RNA
synthesis in ways that have not been possible. This proposal is directed at exploiting these new approaches to
determine the dynamics of HDV RNA synthesis in infected cells and, in turn, to determine the HDV sequences
and structures that affect initiation and elongation. There are two aims. In Aim 1 we will identify the sequence
and structural determinants that determine where and how efficiently HDV genome RNA and mRNA synthesis
initiates. We will analyze different HDV isolates and genotypes, including a recently identified ”HDV-like” virus.
In Aim 2 we will characterize the dynamics of HDV genome and antigenome RNA synthesis during the course
of HDV replication in cells. We will thus determine the relative contributions of initiation and elongation HDV
RNA levels and identify how changes in these contributions affect changes in HDV RNA levels during
replication in cells."
10805469,"Neonicotinoids are pesticides used worldwide and humans are ubiquitously exposed to them.
They are selective for invertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAchRs) with a low affinity
for mammalian ones, a trait that has contributed to their widespread use and assumed safety in
mammals. However, an increasing body of evidence in vertebrates indicates developmental and
adult exposure to neonicotinoids negatively affects a broad range of physiological processes
including immune, reproductive, and metabolic systems. However, relatively little is known about
the mechanisms by which neonicotinoid exposure alters learning and memory or perturbs
neurophysiological signaling pathways. Learning and memory are fundamental cognitive
functions regulated in large part by the hippocampus and striatum of the brain. This is done, in
part, through activation of two forms of nAchRs; α2ß4 and α7. The objective of this proposal is to
test the global hypothesis that neonicotinoid exposure, gestationally or in adulthood, impairs
performance on spatial and procedural memory tasks by perturbing expression of α2ß4 or α7
receptor expression and acetylcholine release. To address this hypothesis, we will treat adult
mice, or pregnant dams, with vehicle, or the environmentally relevant doses of 5.7 mg/kg/day and
0.5 mg/kg/day of imidacloprid. Imidacloprid is the most commonly used neonicotinoid and it has
been detected in samples from children and adults. Adult and gestationally exposed mice will be
tested for spatial memory and reward learning memory (Aim 1). Following behavioral testing,
brains from these animals will be isolated and the protein and mRNA expression of α2ß4 or α7
nAchRs and their subunits will be quantified (Aim 2). Lastly, in adult exposed animals, we will use
a virus-mediated fluorescent acetylcholine sensor and fiber photometry to measure acetylcholine
release targeting the hippocampus while a freely moving animal is engaged in a spatial working
task (Aim 3). We predict males will be more sensitive to neonicotinoids than females and thus
have a significantly disrupted performance on memory tasks and have a larger increase in nAchR
expression in the brain. We also predict that adult exposure will have a larger effect on nAchR
expression compared to gestational exposure. Finally, we predict that imidacloprid exposed
animals will have a reduction in acetylcholine release in response to a memory task. The results
of this novel and comprehensive study will provide a critical identification of possible mechanisms
underlying the impact of neonicotinoids on learning and memory."
10873342,"Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado-Joseph disease, is one of at least nine
diseases caused by CAG repeat expansions that encode abnormally long polyglutamine tracts in the disease
proteins. Despite advances in disease understanding, much remains unknown about how the CAG expansion
in the SCA3 disease gene, ATXN3, causes brain dysfunction and cell death. We recently discovered selective
oligodendrocyte vulnerability across SCA3 mouse disease brain regions and identified early and robust
changes that implicate oligodendrocytes in disease pathogenesis. Our long-term objective is to understand
pathogenic mechanisms in SCA3 and related polyglutamine diseases so that therapies targeting the most
promising molecular and cellular targets can be developed for these fatal and currently untreatable disorders.
Toward that objective, the team of investigators will leverage their diverse research expertise and a wide range
of model systems including primary cell cultures, mouse models, and human disease tissue. Building on recent
discoveries in mouse models and human disease tissue, we will investigate nonneuronal contributions to
disease pathogenesis, with an emphasis on cells of the oligodendroglial lineage. In Aim 1, we will determine
how widespread oligodendrocyte dysfunction is in SCA3 disease. In Aim 2, we will generate novel conditional
SCA3 mouse models to establish if the mutant protein elicits cell-autonomous oligodendrocyte dysfunction and
define oligodendrocyte dysfunction contributions to disease pathogenesis. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the
molecular mechanisms that underlie oligodendrocyte dysfunction in SCA3 disease. Results of these studies
will help guide therapeutic development in SCA3 and related polyglutamine diseases."
10833205,"Botanical dietary supplement use has skyrocketed over the last ten years. One significant portion of this market
is herbal supplements targeted toward women, who commonly use them to treat their gynecological ailments,
not only for their cost-effective advantage or affordability, but also for their health benefits. Progesterone is an
endogenous hormone and synthetic progestins are used therapeutically for a variety of conditions including
prevention of uterine hyperplasia, which increases the risk of uterine cancer, uterine bleeding, endometriosis,
and prevention of preterm birth. Selective progesterone receptor (PR) modulators are also used in the treatment
of prevention of fibroids, which occur in 80% of women. At a national level, treating benign gynecological
conditions is expensive, with an annual cost of between $13–$22 billion. Thus, studying alternative therapies
that women are already widely consuming is significant. However, a major technological and scientific gap
exists: while botanicals are being widely consumed and contain compounds that are relatively safe, these
compounds have not been identified or rigorously biologically evaluated, which is an area of emphasis for NCCIH
(NOT-AT-21-006) that is specifically addressed in this application. Phytoprogestins need to be identified and
studied in order to apply them for safe and effective use in uterine disorders. To address this, our team laid the
groundwork for this new subfield of chemodietary prevention through the identification and biological
characterization of molecules from dogwood, vitex, red clover, and yucca, as these contained compounds that
modified PR signaling. In the current proposal our goal is to identify the structures of compounds in several other
commonly consumed botanicals that modify PR signaling so that they can be examined for safety and efficacy
in preclinical chemodietary prevention models, including prevention of fibroids, preterm birth and uterine
hyperplasia. We aim to test our hypothesis that commonly consumed botanicals used to improve women’s health
contain compounds that regulate PR signaling via three integrated aims. We will 1) Isolate and characterize the
structures of phytoprogestin natural products from validated plant material through use of a cell-based PRE-
luciferase assays and measure active compound abundance in commercial products; 2) Confirm that isolated
compounds bind to a receptor, determine if they function as agonists, antagonists, or potentiators, determine if
they modify off-target receptors, and refine their genome-wide transcriptional action using RNA seq; and 3)
Confirm that chemodietary prevention using phytoprogestin-containing botanicals reduces preterm birth, uterine
hyperplasia or blunts fibroid growth. Since little is known about phytoprogestin content and their associated
biological activities from botanicals widely consumed by women, this study presents a profound opportunity to
inform the treatment of gynecologic disorders and increase awareness in those consuming these botanicals
already. Further, because women are already consuming these botanicals, studies should be conducted to
understand their progesterone-modifying properties even if synthetic compounds exist."

driven purely by data. In the medical domain, clinical knowledge is often available and useful, but is mostly
ignored in the current practice of AI research. Incorporating clinical knowledge into deep learning modeling
requires an in-depth understanding of medical context/workflow. This calls for multi-disciplinary
collaborative research using computational techniques and clinical sciences to advance the biomedical

combines imaging data and clinical knowledge to augment breast cancer diagnosis, risk assessment, and
lesion detection. We will develop technical innovations on breast imaging to address deep learning
modeling on small datasets, longitudinal examinations, and content-efficient images, through three specific
aims: Aim 1: Formulate auxiliary tasks/assessment into model training of CNNs for breast cancer diagnosis
on small datasets; Aim 2: Employ biological relationships of images to guide deep learning structure design
for breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal data; Aim 3: Develop a knowledge-guided unsupervised
pipeline for identification of a suspicion map to support deep learning analysis on content-efficient images.
These aims represent novel applied methodological development to build roust deep learning models for
important clinical imaging applications. We have strong preliminary results for each aim and an
experienced research team covering computational, biomedical, engineering, and clinical sciences. Our
proposed study has a broader impact on developing robust and innovative AI strategies/methods to enable
clinical imaging AI applications. Going beyond breast imaging, our proposed concepts, paradigms, and
methods can also be adapted/applicable to other diseases and imaging modalities, leading to benefits for a
wide range of biomedical imaging analyses. Any algorithms, knowledge, insights, and experience gained
from this study will have a direct and substantial impact on the rapid evolvement and applications of
medical imaging AI devices, ultimately benefiting the researchers, clinicians, and patients."
10893464,"ABSTRACT
Cancer is clearly a disease of aging. This connection between aging and cancer incidence is especially
true in the case of skin cancer, which is the most common form of human cancer, accounting for more
than all other cancers combined in USA. The major objective of this application is to gain understanding
of cellular and molecular mechanisms that link age-related skin changes to the initiation of skin cancer.
This application is based on our findings that fibroblasts in aged human skin express elevated levels of a
matricellular protein named CCN1, and that elevated CCN1 acts to deleteriously alter the dermal
compartment of skin to create a microenvironment that enhances cancer initiation. Based on these
observations, we have created genetically modified mice that express elevated levels of CCN1 selectively
in dermal fibroblasts (source of elevated CCN1 in aged human skin). These mice exhibit strikingly
accelerated dermal aging and display multiple hallmarks of aging that are seen in human skin. Importantly,
mice that express elevated levels of CCN1 in the dermis also have a high propensity for skin tumor
initiation. These results provide direct support for the overarching hypothesis of this application; that age-
related changes in the dermal microenvironment, driven by fibroblast expression of CCN1, create a dermal
microenvironment that enhances initiation of keratinocyte cancer. We propose to test this hypothesis with
the following specific aims. Aim 1: define the impact of CCN1-induced accelerated dermal aging on
keratinocyte cancer initiation. Aim 2: test the hypothesis that activation of the hepatocyte growth factor
pathway by the CCN1-induced dermal aging microenvironment drives keratinocyte cancer initiation. Aim
3: using targeted gene deletion, test the requirement for CCN1 expression in dermal fibroblasts for the
development of an aging-related dermal microenvironment and initiation of keratinocyte cancer. The aims
of this proposal directly address the objectives of the National Cancer Institute/National Aging Institute
Funding Opportunity Announcement to understand mechanisms by which age-related alterations in the
cellular niche/microenvironment contribute to cancer initiation."
10906755,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Age is one of the most clearly defined risk factors for cancer. As the incidence of cancer increases with age,
rising more rapidly beginning in mid-life (ages 45-64 years), cancer can be considered an age-related disease.
Recent studies have identified age-dependent somatic mutations, including alleles with a role in cancer initiation,
in a spectrum of human tissues. In the hematopoietic system this is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH) and is
most commonly caused by mutations in the epigenetic regulators DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 within the
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment. How the aging process promotes clonal selection,
expansion, and transformation from CH to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly understood. The long-term
goal of this research is to understand the mechanisms by which aging promotes transformation causing
hematologic malignancies. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which
increased inflammation observed during aging promotes expansion of CH-mutant HSPCs, and the extent to
which this fitness advantage is provided by altered epigenetic regulation occurring as a direct consequence of
CH mutations. Preliminary data show that CH-mutant HSPCs have a more potent selective advantage and
undergo more rapid malignant transformation in aged compared to young mice. Mechanistically, increased
inflammation in aged mice is a driver of this phenotype and epigenetic alterations are found to accumulate in
CH-mutant HSPCs with aging. These data support the central hypothesis that aging-associated inflammation is
a selective pressure favoring CH-mutant HSPC expansion and malignant transformation, and that clonal
expansion, epigenetic alterations, and risk of transformation caused by CH mutations are dependent upon
sustained CH-mutant allele expression. This project will use cellular and molecular biological approaches in aged
mice integrated with studies using primary human CH samples to achieve the following specific aims: AIM 1.
Determine the extent to which clonal hematopoietic expansion and leukemic transformation in the aging context
is due to inflammation; and AIM 2. Determine the mechanisms by which, and extent to which, reversion of a CH
mutation during aging alters clonal evolution and risk of leukemia initiation. The proposed research is
conceptually innovative because it is the first to determine how inflammation and epigenetic dysregulation
conspire during the aging process to expand, evolve and transform CH-mutant clones. The proposed research
is technically innovative as it incorporates novel co-culture systems and therapeutic studies to assess key
inflammatory drivers, as well as a novel murine model with CH-mutant induction and reversion capabilities to
investigate CH mutant allele dependencies in clonal expansion, epigenetic alterations, and leukemic
transformation. This study is significant because understanding the mechanisms by which aging contributes to
clonal expansion and transformation will provide insights into effective therapeutic strategies targeting clonal
evolution, attenuate pathophysiology promoted by clonal expansion, and intercept malignant transformation."

This is a renewal application for the USC-Buck Geroscience Training Program in the Biology of Aging T32
Training Grant which was first funded as of May 1st, 2016. The training program is an unique cooperative
venture of the University of Southern California's Leonard Davis School of Gerontology (USC) and the Buck
Institute for Research on Aging (Buck). In 2014, in a truly joint venture, we created the very first dedicated
Biology of Aging Ph.D. program in the USA. Students take courses at both institutions, many in person but also
in a fully interactive on-line format and undertake first-year lab. rotations at both campuses before selecting a
mentor and lab. at USC or the Buck. As we come to the end of the fourth year of our T32 grant we are pleased
to report that our young PhD program is comprised of a current PhD student body of 41 PhD candidates.
Although our inaugural admission to the program was in 2014, we have already graduated 7 PhD students and
expect another 6-7 to graduate with their doctoral degrees by the end of the current grant period – average time
to degree completion is 5 years. Thirteen predoctoral trainees and six postdoctoral trainees have been
supported by our T32 grant. The goals of our Biology of Aging program are as follows: 1) To train pre-doctoral
and post-doctoral researchers who will become leaders in the biology of aging field. Our training encompasses
biochemistry, molecular biology, molecular genetics, physiology, neurobiology, computational biology,

emphasizing ethics, the responsible conduct of research, and methods for enhancing reproducibility through

these training goals, we expect our trainees to become leaders in the next generation of aging researchers."
10874775,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) keratitis is one of the most rapidly developing and destructive diseases of the
cornea and a global cause of visual impairment and blindness. Emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains poses
additional challenges for effective disease management. Development of alternative treatment is urgent.
In this regard, microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs and important regulators of gene expression.
miRNAs play critical roles in human diseases and are viable therapeutic targets. However, the roles of miRNAs
in PA keratitis remain largely unexplored. Our long-term objectives are to uncover the molecular mechanisms
of miRNAs in ocular infectious diseases, identify novel miRNA-based therapeutic targets and develop
alternative treatment of these diseases. The proposed research will directly address this knowledge gap. It is
built upon our recently published and strong preliminary data showing that application of anti-miRs targeting
the miR-183/96/182 cluster (referred to as miR-183C from here on) and knockout of miR-183C in mice
decreases corneal nerve density and neuropeptide production, while reducing the severity of PA keratitis; miR-
183C targets key genes regulating corneal sensory innervation, e.g., Nrp1, bacterium-induced sensory-neuron
activation and neuropeptide production, e.g., Toll-Like Receptor (TLR)4, Formyl Protein Receptor (Fpr)1 and
substance P (sP) precursor gene Tac1. These data lead us to the overarching hypothesis that, in addition to
innate immunity, miR-183C modulates PA keratitis through its regulation of corneal sensory nerve function and
neuroimmune interaction by targeting key genes involved in sensory innervation, PA-induced sensory-neuron
activation and pro-inflammatory neuropeptide production. Three Aims are proposed in this application to test
this hypothesis. In Aim 1, fluorescein amidites (FAM)-labeled anti-miR-183C will be applied to the cornea of
wild-type (WT) mice to test the hypothesis that anti-miR-183C treatment upregulates Tac1, TLR4, Fpr1 and
Nrp1 in corneal sensory nerves, resulting in increased pro-inflammatory neuropeptides (e.g., sP) and an early
immune/inflammatory response (<24 hours post-infection) and an accelerated sensory-nerve reduction and
decreased pro-inflammatory neuropeptides and immune/inflammatory response in a later stage during disease
resolution. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis using a sensory neuron-specific miR-183C conditional knockout
mouse model. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that knockdown or knockout of miR-183C in vitro/ex vivo in both
human and mouse sensory neurons parallels the in vivo data in that it will upregulate Tac1, TLR4 and Fpr1 to
enhance PA-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides by sensory neurons, and increase Nrp1
expression to inhibit neurite growth. A genome-wide identification of miR-183C target genes in both human and
mouse trigeminal ganglion sensory neurons will also be conducted by RNA seq.
This study will provide novel biological insights into molecular bases of miR-183C's regulation of PA keratitis
and other ocular infectious diseases. It will uncover mechanisms and reveal new targets for anti-miR therapy."

 Maternal smoking during pregnancy leads to impaired fetal lung development, decreased airway function
(forced expiratory flows), and an increased risk for wheeze/asthma in the offspring. It is an important determinant
of lifelong lower airway function and greater respiratory morbidity. In our randomized controlled trial (“Vitamin C
to Decrease Effects of Smoking in Pregnancy on Infant Lung Function” [VCSIP]), we demonstrated that vitamin
C supplementation versus placebo to pregnant smokers resulted in better airway function in the offspring at 3
and 12 months, and at 5 years of age. These differences in airway function between the offspring of the
randomized groups also increased with age. We also demonstrated a significant decrease in the occurrence of
wheeze at 4 to 6 years of age. There was no difference in prenatal or postnatal smoke exposure between the
randomized groups. All clinical participants and investigators remain blinded to treatment allocations. Mediation
analysis indicates the effect of vitamin C on wheeze is primarily due to its effect on airway function. Interventions
early in life are important as longitudinal studies demonstrate that airway function trajectories are established
early, and children in the lower airway function percentiles tend to have persistently lower airway function into
adulthood and are likely at increased risk for adult pulmonary disease. Our studies are the first and only
studies to show that an in-utero intervention targeted for a known environmental toxin can produce a
persistent increase in airway function early in life. This finding is highly relevant to the aims of the NHLBI.
 The aims of this proposal are to continue to study the offspring from the unique VCSIP study to determine
whether prenatal supplementation with vitamin C to pregnant smokers produces an improved trajectory of airway
function and lower respiratory morbidity through 10 years of age (specific aim 1). In specific aims 2 and 3 we will
examine the structural and molecular mechanisms by which vitamin C may be acting to modify the effects of
maternal smoking during pregnancy on lung development. In specific aim 2, we will use low dose high-resolution
computed tomography (HRCT) scans done at 10 years of age to determine if increased airway size underlies
the improved airway function. In specific aim 3, evaluating DNA methylation changes in serial buccal and blood
samples, we will identify critical genes and pathways most affected by maternal smoking during pregnancy and
modified by vitamin C supplementation, as well as their association with respiratory outcomes of airway function,
respiratory morbidity, and airway size. The children will be studied with yearly airway function tests, buccal
swabs, hair for nicotine levels, blood at ages 7 and 10, and a low dose HRCT scan at 10 years of age. This
follow-up will determine whether the vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers improves airway function
and respiratory morbidity into mid-childhood, determine if the mechanism for the improved airway function is
increased airway size, and explore the epigenetic changes that may underlie these beneficial effects of vitamin
C supplementation for pregnant smokers."
10887642,"Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among US women and remains a major health threat with
high incidence and lethality due to therapeutic resistance and metastasis. Breast cancer is also a heterogenous
disease with different subtypes, including HER2+ subtype accounting for about 25% of patients. Despite the
remarkable progress in recent years including anti-HER2 targeted therapy, our understanding of the mechanistic
basis for breast cancer, particularly metastasis is still very limited. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is
to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms of metastasis and therapeutic resistance of HER2+ and
other breast cancers that are ultimately responsible for patient lethality. In the prior funding period, we generated
and analyzed mouse models for HER2+ breast cancer with deletion of an essential autophagy gene FIP200 or
Fip200-4A mutation specifically blocking its autophagy activity and discovered that blocking FIP200-mediated
autophagy abolished mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis through a new mechanism directly regulating the
oncogenic driver HER2 itself. We showed that autophagy blockade abolishes mammary tumorigenesis and
metastasis by decreasing levels of HER2 on the plasma membrane of mouse and human tumor cells due to
aberrant HER2 trafficking from the Golgi to endosomes and multiple vesicular bodies (MVBs) and eventually
released from tumor cells in small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). Additionally, employing single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis, we developed a workflow to determine pharmacological
interventions that would yield similar effects as FIP200 ablation. We also found FIP200 acetylation at K276 by
CBP that regulates its stability. Lastly, we performed an in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 screen of a custom designed
library of autophagy regulatory genes using our unique HER2+ mammary tumor cells and identified p47 as a
putative suppressor for HER2+ breast cancer metastasis. Previous studies showed a role for p47 in regulating
membrane fusion events, autophagy, and NFκB signaling, suggesting potential crosstalk between autophagy
with vesicle trafficking in breast cancer metastasis. Based on these strong preliminary data and using our unique
mouse and cell models, we propose to 1) determine the mechanism of autophagy regulation of HER2 trafficking
in mouse and human breast cancer cells, 2) identify pharmacological agents that can disrupt the functions of
FIP200 in mouse and human breast cancer cells as well as patient-derived models, and 3) explore the role and
mechanisms of regulation of HER2+ breast cancer metastasis by p47. Together, these studies will provide
significant insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of breast cancer metastasis that may contribute
to novel therapies for this devastating disease."

Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) typically results from mutations in the DMD gene that
disrupt the open reading frame, resulting in no dystrophin protein, whereas the milder Becker
muscular dystrophy (BMD) typically results from mutations that allow expression of a partially
functional dystrophin protein. This observation has led to the development of therapies intended
to result in expression of internally-deleted, BMD-like dystrophin proteins. Despite the availability
of four such commercial therapies for a subset of patients, and the transformative promise of
microdystrophin gene therapies that are on the horizon, there are fundamental unanswered
questions about the relationship of partial dystrophin expression to patient function—questions
that bear on our ability to assess the benefits of therapies, to offer prognosis to families, and to
guide approaches to retreatment in gene replacement therapies, among other issues.
Furthermore, it will be critical to understand the distinctions between endogenous, lifelong
expression of partially functional dystrophins, and therapeutic dystrophins delivered postnatally.
Our long-term goal is to understand a fundamental question: How much dystrophin protein—and
what kind of partially functional dystrophin, expressed at what time—is enough? Our objective in
this project is two-fold. First, we seek to understand in finer detail the molecular parameters of
dystrophin expression that result in phenotype amelioration. Second, we seek to develop
methods for full-length dystrophin expression from the endogenous DMD gene, which is a
possibility for a for a subset of patients, and has the potential for improved outcomes in
comparison to microdystrophin. Our central hypothesis is that multiple mechanisms exist to
account for variations in disease severity, and that understanding these mechanisms will lead to
a better understanding of the durability and long-term benefits of dystrophin restoration therapies.
Our rationale is that a detailed exploration of these mechanisms will lead to a better understanding
of the long-term outcomes expected from novel gene therapies for DMD."

Idiopathic transverse myelitis (ITM) is a single autoimmune attack on the spinal cord that leads to weakness,
numbness, and bowel/bladder dysfunction. The incidence is approximately 1-2 per million per year with a
prevalence of approximately 7,500 Americans living with disability from their ITM today. There is are two peak
age distributions with onsets in the teenage years and in adulthood. Men and women are equally affected.
Treatment involves immunosuppression at the time of the attack but neurologic disability persists in greater
than two thirds of cases.
ITM is conventionally viewed as a sporadic disease, with no strong familial risk factors and no recognized
genetic contribution to risk. Recently, we encountered a family of Polish origin with two sisters affected by ITM,
one presenting at age 15 and one presenting at age 50. This unusual occurrence prompted us to seek a
genetic basis for ITM. Genetic sequencing of these sisters revealed that they both harbor a very rare mutation
in a gene called Vacuolar Protein Sorting-Associated Protein 37A (VPS37A). VPS37A is a component of the
endosomal sorting complex required for transport I (ESCRT-1) complex, which is involved in recycling proteins.
This genetic mutation is exceedingly rare in human populations, but among a group 86 ITM patients we
discovered a third patient of Irish/Scottish origin who harbored the same VPS37A genetic mutation. Our results
strongly implicate VPS37A in the cause of ITM and suggest that familial forms of ITM has a genetic
component.
The goals of this proposal are to understand how a genetic mutation in VPS37A causes ITM. Specifically, we
will focus on how this genetic mutation leads to a predisposition to develop an immune mediated attack of the
spinal cord."
10892917,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION/ABSTRACT
 Therapeutically resistant triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by mesenchymal features that
facilitate immune evasion and disease progression, resulting in high rates of death from the disease. New
strategies targeting the mesenchymal phenotype to overcome therapeutic resistance are needed. Interactions
between the cytoskeleton of cancer cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix play important roles in initiating
local invasion and metastasis. The resulting mechanical stimuli activate signaling pathways which promote the
transition of non-motile polarized epithelial cells to cells with mesenchymal properties that are able to invade
surrounding tissues and evade immune surveillance, a process termed epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Fibrotic stiffening of the non-cellular stroma resulting from extracellular matrix deposition is a common
feature of TNBC and other malignancies that is associated with therapeutic resistance and poor prognosis. How
mechanical stress promotes EMT and cancer progression has not been elucidated.
 Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated and Rad-3 Related (ATR) is best known as a regulator of the DNA damage
response in replicating cells. In our preliminary data, we have found that high ATR protein expression is
associated with reduced progression-free survival in TNBC. We discovered that ATR is post-translationally
upregulated by a deubiquitinating enzyme, USP21, in response to mechanical stress, and that ATR regulates
the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex to promote β-catenin nuclear translocation and
mechanical stress-induced EMT. This new role for ATR in mechanical stress and EMT is independent of ATR’s
established function in regulating the DNA damage response. In a clinical trial of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy for
advanced TNBC, high ATR levels in biopsy specimens was correlated with EMT and reduced responsiveness.
ATR inhibition could promote mesenchymal to epithelial transition and anti-tumor immunity in vivo. We
hypothesize that ATR regulates the LINC complex following mechanical stress to promote β-catenin mediated
EMT, immune evasion, and TNBC progression. We will test this hypothesis through three specific aims. Aim 1
will examine the impact of mechanical stress on ATR deubiquitination and the LINC complex; Aim 2 will evaluate
how ATR influences β-catenin pathway activation and EMT; Aim 3 will investigate the role of ATR-SUN2 in
stiffness and EMT associated immune evasion."

As a central controller of cancer growth and metabolism, mTORC1 pathway is commonly mutated and activated
in human cancer, leading to uncontrolled growth. Cancer cells are ‘addicted’ to elevated mTORC1 signaling,
rendering mTORC1 a desirable cancer drug target. The highly specific mTORC1 inhibitors rapamycin analogs
(rapalogs, e.g. temsirolimus) are US FDA-approved oncology drugs. However, their clinical response has been
moderate, which is in a large part due to incomplete understanding of mTORC1 signaling mechanisms
underpinning rapamycin action. In this application, we will test the central hypothesis that nuclear mTORC1
signaling promotes aerobic glycolysis, or Warburg Effect, through a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1-
dependent mechanism, which is important for mTORC1-driven tumorigenesis and rapamycin response. A
successful completion of this project will provide a deeper understanding of this oncogenic pathway and
therapeutic response to its blockage."
10833671,"More than one-quarter of U.S. adults report past-year binge drinking and 5.6% meet criteria for a past-year
alcohol use disorder (AUD). These traits are associated with psychosocial disruption, medical co-morbidities,
and nearly 10% of all U.S. deaths annually. Alcohol consumption and AUD have an estimated twin heritability
of 43% and 49%, respectively. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits have identified 380
genome-wide significant SNPs in 155 loci. In this revised application, we propose to use a “variant to gene
mapping to clinical impact” approach, intersecting GWAS data with ATAC-seq and high-resolution promoter-
focused Capture C neuronal datasets derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to identify
potential effector genes. To prioritize SNPs, we will focus on those residing in open chromatin and with
enhancer epigenetic marks; we will also use eQTL resources, as needed. We will validate these and newly
identified candidates in three ways: 1) in established Drosophila models of alcohol behavioral effects, 2) initially
with human iPSC-derived cortical and dopaminergic neurons and subsequently with neurons of other
neurotransmitter systems, as indicated, to delete the genomic neighborhood harboring a putative causal
variant to determine its effects on the gene's expression, and 3) with data from 4 biobanks to corroborate the
association of the functionally validated genes with alcohol-related phenotypes. In Aim 1, we will expand our
preliminary set of 43 loci from iPSC-derived cortical neurons, initially by applying similar methods to iPSC-
derived dopaminergic neurons and other neuronal types, as indicated. In Aim 2a, we will screen candidate
genes identified in preliminary findings and those identified in Aim 1 by knocking down or over-expressing their
orthologs in fly models of alcohol consumption, preference, sensitivity, and tolerance. In Aim 2b, we will use
SNP-CRISPR in human iPSC-derived neurons to test whether deleting the genomic neighborhood of putative
causal variants from preliminary data or those identified in Aim 1 affects expression of their target gene(s). In
Aim 3, we will use array and exome sequence data from both European- and African-ancestry individuals to
validate all putative effector genes by examining their association with alcohol-related traits, conducting
downstream analyses, testing rare variant effects, and examining pleiotropy in phenome-wide association
studies. This project will identify novel genetic variants and the corresponding effector genes that contribute to
alcohol-related traits, thereby shedding light on the biological pathways that influence the development of the
traits. Study results will have fundamental implications for novel approaches to the diagnosis, prevention, and
treatment of heavy drinking and AUD."
10827964,"SUMMARY
Although many biomarkers have been identified in AD/ADRD, the most important effect is cognitive function.
Links between AD/ADRD symptoms and cerebral blood flow deficits or vascular risk factors such as hypertension
are well recognized in patients, but the mechanisms are still under investigation. In mouse models of AD about
2% of capillaries are occluded by an arrested neutrophil and these stalled capillaries have a profound effect on
cerebral blood flow. Such capillary stall perfusion deficits (CSPD) could reduce oxygenation and nutrient delivery
to neurons and are therefore potential drivers of cognitive dysfunction in AD/ADRD. In AD mouse models,
working memory performance is rescued within hours of reducing the incidence of stalled capillaries to increase
cerebral blood flow using antibodies against the neutrophil protein Ly6G. CSPD has also been observed in a
new non-amyloid ADRD model, hypertensive mice with targeted replacement of the murine ApoE gene with the
AD-promoting ApoE4 human allele. In this mouse, rapid rescue of behavior and flow are observed after treatment
with the platelet inhibitor prasugrel, suggesting a different cellular cause of CSPD than that observed in the AD
models. The rapid time scales of cognitive recovery are too fast for many pathological processes and rule out
vascular or neural remodeling. Instead, the speed of memory improvement suggests that changes in the dynamic
firing pattern of neurons underlie the rescue and that improved metabolic support by increased cerebral blood
flow is a critical factor in determining the functionality of neural circuits. This suggests that slower processes such
as protein accumulation and remodeling can be secondary to fast effects linked to improvement of oxygen and
metabolite delivery after blood flow increase. This proposal tests the idea that cerebral blood flow recovery leads
to corrections in blood oxygenation and in oxygen usage, which then result in metabolic and cellular functional
recovery in neurons (Aim 1). Such metabolic changes are hypothesized to underly corrections of aberrant neural
activity that ultimately determine behavior. Aim 1 will use gamma oscillations, coordinated neural activity
associated with healthy cortical function, as a simultaneous measure of the consequence of the oxygenation
changes. In AD mouse models, an imbalance in the activity of inhibitory and excitatory neurons results in reduced
fidelity of neural encoding of stimuli. Aim 2 asks if the blood flow improvement also corrects this activity imbalance
and improves the precision of stimulus encoding for orientation tuned neurons in visual cortex. Aim 3 tests for
normalization of activity in hippocampal circuits involved in the formation and consolidation of memory, directly
testing the neural circuits involved in the memory tasks that CSPD reduction improves performance in. Age and
sex dependence of these phenomena are investigated in the APP/PS1 model of AD and this study also compares
to a new ApoE4-hypertension model and wild type animals with bead injections to mimic capillary stalls.
Understanding the mechanism of the rapid improvement in memory function after eliminating CSPD could lead
to future therapies that modulate the cognitive symptoms in AD/ADRDs."

We propose to improve risk assessment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a major lethal cancer
for which no early detection strategy exists. We hypothesize that a novel enhanced multifactor risk score
(eMRS) will improve risk stratification for moderate to high genetic risk strata for PDAC, by incorporating carrier
status of hereditary cancer syndrome pathogenic variants. We will develop a new eMRS using large Mayo
Clinic datasets of PDAC cases recruited since 2002 and primary care controls in the Mayo Clinic Biobank with
recently completed whole exome sequencing (WES) by Regeneron Genetics Center (RGC) to first assess the
limited number of existing published models. We will then construct our eMRS with these data and perform
independent validation using the UK Biobank. We will test the value of the model in a dataset of at-risk first-
degree relatives (FDRs) of Mayo Clinic PDAC patients. Our new eMRS for PDAC will for the first time
comprehensively accommodate inherited cancer syndrome pathogenic variants to stratify risk of PDAC in
identically processed sequencing and informatics workflows. The study team includes leaders in gene
identification and genetic epidemiology of PDAC, having led the GWAS that identified the risk SNPs that will be
included in risk model testing and development. By leveraging the three existing major genomic datasets and
one family dataset with accompanying epidemiologic and disease covariates, our specific aims are: (1) To use
uniquely coordinated datasets on Mayo Clinic PDAC cases and Mayo Biobank controls to validate published
polygenic risk score (PRS) and MRS models. We will assemble and analyze Mayo Clinic’s 4,552 prospectively
recruited cases and 53,229 controls to evaluate the heretofore unvalidated models. (2) To build and validate a
novel, enhanced eMRS for PDAC that incorporates cancer germline pathogenic variants. (2a) We will use the
datasets built for cases and controls in Aim 1 and include additional epidemiologic risk factors and germline
pathogenic variant status for hereditary cancer genes, which have not been previously available in public
datasets. (2b) We will validate our new eMRS with an independent dataset of genotype and risk factor data
extracted from 2,371 PDAC cases and the remaining 497,629 non-PDAC UK Biobank participants whose
germline DNA will have also been sequenced by RGC. (3) To determine the extent that PRS, MRS or eMRS
can further refine PDAC risk in first degree relatives of PDAC cases. We will compare standardized incidence
ratios (SIRs) in a dataset of personal cancer histories of 23,739 relatives assembled from Mayo Clinic PDAC
cases’ family history questionnaires to quantify and assess impact. This project will result in several useful
genetic risk stratification models to provide more precise risk assessment for PDAC. The results are
anticipated to have a translational impact on risk assessment, genetic counseling, and early detection of PDAC
through better, potentially targeted, identification of individuals at increased risk who in the future could be
offered minimally invasive surveillance or other options for early-stage detection and prevention."

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an aggressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is
characterized by hepatic lipid buildup, liver damage, inflammation, and fibrosis. The prevalence of NASH has
skyrocketed during the past decade, making it the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality
worldwide and a primary reason for liver transplantation. Dietary obesity, the trigger of NAFLD, induces
excessive lipid accumulation in the liver, causing hepatocyte death and subsequent release of host-derived
damage-associated molecular patterns that in turn activate liver macrophage to ignite hepatic inflammation. Such
inflammation is featured by chronic production of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF, IL-6, and IL-1b.
Several landmark studies in the past decade have collectively shown that chronic liver inflammation is the key
switch mediating simple steatosis transition into NASH. However, how dietary obesity promotes the
establishment of chronic inflammation in the liver remains elusive. Recently, multiple single-cell transcriptomic
studies revealed the emergence of a triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cell 2 (TREM2)-expressing
macrophage population that is highly enriched in patients with NASH, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
To study the role of macrophage TREM2 in NASH pathogenesis, we generated myeloid cell-specific Trem2
knockout mice and subjected them to a western diet-induced NASH model. We discovered that macrophage
TREM2 protects mice against NASH development. Of note, we unexpectedly found that despite its mRNA being
continuously upregulated throughout NASH progression, TREM2 protein only increases in simple steatosis but
almost gets eliminated at NASH. We further demonstrated that the dramatic decline of TREM2 protein in NASH
is due to proteolytic cleavage of full-length TREM2 present on macrophage surface. The overall objective of this
proposal is to comprehensively investigate (1) how TREM2 expression is regulated during NASH pathogenic
progression, (2) what TREM2 does in macrophages to restrict NASH development, and (3) whether blocking
TREM2 cleavage can inhibit NASH progression. To achieve this goal, we will pursue the following three specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will decipher the molecular mechanism by which TREM2 is dynamically regulated during
NASH progression. Specifically, we will identify key signaling pathways responsible for TREM2 up- and down-
regulation at simple steatosis and NASH stages, respectively. In Aim 2, we will test whether TREM2 plays a key
role in macrophage efferocytosis of lipid-laden apoptotic hepatocytes and thereby restrict chronic liver
inflammation and NASH development. Lastly, in Aim 3, by utilizing a cleavage-resistant Trem2 knock-in (Trem2-
IPD) mice, we will perform a proof-of-concept in vivo test to determine if blocking TREM2 cleavage to restore
macrophage efferocytosis can inhibit NASH. Completion of this study will not only provide much-needed
mechanistic insights explaining how prolonged hypernutrition results in chronic liver inflammation, but also will
establish a concrete foundation for designing anti TREM2 cleavage approaches to treat NASH."

The grant “TR2 nuclear receptor in vitamin A signaling” (since 08/01/99) was initiated from studying retinoic
acid (RA) signaling using an embryonic stem cell-specific orphan receptor TR2’s (NR2C1) as a model to
understand RA’s action in developmental regulation. The long-term goal is to comprehensively understand RA
signaling pathways in health and diseases. Results first established RA’s activity in chromatin-remodeling via
RA receptors (RARs), Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and TR2. In 2008, we reported a then-mysterious effect of
RA that did not involve RAR/RXR - it occurred rapidly in the cytoplasm to modulate ERK signaling, and thus
was proposed as “non-canonical”. Previous proposal (05/1/2017-04/30/2022) aimed to i) identify the mediator
of this non-canonical activity of RA in modulating ERK signaling and synthetic RA-like ligands specific to this
pathway, and ii) determine the physiological relevance. Results (published in 14 papers) have established
Cellular Retinoic Acid Binding Protein 1 (CRABP1) as the mediator, characterized RA-CRABP1-RAF-MEK-
ERK signaling pathway and CRABP1 ligands specific to this pathway, and revealed physiological relevance in
maintaining neuron stem cell pool, adiposity and inflammation, all involving CRABP1-ERK regulation. Recently,
a second signaling pathway also directly modulated by CRABP1 was uncovered, calcium/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), but in a different physiological context - excitable cells requiring tight
regulation of CaMKII such as motor neurons (MNs) and cardiomyocytes. The principal hypothesis is, RA-
CRABP1 signalosomes form in specific cellular environments to provide timely (rapid) modulatory
mechanisms ensuring homeostatic propagation of intracellular signals that are critical to the
survival/function of the cells. Pertinent to CRABP1-CaMKII, our recent data show that CRABP1 is highly
expressed in MNs, and CRABP1 knockout (CKO) mice spontaneously develop age-dependent motor deficit
resembling motor symptoms of MN degenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), preceded by
morphological, structural, and functional deterioration of MNs and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). We thus
engineered a sequenced MN-muscle co-differentiation system on custom-fabricated Hydrogel to generate an
in vitro, functional 3D NMJ model for molecular studies. Two aims are to i) dissect molecular mechanisms
of RA-CRABP1-CaMKII signalsome action in NMJ and identify CRABP1 ligands specific to this
pathway, and ii) determine the physiological action of RA-CRABP1-CaMKII signaling and its disease
relevance/therapeutic applications. Aim 1 will employ engineered 3D NMJ model to dissect physiologically
relevant signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms. Aim 2 will distinguish “non-canonical” from
“canonical” activity of RA by comparing CRABP1 ligands and RA in maintaining healthy NMJs, and determine
the therapeutic potential of targeting CRABP1 to improve motor function."

 Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation are leading causes of cardiac arrest, dizziness,
syncope and hospitalization in the United States and worldwide. However, the management of patients
at risk for VT remains suboptimal despite scientific discoveries from basic to population science. In
particular, there is no framework to estimate which patients with VT are likely to respond to anti-
arrhythmic medications or ablation. Therapy is thus empirical. There is great excitement to use analysis
of “big data” to personalize VT therapy, but this has not yet improved outcomes.
 This project develops a novel computational approach to personalize VT therapy that combines
machine learning in large registries with computational models. Machine learning will be applied to data
across biological scales that span bedside, laboratory and non-invasive imaging, to predict which
patients are likely to respond to therapy. Computer models will be used to estimate if a given patient's
heart is likely to support VT before versus after therapy. We will validate results in large external
registries from different Institutions. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To develop a computational pipeline to
predict response to VT ablation using bedside, laboratory and non-invasive imaging; (2) To use machine
learning of clinical data and non-invasive imaging to identify which patients with VT will respond to anti-
arrhythmic medications in a large database; (3) To combine computational approaches to estimate the
relative likelihood that a given patient will respond to various forms of therapy. Results from each Aim will
be tested in independent external registries. We will probe computational models to identify clinical
phenotypes that could be applied at the bedside.
 This project will provide immediate clinical impact for patients with VT. We will combine machine
learning with physics-based computer models in large registries at Stanford and External centers. We will
reduce computational bias using FAIR methods (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable),
and make tools freely available per the 2018 NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Our team comprises
experts in clinical and basic electrophysiology, imaging, machine learning, bioengineering and statistics.
The project is very feasible."

It is estimated that human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for 42,700 cancers in the US each year and that
it caused more than 90% of anal and cervical cancers and about 70% of oropharyngeal, vaginal, and vulvar
cancers. The increases in incidences of HPV-associated anal and oropharyngeal cancers in the US are
notable, and cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women globally. This is the second
competitive renewal of this R01, which has the long-term goal of developing therapeutic vaccines for HPV. This
is significant because currently available prophylactic vaccines are effective only for preventing HPV infections,
but not for eliminating them once they are established. The estimated lifetime probably of acquiring HPV is
91.3% for men and 84.6% for women. We developed and are testing PepCan, a therapeutic vaccine that
consists of four “current good manufacturing grade” synthetic peptides that cover the E6 protein of HPV type
16 (HPV 16), along with a Candida skin-test reagent as a novel vaccine adjuvant. Our dose-escalation single-
site Phase I clinical trial of PepCan to treat women with cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions
(HSILs) was recently completed. It demonstrated safety, a significant decrease in HPV 16 viral load, and a
significant increase in circulating T-helper type 1 cells after vaccination. A randomized (to two treatment arms),
double-blind, Phase II clinical trial is on track to complete recruitment soon. Furthermore, in a double-blind,
placebo-controlled (3:1 ratio) Phase I/II clinical trial, PepCan is being tested to reduce recurrence of squamous
cell carcinoma of head and neck in patients who reach “no evidence of disease” status after curative treatment.
The following aims will test our hypothesis that PepCan induces HPV-specific immune responses, resulting in
reduced recurrence of head and neck cancer (HNC) and increased regression of HSILs when the effector cells
(i.e., T-cells) reach the disease sites.
 Aim 1: Assess efficacy and safety of our HPV therapeutic vaccine for HNC recurrence reduction
 and cervical HSIL regression
 Aim 2: Examine immune factors that influence PepCan response and vaccine mechanisms
 Aim 3: Examine how microbiomes of gut and of disease sites (cervix and mouth) contribute to
 vaccine efficacy
Results of the proposed investigations may lead to FDA approval of a therapeutic vaccine for two HPV-related
cancers and to an improved understanding of immunotherapy mechanisms."
10908524,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Right heart failure (RHF) is the leading cause of mortality in people with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and
the sequence of events leading to this suboptimal outcome begins with pulmonary regurgitation (PR) and right
heart (RH) remodeling. Arrhythmias and impaired aerobic capacity are the most common presentations prior to
the onset of RHF, but performing pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) after the onset of these symptoms is not
associated with improved outcomes. Recent data show that elevated right atrial pressure (RA hypertension),
as estimated by echocardiographic assessment of inferior vena cava (IVC) size and collapsibility (IVC hemo-
dynamics), precedes the onset of arrhythmias and impaired aerobic capacity in TOF patients, and it is associ-
ated with accelerated RH remodeling, symptomatic deterioration and mortality in this population. However, the
mechanism linking RA hypertension, RH remodeling and symptomatic deterioration, and the extent to which
performing PVR prior to the onset of RA hypertension improves clinical outcomes are unknown. The long-term
goal is to prevent premature cardiovascular deaths in TOF patients by modifying the risk factors for mortality.
The overall objective is to delineate the pathophysiologic mechanism linking RA hypertension, RH remodeling
and onset of symptoms such as arrhythmias and impaired aerobic capacity, since symptomatic status is a risk
factor for mortality in the TOF population. Our central hypothesis is that RA hypertension leads to accelerated
RH remodeling and onset of symptoms (arrhythmias and impaired aerobic capacity), and that performing PVR
prior to onset of RA hypertension is associated with RH reverse remodeling and improvement of symptoms.
This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: (1) Determine the mechanism linking RA hyper-
tension (assessed by IVC hemodynamics), RH remodeling and onset of symptoms (arrhythmias and impaired
aerobic capacity) in TOF patients with moderate-severe PR; (2) Determine the extent to which performing PVR
prior to the onset of RA hypertension is associated with RH reverse remodeling (improvement of imaging and
biomarker indices of RH remodeling) and improvement of symptoms (less arrhythmias and improved aerobic
capacity). Under the first aim, 150 asymptomatic subjects (75 in each arm) will undergo imaging, laboratory
blood tests, exercise test, and patient reported quality of assessment at baseline, 12 months and 24 months.
Under the second aim, 120 subjects (60 in each arm) undergoing PVR for clinical indications will be enrolled to
undergo multi-domain assessments at baseline (prior to PVR), 12 months and 24 months similar to the first
aim. This proposal is innovative because it will delineate the mechanisms responsible for symptomatic deterio-
ration, and the impact of PVR on these mechanisms. The results will be significant because it will set the stage
for future clinical trials to test the survival benefits of PVR performed at different stages of disease pathogene-
sis, and development of novel therapies for the prevention and early treatment of RHF."

Post-translational changes in the redox state of cysteine residues can rapidly and reversibly alter protein function,
modulating biological processes and drug pharmacology. During the last funding period, our lab reported several
innovations in organosulfur chemistry, small-molecule tools, and computational methods for proteomic analysis
that dramatically improved selectivity, cellular application, and site-specific quantitation of the cysteine redoxome
(J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2017; Nat. Chem. Biol., 2018; Nat. Chem., 2021; Nat. Comm., 2022). Application of these
chemoproteomic methods has contributed to meaningful discovery of new paradigms in redox biology (Nat. Cell
Biol., 2019; Cell Metab., 2019; Blood Adv., 2020; Nat. Comm., 2021; Redox Biol., 2021 & 2022; Proc. Natl. Acad.
Sci., 2022) and raise interesting new questions about the links between the cellular redox landscape, molecular
thiol-based redox switches, and the emerging field of redox medicine. Herein, the following three Specific Aims
are proposed: Development and application of 1) chemical methods to address spatiotemporal control in redox
signaling; 2) genetic incorporation of oxidized cysteine in proteins to pinpoint molecular mechanisms underlying
thiol-based redox regulation; and 3) nucleophile-fragment libraries to discover covalent ligands that target redox-
regulated proteins in the cysteinome. Strong preliminary data demonstrate that studies proposed herein are both
promising and feasible in our hands. Deliverables resulting from these studies include: 1) valuable new chemical
biology approaches to understand fundamental mechanisms in thiol-based redox signaling, and 2) novel chem-
ical matter that can be mined as a source of small-molecule probes and as starting points for drug discovery."

Project 1
Asthma afflicts over 7% of Americans and is the result of chronic inflammation of the airways leading to airway
remodeling and hyperresponsiveness that impedes air flow. Severe asthma is asthma that remains problematic
despite maximal intervention with conventional asthma therapies, and it accounts for the majority of the mortality
and cost of asthma. Dysfunction of airway β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) signaling contributes to severe asthma
pathogenesis, but the precise signaling mechanisms responsible are unclear. While activation of β2AR using
inhaled “β-agonist” drugs is a mainstay of acute asthma treatment, overactivation of β2AR is detrimental and can
be fatal. Airway β2ARs signal both through heterotrimeric G proteins and through G protein-coupled receptor
kinase (GRK)/β-arrestin pathways that also mediate receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and
internalization. Through a long-standing collaboration, the Stamler and Gaston groups have found that airways
are regulated by nitric oxide (NO) through S-nitrosylation of thiols to form S-nitrosothiol (SNO), including on
cysteine residues in proteins, a post-translational modification that alters protein functions. In addition, SNO
forms on low molecular weight thiols, including glutathione to form SNO-glutathione (GSNO). We demonstrated
that inhaled GSNO elevates lung protein-SNO and is protective in asthma, identified the enzyme SNO-
glutathione reductase (GSNOR) that inactivates GSNO, and demonstrated that mice lacking GSNOR are
protected from developing asthma. Since the β2AR can activate NO synthase in the airways to generate NO,
there is a need to discover how this promotes endogenous SNO-mediated bronchoprotection. Our recent work
has shown that β2AR is S-nitrosylated after activation, and preventing SNO-β2AR with a point mutation augments
β2AR signaling. Importantly, mice bearing β2AR with a knock-in of this mutation are protected from developing
asthma. We have previously shown that β2AR regulators GRK2 and β-arrestin2 are S-nitrosylated to inhibit their
activity to desensitize the β2AR, and mice bearing GRK2-C340S and β-arrestin2-C253S knock-in exhibit heighted
β2AR activity and worsened injury in cardiac models. We have begun to test the efficacy of inhaled GSNO to
affect bronchorelaxation and improved lung function in patients, and these data and clinical samples uniquely
position us to examine the role of S-nitrosylation in regulating the β2AR pathway from bench to bedside. The
Central Hypothesis of Project 1 is that the β2AR signaling system is a key target and mediator of SNO-GSNO-
GSNOR protective effects in the airways in severe asthma. Our studies will define the role of S-nitrosylation of
specific β2AR signaling pathway components in a murine model of asthma, delineate the roles of inhaled GSNO
and of GSNO dinitrosylases on β2AR signaling components in murine models of asthma and in human lung
primary cells, and demonstrate that inhaled GSNO improves both airway flow and β2-agonist responsiveness in
severe asthma. This work complements the clinical aims in Projects 2 and 3 by providing a mechanistic link
between NO/GSNO/GSNOR actions and the regulation of β2AR signaling in severe asthma."

 In Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) autoreactive CD4 T cells mediate the destruction of insulin producing beta-cells.
The reasons for this misguided attack are poorly understood. Post-translational protein modifications could
provide plausible explanations for the existence of autoreactive T cells in T1D. Hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs)
are a form of post translationally modified antigens that form in beta-cells through the covalent ligation between
proinsulin fragments and other beta-cell peptides. The resulting HIPs contain non-genomic amino acid
sequences making them plausible targets for pathogenic T cells in T1D. Various HIP-reactive CD4 T cell clones
were shown to trigger diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a major animal model for the study of T1D.
In addition, HIP-reactive CD4 T cells were identified in residual pancreatic islets of T1D organ donors.
Significantly elevated levels of HIP-reactive T cells were also be detected in the peripheral blood of recent-onset
T1D patients, but not in non-diabetic control subjects. Importantly, we applied mass spectrometric analyses on
islets and confidently validated the presence of several HIPs that participate in T1D pathogenies. Autophagy is
a cellular mechanism that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components of the cell through lysosomal
degradation. Our data indicate that autophagy plays a critical role on HIP-content in islets. Here we propose to
modulate autophagy in human islets through various mechanisms, including cytokine treatment, with the
objective to increase cellular HIP content. This will facilitate our identification efforts of novel HIP through mass
spectrometric analyses on islets. We will also study the role of metabolic stress that may lead to the accumulation
of a new sub-group of HIPs in beta-cells that could provide a trigger for T1D. Furthermore, we will study the
mechanism of HIP-formation in human islets. Understanding this mechanism may provide us with new
therapeutic targets that could be used to block HIP-formation in beta-cells and remove epitopes for disease-
driving T cells in T1D. Additionally, we will use ELISPOT analyses to establish the role of identified HIPs as T
cell epitopes in T1D pathogenesis. Such HIP-reactive T cells could serve as T1D biomarkers and allow us to
improve current disease-prediction models. Lastly, we will advance and benchmark an innovative computer
algorithm for the mass spectrometric identification of hybrid and native peptides. This algorithm may allow us to
identify other types of hybrid peptides that cannot be discovered through conventional methodologies. In
summary, success in this project will deliver new technologies, biomarkers, and therapeutic targets for the study
and prevention of T1D. Identification of novel HIPs will also deliver targets for the induction of antigen specific
tolerance induction in T1D, which may be required for the reversal of T1D."

The first year after cancer treatment ends is a critical time to establish survivorship care for young adult (YA)
cancer survivors ages 26 to 39. Receipt of evidence-based survivorship care, including surveillance for cancer
recurrence based on national guidelines, remain low among YA survivors. At the same time, YAs ages 26 to
39 have the highest rate of both uninsurance and underinsurance among US adults. Our team’s prior work
demonstrated that YA cancer survivors report low understanding of their health insurance and the services it
covers, which affects their ability to navigate care. Together, these issues can lead to significant access to care
barriers and severe medical cost consequences for this population. This proposal addresses the urgent need
to improve YA cancer survivors’ health insurance literacy and decrease financial toxicity, thus improving their
ability to receive recommended survivorship care. Guided by Andersen and Aday’s Behavioral Model of Health
Services Use, we developed and pilot-tested a 4-session virtual patient navigation intervention for YA cancer
survivors that was adapted from a pilot program for childhood cancer survivors. Initial results support feasibility,
acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of both of these pilot trials with YA survivors ages 26 to 39. We now
propose a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of this program (“CHAT-S”) to improve health
insurance literacy, financial toxicity due to medical costs, and post-treatment surveillance for recurrence among
YA cancer survivors ages 26 to 39. We plan to randomize N=300 (N=200 intervention; N=100 usual care) YAs
with breast, testicular, lymphoma, sarcoma, and colorectal cancer who have completed initial treatment within
the past year from 14 locations in the University of Utah Healthcare (UUHC) and Intermountain Healthcare (IH)
systems. UUHC and IH have many rural (20%) and Hispanic/Latinx (18%) YA cancer survivors; we will
oversample these important subgroups. We will determine whether CHAT-S improves health insurance literacy
and financial toxicity at 6-month follow-up (primary outcomes). Further, UUHC and IH have an integrated data
infrastructure which allows us to capture electronic health records and claims data to investigate whether
CHAT-S improves surveillance care for recurrence at 18-month follow-up (secondary outcome). We will
explore moderators (e.g., rurality, ethnicity) of the intervention effects. Finally, to inform future dissemination,
we will conduct a budget impact analysis and a short-term and long-term time horizon cost-effectiveness
analysis of CHAT-S. This proposal addresses the National Cancer Institute’s goal of improving the care of
cancer survivors and mitigating financial toxicity. We will demonstrate that a virtual health insurance literacy
intervention can improve insurance literacy, financial toxicity, and surveillance care among YA cancer
survivors, and provide guidance to improving survivorship care across the United States."

Due to the limited ability to mount a regenerative response in injured myocardium, cardiac dysfunction remains
a key cause of morbidity and mortality. Coronary artery disease leads to myocardial infarction which results in
fibrotic scarring, adverse remodeling, and heart failure. In contrast to adult mice and humans, neonatal mice
and adult zebrafish retain the ability to undergo cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation, ultimately
stimulating cardiac regeneration following injury. Deciphering the fundamental transcriptional networks shared
in development and regeneration will fuel our ability to awaken endogenous reparative mechanisms. In zebrafish,
embryonic cardiac transcriptional factors necessary for cardiogenesis, such as Nkx2.5, are galvanized following
injury to stimulate cardiomyocyte production. Our preliminary studies reveal that Fibulin 5, an extracellular matrix
(ECM) glycoprotein functioning downstream of Nkx2.5, is upregulated in the injured heart. Moreover, we show
that fibulin loss-of-function fish exhibit impaired regenerative capacity and crucial roles in migration and tissue
elasticity. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that activation of Nkx2.5 is necessary to produce an ECM
milieu comprise of cardinal pro-regenerative proteins such as Fibulin 5 that can be harnessed to augment cell-
based therapies for patients. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the myriad mechanisms by which Nkx2.5 directs effectors
to mediate deposition and remodeling of ECM elements employing mass spectrometry-based proteomic
strategies. In Aim 2, we postulate that Fibulin 5 modulates TGF-β signaling to promote epicardial invasion and
titrate tissue stiffness. We will dissect both the canonical and non-canonical TGF-β pathways to identify the key
signal transducers downstream of Fibulin 5. Using time lapse imaging of cardiac slices, we will probe the
intertwined movements of epicardial and myocardial cells in real time as they penetrate deep into the wound.
We will benefit from atomic force microscopy to measure elastic modulus in regenerating myocardium to uncover
the requirement of Fibulin 5 in preserving a malleable microenvironment to promote migration. In Aim 3, we will
investigate the premise that Fibulin 5 is a vital component of the regenerative ECM with potential to enhance
scar resolution by evaluating hiPSC-CMs mobility in vitro and host-graft integration in vivo. Together, we
anticipate that our proposed work will launch a novel paradigm highlighting the importance of embryonic ECM
components such as Fibulin 5 downstream of Nkx2-5 in promoting epicardial and cardiomyocyte migration and
tissue elasticity to enhance therapeutic strategies for patients."

Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, affects over 9 million adults in the US annually, with neurologic
conditions, such as stroke and Parkinson’s disease (PD), being the number one cause of the disorder.
Dysphagia in neurologic disease is associated with significant negative outcomes, such as prolonged
hospitalization, respiratory compromise, depression, malnutrition, and mortality. A better understanding of
both the central (neural) and physiological/biomechanical deficits seen in neurogenic dysphagia will enable
better clinical management through improved identification of patients and the development of targeted
and personalized therapeutic interventions. No current tools exist to enable the concurrent 3D visualization
of swallowing physiological/biomechanical events along with the associated functional brain activity that
drives those events. This project will optimize and validate a novel multimodal imaging method and
analysis platform to visualize and quantify both swallowing physiology events and brain function during
swallowing using magnetic resonance imaging. Using a recently-developed framework for fast dynamic
imaging, a technique will be demonstrated and validated that will achieve full 3D imaging of the functional
swallowing anatomy along with imaging of brain function, simultaneously. The resulting method will provide
unprecedented high-spatial and high-temporal resolution images of the dynamic swallowing motions and
the brain activity associated with this critical life-sustaining function and has the potential to offer a new
state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment outcome tool for neurogenic dysphagia. Utilizing the new
multimodal imaging method, we will demonstrate the sensitivity to changes in swallowing function and
neural activity by examining a group of young (aged 18-25 years old) and older (aged 60-85 years old)
healthy adults performing incidental swallows and other oropharyngeal tasks. We will then establish the
preliminary sensitivity of this new approach in identifying phenotypes of neurogenic dysphagia in patients
with stroke and Parkinson’s disease (n=60 for each condition). The technique will enable the determination
of differential dynamic motion and fMRI signatures of dysfunction within and across conditions/diseases.
This line of research will have an important positive impact because it has the potential to improve
neurogenic dysphagia characterization and to provide the foundation to start improving diagnostic
accuracy, prognosis, and treatment of this debilitating condition in the future."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), diagnosed in over 20,000 US citizens each year, has a 5-year survival of only
20-30%. Despite decades of research, the effective treatment of AML remains a significant unmet clinical need,
with standard of care underscored by high relapse and mortality rates due to the persistence of treatment-
resistant leukemic stem cells (LSC) that drive the disease. Work by us and others, and the existence of a large
genomic subgroup represented by mutations in RNA splicing genes, in combination present compelling evidence
to suggest that deregulated control at the level of RNA metabolism is a feature that defines and mediates aspects
of disease pathology. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are core effectors of post-transcriptional regulation that
execute precise control of gene expression by modulating RNA properties that include splicing, polyadenylation,
localization, degradation and translation, and as a class can enforce an extremely diverse network of regulatory
pathways. One specific class of RBPs functions within stress granules, membraneless cytoplasmic structures
that are composed of RBPs and mRNAs to orchestrate post-transcriptional programs mediating adaptive cellular
responses. Through a combination of genetic screens and in vivo studies, we recently discovered that LSCs
selectively depend on the ability to form stress granules for their survival and proliferation. We therefore
hypothesize that stress granules play a critical role in AML pathogenesis and that stress granule proteins
represent a vulnerability that can be exploited in novel targeted therapeutic strategies. In this project, we aim to
define the dynamics and functional requirements for stress granules in the leukemic stem cells of highly treatment
refractory MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) AML. We will first perform a series of in vitro stress granule formation and in
vivo cell engraftment studies assays using acutely isolated MLL-r AML and normal HSCs to identify stress
granule dynamics and characteristics across primitive to more committed AML and normal hematopoietic cells.
We will uncover mRNAs bound selectively in stress granules, define and functionally validate putatively key LSC-
specific stress granule-interacting proteins, including one candidate we have already identified, and map the role
of novel LSC-specific stress granule proteins and RNAs sequestered in them, in LSC function. Lastly, we will
systematically screen for novel stress granule-relevant RBPs that underlie the function of relapsed LSCs. Our
study will thus define the role of stress granule RNA and protein components and the gene expression networks
they control to promote leukemia pathogenesis, thereby identifying novel potential therapeutic targets in AML."

Providing care for persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) comes with significant
physical and psychosocial costs, necessitating interventions to support caregivers’ health and quality of life
(QoL). Yet, effective intervention requires a nuanced understanding of the factors that impact the burden
along the care trajectory. Crucially underexplored in its contribution to caregiver burden is dysphagia
(swallowing impairment), which occurs in up to 93% of persons with ADRD. While our previous work has
demonstrated that dysphagia is an independent predictor of emotional and physical burden across
caregivers of heterogenous populations of older adults, there is currently no standard of care for
incorporating dysphagia education and support, including content and timing, into ADRD-related
interventions. With the goal of integrating proactive dysphagia-related caregiver burden reduction into
standard clinical practices, this proposed Phase 0 research study will address the critical when (timing) and
what (targets) needed for intervention design. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to (a) quantify
dysphagia’s contribution to burden among family caregivers of persons with ADRD across the disease
trajectory (early-, mid-, and late-stage disease), and (b) characterize the moderating effects of caregiver
knowledge, preparedness, competence, and perceived support on dysphagia-related caregiver burden and
care recipient QoL across the dysphagia trajectory (no dysphagia, dysphagia with minimal to no dietary
modifications, and dysphagia with dietary modifications). Using data obtained via self-report and surveys,
moderated multiple regression models will test the relationship between functional measures of dysphagia
status and caregiver burden as well as the role of caregivers’ dysphagia-related knowledge and perceived
preparedness, competence, and social support in moderating the relationship between dysphagia severity
and dysphagia-related burden and QoL. Successful completion of this work will identify additional modifiable
contributors to ADRD-related caregiver burden and potential mechanisms of action. The results will directly
inform the development of a new, evidence-based intervention for reducing aspects of caregiver burden
related to dysphagia management in ADRD and thus offer a unique opportunity to intervene with families
earlier and proactively, ameliorating, and potentially even preventing, the development of these aspects of
burden over time. Ultimately, reducing the burden associated with dysphagia, a highly prevalent
consequence of ADRD, offers a novel and underexplored strategy to promote health and QoL among the
caregivers of and persons with ADRD."
10897837,"Project Summary: The prevalence of food allergies, such as to peanut or egg, is increasing worldwide, with
the number of individuals affected in the US approaching 32 million, ≈10% of the population. For allergic
disease, the current standard of therapy involves administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, and
leukotriene inhibitors that only target allergic symptoms. Therapies such as specific immunotherapy target the
Th2 bias that underlies allergy, however this requires long periods of dose escalation with soluble antigen and
carries a significant risk of adverse reactions. No therapies are currently available to develop tolerance to the
antigens. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a nanoparticle (NP) based platform that can be an
off-the-shelf treatment for induction of tolerance to specific food allergens to inhibit undesired immune
responses, while not affecting the remaining elements of the immune response. Drs. Stephen Miller and
Lonnie Shea (co-PIs) have pioneered an approach that was initially applied to autoimmune disease (Type 1
Diabetes, multiple sclerosis) in which NPs are loaded with antigens, which upon intravenous administration,
induce of tolerance to the antigen. The NP technology has been licensed and recently successfully completed
a Phase 2a study for celiac disease (a Th1 autoimmune disease). With the goal of moving this technology
toward the treatment of allergic diseases, we propose to investigate the NP design for allergic disease. The NP
delivers the antigen to APCs, yet also influences their phenotype and activation of T cells. The NP properties,
such as antigen loading and composition, can influence T cell activation, and we will identify those properties
that can tolerize Th2 responses such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 secretion, B cell activation, and effector cell
responses such as mast cells and basophils, which are distinct from the Th1/17 responses in autoimmune
disease. Notably, the ability to design the physicochemical properties may facilitate translation of the NPs, as
achieving good manufacturing practices and clinical approval while avoiding unanticipated side effects may be
more easily attainable without the incorporation of an API. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the NP design and
modulation of cellular and molecular responses of APCs for the treatment of peanut and egg allergy models,
with Dr. O’Konek (co-I) providing expertise in food allergy. We propose to investigate critical attributes of NPs
to distinguish i) the impact of NP properties on immune cell polarization, ii) the efficacy of antigen presentation,
iii) the in vivo trafficking of the NPs, and iv) the efficacy of tolerance induction in pre-sensitized food allergy
disease models. Specific Aim 2 will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which NP delivery
affects T cell phenotypes while tolerizing Th2 allergic diseases. Furthermore, the frequency, receptor
expression and response of mast cells and basophils to allergen exposure will be measured. This innovative
NP-based approach would identify NPs that are safe, and will connect the NP properties to APC,T cell, and
effector cell responses, and subsequently to the amelioration of allergic disease."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) exacts a disproportionate toll on rural African American communities in the
Southeast. Implementing and scaling a proven-effective, evidence-based program (EBP) is essential to
mitigate growing disparities in CVD risk among rural communities. We previously adapted PREMIER, an EBP,
into Heart Matters and conducted a randomized controlled feasibility trial at seven host sites in two rural
counties in eastern North Carolina (NC), largely populated with African Americans with high CVD burden. As
with PREMIER, systolic blood pressure and self-reported physical activity and dietary behaviors significantly
improved in the intervention arm compared to controls after 6 months. Heart Matters’ success, however, was
dampened by critical implementation barriers at the organizational level, including limited readiness, partial
collaboration between stakeholders, and low organizational efficacy to implement an EBP, which reduced
fidelity and penetration of Heart Matters. To address implementation barriers, our research team will
investigate the implementation and effectiveness of the Heart Matters EBP by scaling to five rural counties in
Eastern NC. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, our overall objective is to
partner with organizations to scale and test Heart Matters implementation to other rural African American
communities, and support translation of evidence to practice in eastern NC. In year 1, we will collaborate with
our longstanding community-academic coalition to identify and recruit eligible organizations from our study
setting (Edgecombe, Franklin, Nash, Vance, and Warren Counties). We will engage organizations (n=60) in
formative research using concept mapping to identify and map contextual implementation factors affecting EBP
implementation in rural African American communities. We will use these findings to refine existing training
protocols and develop an organizational collaborative called “Collaborate and Leverage Evidence in an African
American Rural Network” or Co-LEARN. In year 2, we will identify Co-LEARN sites (n=18) and employ
participatory systems science methods to develop an implementation blueprint through: 1) shared learning
aimed at training and capacity building and 2) shared action planning aimed at continuous quality improvement
of implementation strategy at the site-level. The objective of Co-LEARN is to increase organizational
readiness, strengthen network collaborations, and enhance organizational efficacy to implement a CVD EBP.
In years 3-4, we will employ a hybrid type II implementation effectiveness design to conduct a cluster
randomized controlled trial (n=486). We will evaluate outcomes of implementation (e.g., acceptability, adoption,
penetration), CVD biomarkers (e.g., blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity) and cost effectiveness of
Heart Matters. Our long-term goal is to increase acceptability, adoption, and penetration of CVD EBPs in rural

As the leading cause of cancer death, lung cancer represents the most significant cancer-related public health
challenge in the United States. Although low-dose CT-based screening holds promise for earlier detection,
currently, most lung cancer cases are not diagnosed until advanced stages (III, IV) and have 5-year survival
rates of 21% or less. In contrast to Black-White survival disparities, Hispanic patients have markedly lower
age-adjusted death rates than their non-Hispanic White (NHW) counterparts despite later stage diagnoses and
broader SES and healthcare disparities; these findings are well established and consistent with the “Hispanic
Health Paradox”, a phenomenon characterized by Hispanic advantages in objective health outcomes (e.g.,
mortality) despite significant health and socioeconomic risk factors. The leading explanatory hypothesis
concerns the role of cultural factors facilitating social integration. Social integration is among the most robust
psychosocial predictors of a range of objective health outcomes, including cancer survival. However, no
published work has directly tested this sociocultural hypothesis in relation to Hispanic resilience. Consistent
with the emerging science of resilience, we propose a multisite, two-study, mixed-methods investigation to
evaluate this sociocultural hypothesis. Study 1 is a multisite, longitudinal observational study of 672 Hispanic
and NHW individuals with advanced stage lung cancer sampled from three regions across the U.S. Interviews
using gold-standard and culturally-informed survey measures (demographics, social integration, cultural
values, acculturation) will be conducted in English and Spanish from a centralized coordinating center with a 6-
week follow-up to examine change in perceived support provision/needs. The primary outcome of survival and
secondary outcomes (e.g., treatment adherence), will be gathered from electronic medical records over mean
follow-up time of 33-months. Study 2 is a single-site, 7-day, intensive measurement investigation into the daily
units of social integration that mediate outcomes. Study 2 integrates two novel in vivo sampling methods
(Electronically Activated Recorder [EAR] and ecological momentary assessments [EMA]) using a mobile phone
platform. The current aims are to (1) investigate whether the observed Hispanic survival advantage is mediated
by ethnic differences in social integration among recently diagnosed late-stage lung cancer patients and (2) to
examine the processes/mechanisms that underlie these relationships in daily life including the role of
individual, family, network, and neighborhood-level factors. The highly experienced investigator team includes
leaders in all relevant content areas, including the Hispanic health paradox, lung cancer survivorship, social
integration, and ecological sampling methodologies. The results will contribute to better understanding of social
processes among cancer patients, inform psychosocial interventions based on social integration, and
contribute to the emerging science of health resilience as well as racial/ethnic and cultural variations in health
outcomes."

Mutations in genes encoding nuclear envelope (NE) components cause an array of diseases referred to as
nuclear envelopathies that often manifest as cardiomyopathies. The NE separates the nucleoplasm from
cytoplasm and is composed of outer and inner nuclear membranes. The nuclear lamina (NL) is an extensive
network of lamin polymers and associated proteins that are embedded in the inner nuclear membrane (INM).
Functionally, NL and INM proteins not only provide mechanical stability to the nucleus but also serve as the
anchoring point for chromatin at the nuclear periphery, playing a critical role in chromatin organization and
regulation of gene expression via interaction with and modulation of epigenetic machinery components. The
LAP2-Emerin-MAN1-domain (LEM-D) family of proteins play an important role in the association between the
NL and chromatin. LEMD2 (LEM domain-containing protein 2), is a transmembrane protein located in the INM,
involved in nuclear integrity and perinuclear tethering and transcriptional silencing of heterochromatin.
Recently, it has been reported that a single amino acid substitution of leucine 13 to arginine (L13R) in LEMD2
leads to autosomal recessive human cardiomyopathy. However, despite its clinical relevance, little is known as
to the specific role of LEMD2 in cardiomyocytes (CMs), and mechanisms by which the L13R mutation leads to
cardiomyopathy. To address this gap in knowledge, we have generated three mouse models: constitutive CM-
specific Lemd2 knockout (cKO), inducible CM-specific Lemd2 knockout (icKO), and LEMD2 L13R knock-in
mice. We will also utilize a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived CM model of the LEMD2 L13R
mutation to address the impact of L13R mutation in LEMD2 on human CMs. Preliminary studies revealed that
loss of LEMD2 in embryonic or adult CMs is detrimental, and LEMD2 L13R mutation affects cardiac function in
a murine model, indicating that LEMD2 plays a critical role in maintaining normal CM structure and function in
developing and adult hearts. Thus, we hypothesize that LEMD2-mediated maintenance of NE integrity and/or
regulation of heterochromatin tethering and silencing is essential for CM structure and function, and LEMD2
L13R mutation impairs specific aspects of LEMD2 function leading to cardiomyopathy. Accordingly, Our
Specific Aims are: 1. To determine the role of LEMD2 in the developing and adult myocardium by analyzing
constitutive (cKO) and inducible (icKO) Lemd2 CM-specific knockout mice for heart morphogenesis, structure
and function, and the progression of cardiomyopathy; and 2. To elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying
cardiomyopathy consequent to the L13R mutation in LEMD2 by detailed analyses of LEMD2 L13R knock-in
mice and human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived LEMD2 L13R mutant CMs."

The interleukin 1 (IL-1) cytokine superfamily member IL-33 drives host protection against gastrointestinal (GI)
pathogens through mechanisms that remain unclear. Paradoxically, IL-33 responsiveness in different
lymphocyte subsets dictates its pro- vs. anti-inflammatory roles evinced by its ability to promote expansion of
group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) or Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), respectively. Whether source of IL-33
influences its biological role has been largely ignored due the current paradigm that IL-33 is only released from
damaged structural cells (e.g. epithelial cell lineages). However, our recently published data show that intestinal
epithelial cell (IEC)-derived IL-33 drives ILC2 responses and GI helminth immunity, whereas dendritic cell (DC)-
derived IL-33 drives ST2+Foxp3+ Treg responses and helminth susceptibility. This proposal seeks to understand
the mechanisms responsible for IL-33 expression and production in the myeloid lineage and further investigates
whether IL-33 cellular context controls the balance between inflammation vs. immunosuppression during
protozoan infections as it does in helminth infections. Our project tests the central hypothesis that cellular
source of IL-33 determines whether IL-33 serves a protective or pathogenic role during GI parasite
infection through controlling intestinal Treg subset expansion. We will test this hypothesis in two specific
aims (SA). Experiments proposed in SA1 will: a) transcriptionally profile IL-33+ vs. IL-33- DC to determine whether
IL-33 expressing APC constitute a distinct subset, b) employ microscopy and imaging mass spectrometry to
understand the tissue niches where these cells reside, and c) determine whether DC-derived IL-33 is critical for
the maintenance and/or induction of distinct subsets of Foxp3+ Treg through microbial-dependent mechanisms.
SA2 will generate mice that allow IL-33 deletion in distinct DC-subsets and tissue macrophage populations to
determine their impact on intestinal tissue homeostasis and host protection against GI pathogens. Lastly, we will
determine whether epithelial vs. myeloid derived-IL-33 controls microbial dysbiosis and the pathological outcome
following oral Toxoplasma gondii infection. Taken together, this project seeks to expand the basic understanding
of how the cellular context of cytokine production impacts immunity against important human GI pathogens."

Endometriosis affects 1 in 10 women of reproductive age and is associated with chronic pelvic pain and
infertility. The disease is characterized by the presence of abnormal endometrial tissue at sites outside the
uterus. Current treatment options for endometriosis are limited to surgery, hormone therapy and pain
management. There is an unmet need for non-hormonal treatment options that specifically target abnormal
endometrial tissue. Retrograde menstruation promotes the spread of endometrial tissue from the uterus to
ectopic sites within the peritoneal cavity. Although retrograde menstruation plays a role in the establishment of
the disease, additional factors are necessary for endometriosis development. Understanding how displaced
endometrial cells cause the disease requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that allow
endometrial cells to invade, survive and colonize ectopic sites. The recent identification of recurrent ARID1A
mutations in endometriotic lesions supports a causal role for epigenetic dysregulation in endometriosis
development. We hypothesize that epigenetic dysregulation predisposes displaced endometrial cells to
endometriosis by promoting the aberrant expression of genes and pathways necessary for endometrial cell
invasion and survival. In this study, we will utilize innovative model systems and advanced `omics technologies
to investigate the role of the genome, epigenome and transcriptome in endometriosis development and inform
new prevention and treatment strategies. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism by which histone
acetyltransferase activity and histone acetylation promotes endometrial invasion and survival. We will provide
rationale for histone acetyltransferase inhibition as a potential non-hormonal therapeutic strategy for women
with endometriosis. In Aim 2, we will address the role of variant histone exchange in endometriosis
development. Our primary objectives are to uncover the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms that lead to
endometriosis and find new ways to therapeutically target abnormal endometrial cells by leveraging
vulnerabilities that arise from epigenetic alterations in the disease. Our aspirational goals are to identify new
ways to definitively diagnose, prevent and treat endometriosis."

The rapid growth of genomic medicine reflects increases in our understanding of how genomics impacts
health. Advances in the clinical utility of patient genomic information to inform diagnostic and therapeutic
decision-making are driving increases in testing and the subsequent reporting of genomic data to electronic
health records (EHRs) and other clinical systems. Germline genomic data are presumed to be stable over a
patient’s life, but the interpretation of those data and its clinical utility will continue to evolve as new discoveries
are made and translated to clinical practice. Furthermore, modern interpretations of genomic data often include
multi-step processes in which one interpretation is used to inform another. The temporally dynamic nature of
genomic information and knowledge (GIK) and the inter-dependencies among interpretations make a formal
knowledge model for those data essential. Existing approaches to represent and manage GIK are not sufficient
to fully support the needs of genomic medicine and thus a new approach must be developed.
The specific objective of this research program is to develop and evaluate the Genomic Interpretation and
Knowledge (GenIK) Framework for capturing interpretations related to clinical genomic results as
standardized, structured data. The GenIK framework will: 1) facilitate more robust integration of genomic data
into EHRs; 2) enable scalable knowledge management; 3) enable utilization of GIK by other systems; 4)
enable clinical, translational, and discovery research; and 5) enable meaningful data sharing of GIK. Moreover,
because the framework will be based on a generalized, standards-based knowledge model, it will elegantly
extend to support new types of genomic interpretations and uses for those data. The GenIK framework will fill a
critical gap in the representation, management, and delivery of GIK, thereby advancing genomic medicine.
The proposed research program will develop foundational resources that will enable more seamless integration
of genomics within both research and clinical settings. Research Area 1 will focus on discovery activities that
support the development of the GenIK framework. Research Area 2 will focus on the translation and
application of the GenIK framework within clinical systems. Research Area 3 will focus on dissemination to
and engagement with stakeholder communities. The main hypothesis of this research is that implementations
based on the GenIK framework will more fully capture GIK than existing approaches, thereby improving the
management, use, and sharing of GIK.
The Genomic Innovator Award will enable, in team-science projects and in collaboration with genomic research
consortia, the study of the requirements for and implementation of scalable GIK management within clinical
systems. The resources developed by the proposed research program will allow the capture and exchange of
GIK to take place at the speed of discovery, supporting research in precision medicine as part of a learning
healthcare system and accelerating scientific and medical breakthroughs that improve human health."

Asthma is a major public health problem in the United States, affecting 11 million children. Despite
advances in asthma care, African Americans (AAs) are 4 times more likely to be hospitalized and
5 times more likely to die from asthma than European Americans (EAs). Several factors could be
responsible for the observed asthma racial disparities including genetic and non-genetic factors.
While epigenetics appear to serve as a critical biological switch between genetic vulnerability and
socio-environmental exposures, limited studies are available that directly map the socio-
environmental exposures with asthmatic epigenome/genome information. In addition, current
approach do not leverage existing geospatial data such as environmental exposure and
neighborhood socioeconomic conditions to improve asthma risk prediction. In this proposal, we
will utilize comprehensive geocoding algorithms, novel statistical methods to integrate social,
clinical, environmental, genetic, and epigenetic data into a composite score for asthma risk
stratification and prediction. The overall objective of this research is to conduct genome-wide
Methyl-Seq analysis and leverage existing well-phenotyped AA pediatric asthma cohort with
extensive socio-environmental exposures and ancestry-tailored multi-ethnic genotyping array
(MEGA) data from Cincinnati Pediatrics Repository to accurately determine and develop ancestry-
specific asthma risk stratification and prediction models. The objective of this application is to
undertake an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS), incorporating geocoded neighborhood-
and individual-level socio-environmental predictors, and novel analytical strategies to create a
composite risk score incorporating methylation risk score (MRS), ancestry, environmental
exposures and social characteristics to predict asthma. We will accomplish these objectives
through the following Specific Aims: 1) Develop an ancestry-specific methylation risk score (MRS)
for asthma and test its association with socio-environmental exposures contributing to asthma
risk. 2) Determine the mediation effects of MRS between genetic ancestry and asthma risk. 3)
Develop a multivariable risk predictive model for asthma incorporating MRS, genetic ancestry,
clinical, and socio-environmental risk factors. The proposed research is innovative because this
will be the first time a MRS approach will be used to develop a population-based risk profile in
asthmatics. The study will provide insights in the use of risk stratification for screening and
targeted interventions. This work is significant because it can serve as a model to study the
composite effect of MRS, ancestry, socio-environmental, and clinical risk factors on racial
disparities in other well-documented common complex diseases beyond asthma."

 Inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor is a pivotal event in the formation of most human
cancers. p53 acts as a transcription factor to modulate various types of cellular processes to
suppress cancer development. Although the classic activities of p53 including cell-cycle arrest,
senescence and apoptosis serve as critical barriers to cancer development, accumulating
evidence suggests that other unconventional mechanisms such as metabolic regulation are also
critically involved in suppressing tumor growth. Nevertheless, despite the fact that the role of the
p53 pathway in tumor suppression is indisputable, it remains a daunting task how to target this
pathway for cancer therapy. The main issue is whether activation of p53 function in vivo leads to
significant tumor regression without causing serious toxicity in normal tissues. Cancer cells rewire
cellular metabolism to meet the energetic and substrate demands of tumor development, but this
rewiring also creates metabolic vulnerabilities specific for cancer cells. By taking advantage of
these metabolic vulnerabilities, our preliminary studies showed that specific activation of the tumor
suppression function of p53 through certain metabolic targets can be effective in suppressing
tumor growth but apparently does not cause severe harm to normal tissues. The central
objective of the proposed research plan is to comprehensively define p53-mediated metabolic
regulation program that is required for its tumor suppression as a mean to identify new
targets/pathways for therapy. Toward this end, our research program will be based on two
complementary lines of research aiming to the further dissection of: 1) p53-mediated metabolic
pathways required for its tumor suppression; 2) the novel ferroptosis pathway regulated by p53
and the effects in both normal and cancer cells. We expect that the research program described
above will identify specific targets to suppress tumor growth but have minimal or at least
manageable toxicity in normal tissues."

A wide variety of subcellular complexes are composed of one or more intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs)
that are multivalent, flexible, and characterized by dynamic, reversible binding of diverse partner proteins. A
common but understudied type of multivalent IDP assembly exhibits a unique duplex topology, characterized by
parallel alignment of two IDP chains reversibly cross-linked by the ubiquitous LC8 hub protein, where the IDPs
allosterically enhance affinity for additional bivalent ligands. These duplexes can serve as a girder-like element
in large complexes, act as sensors, and facilitate or `template' the formation of large supra-molecular assemblies
(such as the dynein motor and nucleopore complex). Key features of these systems were identified in MPI
Barbar's lab, but studies of the structural and biochemical basis for this wide range of functionalities are
challenged by the diversity, internal mobility, and heterogeneity of the complexes formed.
This proposal will significantly advance our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of multivalent LC8
complex assemblies, by integrating an array of novel and existing methods of computational modeling - such as
weighted-ensemble molecular dynamics simulation - with experiments including isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and structural characterization such as nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), electron microscopy (EM), and native mass spectrometry (native MS). These techniques
were selected to address critical unanswered questions in the field: How much conformational and compositional
heterogeneity is intrinsic to these reversibly assembled duplexes, and how do they avoid a disordered state?
How does LC8 concentration, which is tightly controlled by the cell, modulate the heterogeneity? What do the
allosteric effects and associated mechanistic pathways indicate about regulation of the duplexes? What
differences are observed among duplex systems optimized for architectural vs. complex-scaffolding vs. sensing
roles? To address these questions, three largely independent aims will probe the ensemble thermodynamics
via ITC and theory dissecting species populations, the conformational ensemble via EM and theory from whole
complex- to atomistic-scale, and finally the atomistic basis of kinetic and cooperative behavior via simulations
and kinetics measurements.
The efforts will be guided by an experienced biophysics team with a wide-range of complementary expertise who
have been collaborating for several years - experts in theoretical biophysics (Zuckerman, MPI); in LC8 structural
biology, ITC and NMR (Barbar, MPI); in electron microscopy (Reichow, Co-I); and in native MS (Prell, Co-I). Our
track record of pioneering work on structure-function relations of LC8, success in both producing useful protein
constructs and handling these complex and partially disordered proteins, and the team's expertise in the battery
of computational, structural, biophysical, and biochemical techniques required to probe these systems, make us
uniquely suited to significantly advance the frontiers in the study of IDP multivalency."

Neuronal activity leads to increases in local cerebral blood flow (CBF) to allow adequate supply of O2 and
nutrients to active neurons. This process, termed neurovascular coupling (NVC), is essential for survival and its
disruption is associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Despite significant findings, we are still far from
reaching a comprehensive understanding of NVC. This prohibits us from a thorough understanding of normal
brain function and from identifying critical failures in disease and hinders investigations into the vascular origins
of cognitive impairment. The objective of this application is to investigate how K+-mediated local CBF control
emerges from the integration of neuronal inputs and autoregulatory feedback. This will be accomplished by
pursuing two specific aims: In Aim 1, models of endothelial and smooth muscle cells will be developed and
examine K+-mediated electrical signaling in capillaries and arterioles. We propose that the inward rectifying K+
channel acts as bistable, “on-off”, switch to hyperpolarize cell membranes when extracellular K+ increases. Multi-
cellular models of microvascular networks will examine communication between capillaries and their feeding
arteriole, and the significance of capillary-level NVC for local CBF control. We propose that regenerative signal
propagation enables this communication and we will test this hypothesis using modeling and an ex-vivo intact
arteriole-capillary preparation. In Aim 2, simulations in a geometrically accurate vascular network will predict
macroscopic changes in blood flow following functional activation. We will integrate theory and experiments to
analyze channelopathy-like defects, in animal models of cerebral small vessel and Alzheimer's disease. We will
test the hypothesis that impaired capillary-arteriole communication and altered myogenic response lead to a
NVC deficit and propose optimal strategies for restoring this deficit. The proposed work will provide a paradigm
for comprehensive examinations of cerebral blood flow control, for interpreting altered cellular signaling in
disease and for elucidating vascular underpinnings in cognitive impairment."
10824348,"Cholangiopathies are incurable biliary tree disorders characterized by tissue injury with neutrophil recruitment,
cholangiocyte hyperproliferation, and stromal cell expansion. Signals driving extrahepatic bile duct (EHBD)
inflammation and proliferation are poorly understood. This application aims to answer fundamental questions
about injury-driven processes promoting biliary proliferation. The rationale for these studies is that understanding
molecular mechanisms of EHBD inflammatory and proliferative responses can inform therapeutic strategies to
prevent and treat complications of cholangiopathies. My preliminary data shows a massive increase in
cholangiocyte proliferation within 24 hours after acute injury. Further, increased cholangiocyte Hedgehog (HH)
ligand targets stromal cell CXCL1, which recruits neutrophils to the injured tissue. My project focuses on
uncovering the mechanisms of this complex crosstalk involving epithelial cholangiocyte – stromal fibroblast –
neutrophil signaling to promote biliary proliferation and facilitate tissue repair. Biliary hyperproliferation is
associated with HH-dependent expression of FOSL1, a transcription factor known to mediate proliferative
responses in other tissues. IL1β is increased post EHBD injury in neutrophils and can regulate FOSL1. The
overarching hypothesis for this proposal is that in response to EHBD injury, cholangiocytes secrete Indian
HH which induces GLI1+ fibroblasts to produce CXCL1, leading to neutrophil recruitment and promotion
of cholangiocyte proliferation through a IL1β/FOSL1-dependent mechanism. I will use state-of-the art in
vivo genetic mouse and pharmacologic approaches combined with ex vivo human and mouse organoid and
primary culture models to define the molecular mechanisms of cellular crosstalk regulating EHBD repair. Bile
duct ligation (BDL) will be used as an acute biliary injury model. CUT&RUN chromatin mapping, cell isolation by
flow cytometry, and RNA-seq approaches will be conducted within this proposal. Findings will be validated using
archived biliary tissues from patients with/without cholangiopathy. Aim 1 will focus on GLI1+ stromal cells and
regulation of Cxcl1 expression to determine if HH signaling induces fibroblasts to express Cxcl1 via direct
transcriptional activation by GLI1. This aim will use reporter mice to isolate GLI1+ cells for downstream in vivo
and ex vivo analyses. Pharmacological activators and inhibitors of HH signaling will be used to test effects of
GLI1 modulation on gene expression. Aim 2 will focus on neutrophil-derived pro-proliferative signals to test
whether neutrophils promote biliary proliferation via a IL1β/FOSL1-dependent mechanism and identify candidate
neutrophil-derived factors. Aim 2 will use reporter mice to isolate neutrophils for downstream in vivo and ex vivo
analyses. A genetic mouse model will test effects of Fosl1 deletion on biliary proliferation post EHBD injury. This
proposal will allow me to gain proficiency in state-of-the-art tools and generate preliminary data for a successful
R01 application. Ultimately, defining the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating EHBD injury responses
may inform novel therapeutic strategies to improve outcomes of patients with cholangiopathies."

 Damage to the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can be incurred through a wide spectrum of conditions
including trauma, metabolic imbalances, and chemotherapy. Neuronal injuries occur when their long and
fragile processes (i.e. axons) are damaged, for example by stretching or severing. Compared to PNS neurons,
the regenerative capacity of injured central nervous system (CNS) neurons is extremely limited, typically
resulting in life-long disability. Regenerative growth of axons can occur in the injured peripheral nervous
system, however, restoration of function is often incomplete, resulting in loss of motor and sensory function
and frequently the development of neuropathic pain.
Regeneration of an injured axon is thought to involve changes in microtubule dynamics and post-
translational modifications (PTMs). Microtubules are dynamic polymers of α,β-tubulin and are the core
structural element of axons and dendrites. Microtubules also serve as tracks for molecular motor proteins
(kinesin, cytoplasmic dynein) that transport various cargos between synaptic terminals and the neuronal cell
soma. Following injury, microtubules undergo rapid fragmentation, a process known as Wallerian
degeneration. In developing neurons and during axon regeneration, microtubules in the neuronal growth cone
and axon shaft play key roles in axon guidance and axon elongation.
 Regulation of MT function is largely achieved by the differential expression of α- and β-tubulin isotypes,
and by PTMs of tubulin subunits within the microtubule polymer. Studies of microtubule isotypes and PTMs
inherently rely on antibodies that require fixation and permeabilization of the cell or tissue, which severely limits
our understanding of the spatiotemporal component of tubulin PTMs. We have developed a pipeline that allows
us to generate live-cell probes for tubulin PTMs. Here, we will generate probes for tubulin isotypes and PTMs
relevant to neuronal degeneration and regeneration and use them to map the spatiotemporal patterns of
changes to the microtubule cytoskeleton following injury to the PNS and CNS."

Suicide is a leading cause of death in the US with an estimated 46,000 suicide deaths occuring in 2020.
Loneliness, an interpersonal risk factor for suicide, was recognized as having reached epidemic proportions by
the US Surgeon General in 2017 before rates further worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the
public health impact of loneliness, the National Academies of Engineering, Sciences, and Medicine have called
for health systems to take an active role and intervene to reduce loneliness. Primary care is the optimal health
system setting to deliver loneliness interventions to prevent suicide because primary care increasingly screens
for loneliness along with other social determinants of health. Primary care practices also increasingly employ
behavioral health care managers who can deliver loneliness interventions along with treatments for depression
and anxiety disorders that may impair recovery from chronic loneliness and contribute to suicide risk. Prior
primary care approaches to loneliness have had mixed results and there remains no established, effective,
ready-to-adopt model to reduce loneliness and suicidal ideation in primary care.
This study will adapt two loneliness interventions, social prescribing and brief cognitive therapy, to be delivered
within primary care. Social prescribing addresses the structural determinants of loneliness (i.e., breadth and
frequency of social interactions) by linking patients to community-based organizations or activities (e.g.,
volunteering) whereas brief cognitive therapy addresses the cognitive determinants of loneliness (i.e.,
relationship expectations) through education, reflections, and guided exercises. In contrast to prior studies,
both interventions will be adapted to be delivered by a behavioral health care manager working within a
primary care-based collaborative care management program. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Adapt
social prescribing and brief cognitive therapy interventions for loneliness to be delivered as components of
primary care collaborative care management and 2) conduct a randomized controlled pilot study (N=60) to
determine feasibility and acceptability of the two interventions and trial protocols.
The Aim 1 development activities will be guided by the ADAPT-ITT (assessment, decision, administration,
production, topical experts, integration, training, testing) framework and will engage patient and provider
stakeholders to inform production of manuals to guide training and pilot testing of the interventions. In the Aim
2 pilot study, patients from two primary care sites who screen positive for loneliness and suicidal ideation will
be randomly assigned to one of the two interventions or to EUC. At 3 months, participants in the intervention
arms will receive the alternate intervention for an additional 3 months, and EUC participants will continue to
receive EUC. Feasibility and acceptability will be measured to inform a future adequately powered trial to
determine the interventions’ mechanisms and effectiveness for reducing loneliness and suicidal ideation."

A critical requirement to sustain the rapid advances in clinical oncology research that have been made over the
last 20 years is to train and mentor the next generation of cancer clinician-investigators. Individuals who can
write and carry out clinical trials that will promote increasing benefit for cancer patients are a crucial resource
that must be preserved. The objectives of the NYU K12 Program are to provide the protected time which will
foster the creativity, drive, and intellectual skills necessary to produce investigators who will make the key clinical
discoveries in cancer research over the next few decades. We seek to equip scholars with career development
skills that will guide them through productive careers as clinician-investigators. This first-time proposal is based
on a record of training and mentoring outstanding clinical researchers while serving as junior faculty at NYU, the
provision of a strong institutional commitment to support development of clinician investigators, representation
of experienced and motivated medical, radiation and surgical oncologists among the mentors, an emphasis on
informatics and computational biology and critical infrastructure that is part of an institutional Clinical and
Translational Science Institute (CTSI) to leverage the strengths of the greater institution. NYU K12 scholars will
complete training on the responsible conduct of research, general and targeted formal didactics instruction
addressing proficiency in clinical and translational research, Master’s-level training in multidisciplinary clinical
research, specialized course work, training in team science, individualized and didactic training in grant
preparation, exposure to alternative career opportunities, and mentored performance of an innovative high-
impact translational research project. Expectations at completion include publication of 2-3 first and/or senior
author manuscripts and submission of a K- or R-level grant or equivalent. Three scholars yearly will dedicate
75% effort to research and career development activities for up to three years each, supervised by mentors with
extensive and outstanding mentoring experience. A strongly invested K12 Executive Committee and a broad
and diverse program faculty will promote each scholar’s mentoring. Our first aim is to provide personalized
mentoring and didactic training to advance the clinical and translational research careers of our cohort of K12
scholars. Our second aim is to allow the K12 scholars to identify, choose and pursue research opportunities
relevant to advancing the field of clinical oncology. Our third aim is to enable K12 scholars to establish
multidisciplinary clinical and translational research networks and collaborations to ensure the success of their
efforts and promote their careers in clinical oncology research."

Cryptococcus neoformans is a devastating opportunistic fungus that causes hundreds of thousands of deaths
each year, mainly in developing countries. This pathogen is surrounded by a flexible wall that maintains cell
integrity and anchors a protective polysaccharide capsule. The cell wall, which consists mainly of interlinked
polysaccharides, is a compelling topic of study because it is required for viability, absent from the cells of mam-
malian hosts, and a proven target for antifungal therapies. Almost a century ago, it was postulated that yeast
walls contain glycogen, similar in structure to the intracellular storage molecule but linked to the cell wall itself.
However, where this occurs in nature, as well as how this material is made and reaches the cell surface, have
never been established, constituting major gaps in our knowledge of an essential structure. We recently discov-
ered that a previously unstudied cryptococcal protein influences both glycogen synthesis and cell wall integrity,
potentially providing a key to this area of research. This protein is also required for normal infection, suggesting
a potential vulnerability in the wall that might be productively exploited.
The long-term goal of our research is to define the biochemical pathways by which cryptococcal glycans are
made, to advance our fundamental understanding and improve the outcome of this devastating infection. In this
proposal we focus on the novel area of cell wall glycogen and an intriguing glycosyltransferase we have discov-
ered, which we call GTX. In Aim 1 we will isolate and quantitate cell wall glycogen from C. neoformans grown in
various environments, including host-like conditions, and determine how this material fits into the complex mesh
of the cell wall. In Aim 2 we will use biochemical assays to define and characterize the activity of purified GTX,
which we already have in hand. In Aim 3 we will assess the phenotypes and virulence characteristics of mutants
lacking GTX. We will also localize this protein and identify its interacting partners. These studies will be enabled
by our expertise in cryptococcal biology and advice from expert colleagues, which we will integrate into thoughtful
and rigorous studies. Together, these experiments will define a new component of the cryptococcal cell wall and
determine the activity of a novel protein implicated in pathogenesis.
The major antifungal drugs that target cell walls are not effective against C. neoformans. It is therefore critical to
find other vulnerabilities in the cryptococcal wall that can be productively exploited – our proposed studies are a
focused step on this path. Completing them will advance our understanding of fungal cell wall construction,
define a novel glycan synthetic process, and potentially suggest a point of intervention for antifungal therapy."

 Blood diseases such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) arise from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)
that acquire genetic mutations which corrupt critical HSC functions. One of the most recurrently mutated
genes in these neoplasms is the de novo DNA methyltransferase enzyme DNMT3A. However, DNMT3A
mutations can occur in HSCs long before clinical presentation. Recent studies have shown that the HSC
clones that predominate with age often contain mutations that are characteristic of myeloid neoplasms. This
phenomenon is known as clonal hematopoiesis (CH), but only a small fraction of individuals with CH go on to
develop a blood disease. This suggests that in addition to genetics, there must be other factors which act
differently between individuals that select for propagation of HSCs with these mutations. Our lab is interested
in identifying factors that change with age which may provide selective pressures for these mutant clones,
focusing on inflammation. The prior funding period identified interferon gamma (IFNg) as an environmental
stressor that selects for the outgrowth of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs. While chronic IFNg signaling is detrimental to
normal HSCs, functionality of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs is preserved in this setting, presenting a mechanism
whereby HSCs with these mutations gain clonal dominance in settings of inflammation. New data generated in
our lab show that Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs are not only resistant to the detrimental effects of IFNg in vivo, but
also the mutant clones produce more IFNg themselves in response to inflammation. This is associated with
increased Cxcl9 expression from the mutant clones and T-cell infiltration into the BM. These observations form
the scientific premise for this renewal application. We hypothesize that IFNg production by Dnmt3a-mutant
clones suppresses other HSC genotypes and remodels the niche through T-cell infiltration to further reinforce
their competitive advantage. We propose the following Specific Aims to investigate these questions;
  Determine if IFNg production from Dnmt3a-mutant clones exacerbates their competitive
advantage.
  Determine if Dnmt3a-mutant clones remodel the BM niche.
  Examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Dnmt3a-mutant cells are
 hypersensitive to IFNg.
 The overall goal of this work is to determine the mechanisms by which inflammatory signals promote clonal
expansion of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs in the bone marrow. Approaches to eliminate or selectively inhibit
emerging DNMT3A-mutant HSC clones from high-risk CH+ individuals may provide a window for intervention
before the mutant cells are able to establish clonal dominance and evolve to fulminant disease."
10880599,"Project Summary: Biological processes ranging from gene transcription to behavior oscillate and are
synchronized to the 24-hour day/night cycle. Mammalian circadian rhythms, orchestrated by the hypothalamic
suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) allow appropriately timed physiological and behavioral responses to daily
recurring external cues (i.e. sunrise or timed meal availability). The resulting synchrony of physiology to the
astronomical day maximizes metabolic efficiency and good health. However, many of the stresses of modern
society (i.e. artificial lighting and omnipresence of food) weaken and desynchronize circadian rhythms. This in
turn increases the prevalence of many pathologies including metabolic disorders and neurodegenerative
diseases. The aim of my laboratory is to determine how circadian rhythms are synchronized to external cues
(circadian entrainment) and how desynchronization impacts health. Although the neuronal pathways of light-
driven entrainment are well-established, how other external cues, such as food availability, social interactions or
exercise, influence the workings of the SCN remains unknown. In a recent breakthrough, we identified a neuronal
connection between midbrain dopaminergic neurons that are activated in response to salient events and SCN
neurons that express the dopamine receptor Drd1. We showed that this pathway accelerates photoentrainment
and drives palatable food consumption outside of mealtimes. In parallel, we identified a novel molecular player
that is necessary for anticipation-related activity to time-restricted food access. Here, we propose to leverage
our expertise in disentangling circadian entrainment neurocircuitry to delineate the mechanisms by which
rewarding cues modulate the SCN circadian clock. Furthermore, we will determine whether strengthening
circadian rhythmicity ameliorates symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases. Our first objective is to gain a
mechanistic understanding of how salient events impact SCN activity and circadian entrainment. We hypothesize
that activation of dopaminergic signaling decreases the amplitude of SCN oscillation and allows faster
photoentrainment. This novel insight will be useful to develop strategies to curb the negative impact of circadian
desynchrony. Our second goal is to identify the midbrain dopaminergic cell population that targets the SCN and
promotes palatable food consumption outside of meal times, leading to weight gain and metabolic disorder. We
predict that by mimicking dopaminergic signaling in the SCN, we will control food consumption. Delineating this
pathway will provide therapeutic targets against diet induced metabolic dysfunction and obesity. Our final
objective is to determine if high amplitude circadian rhythms, by daily consolidation of light and food access, is
sufficient to slow the progression of a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). If successful, entrainment
strategies will become potential treatments for AD patients and people with high-risk of developing AD. We
expect our work will provide a better understanding of the relationship between entrainment cues, physiology
and behavior while providing tangible strategies against the adverse consequences of circadian misalignment."
10890061,"Enteric pathogen infections are a leading cause of the global disease burden, with the largest burden among
children in low-resource settings. Stool-based PCR methods have dramatically improved our ability to measure
enteric infections, but the challenge of collecting stool and need for near-continuous monitoring to detect many
globally important pathogens has thwarted broader use in large-scale surveillance. Large-scale, population-
based surveys now regularly collect blood to monitor transmission and burden of diseases such as HIV, malaria
and dengue. Broader testing of blood collected in such surveys with multiplex assays represents a new
opportunity to measure enteric pathogen transmission and burden. Antibody-based measures could complement
stool-based PCR testing because antibody responses remain elevated for many months after infection, thus
providing more information in studies with infrequent measurements. Our team has developed multiplex bead
assays that measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to diverse enteric pathogens. In preliminary studies we
have shown that IgG levels can be used to measure heterogeneity in enteric pathogen transmission between
populations. We have also shown the results generalize to pathogens that span taxa. In this application, we
propose to complete a series of studies that address key next steps to advance the seroepidemiology of enteric
pathogens in low-resource settings. We will conduct a longitudinal birth cohort in Ecuador that pairs high
resolution, multiplex stool-based PCR infection with longitudinal, multiplex IgG and IgA measurements. Our 17-
year research history at the site has documented substantial variation in enteric pathogen infection across a
rural-urban gradient, making it an ideal setting for the research. The cohort will enroll 600 children from three
sites across a rural-urban gradient, and measure them frequently from birth to 24 months. On the Luminex
platform, we will pair multiplex PCR assessment for 15 enteric pathogens with IgG and IgA assessment in a
multiplex bead assay that includes antigens to 7 enteric pathogens: Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic
Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, and
norovirus. In Aim 1, we will use molecular and antibody-based measures to study force of infection of the enteric
pathogens across a rural-urban gradient. This will represent the first broad-based comparison of
seroepidemiologic measures against patent infection for enterics. In Aim 2, we will estimate enteric pathogen
force of infection by applying current-status models to population-based, cross-sectional serology surveys in the
region, and will benchmark the cross-sectional estimates against those obtained in the concurrent longitudinal
study. In Aim 3, we will study IgG and IgA kinetics following infection for each of the 7 pathogens, and develop
models to accurately predict recent infections and incidence from antibody levels measured in cross-sectional
serology surveys. Completion of these aims will result in generalizable seroepidemiologic methods that have the
potential to transform measurement of enteric pathogen transmission and burden in low-resource settings."
10893608,"Project Summary
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a cardiac arrythmia that affects over 5 million individuals in the US and quintuples the
risk of stroke. AF is a critical disease state to measure the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on non-COVID
disease because every aspect of stroke prevention in AF is vulnerable to disruption: 1) Patients with new onset
AF may be more likely to remain undiagnosed. 2) Established AF patients may have complications that remain
undetected and worsen without treatment. 3) Patients newly diagnosed with AF may be less likely to initiate
stroke prevention therapy with oral anticoagulation (OAC). 4) Established OAC users may have increased
difficulty adhering to therapy. 5) Patients on warfarin, an OAC agent that requires routine blood tests, may
have less frequent monitoring.
Our goal is to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnosis, therapy initiation, therapy
adherence, monitoring, and health outcomes for patients with AF. We will determine whether pandemic
disruptions of AF care have exacerbated health disparities. We will also assess the role of telemedicine, whose
uptake has been catalyzed by the pandemic, in offsetting decreased access to in-person care during crises.
We will use 2015-2022 claims data for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries and Optum® Integrated claims-
electronic health record data for commercially insured and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. We will construct
interrupted time series analyses to measure changes in outcomes after pandemic start and pandemic end. To
determine whether the pandemic has exacerbated disparities, we will test whether the degree of change in
outcomes differed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and area-level measures of urbanization, socioeconomic status,
deprivation, racial composition, and segregation. In aims 3 and 4, we will use marginal structural models to
estimate the association between telehealth visits and outcomes. We will achieve four specific aims:
(1) quantify changes in the incidence rate of new AF diagnoses in 2016-2021, including new AF diagnoses
manifesting as stroke; (2) determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased OAC
initiation among newly diagnosed AF patients; (3) quantify changes in adherence and monitoring of OAC
therapy among established AF patients; (4) quantify changes in the incidence rates of stroke, bleeding,
cardiovascular hospitalization, and death among established AF patients.
Our quantification of pandemic effects on AF care will have major implications for the provision of chronic
disease care during emergencies. Our identification of populations disproportionately affected by the pandemic
and our determination of the ability of telemedicine to offset decreased access to in-person care will inform
clinical guidance and policies that prevent care avoidance during health emergencies, optimize models for the
delivery of chronic disease care during major crises, and protect vulnerable populations."
10897231,"The long term goals of this project are to understand the molecular and biophysical mechanisms for the
regulation of cardiac pacemaking in sinoatrial node myocytes (SAMs) across the gamut of physiological
conditions. SAMs function as cardiac pacemaker cells by firing spontaneous action potentials (APs). As in
other excitable cells, the precise shape of sinoatrial APs reflects the composite activity of the unique
complement of ion channels and transporters on the plasma membrane. AP waveforms are not static; they
vary in response to short- and long-term changes in physiological context. In principle, differences in AP
waveforms should lend insight into the changes in ionic currents that underlie cellular electrophysiological
responses. However, our ability to decode the causal relationships between ionic currents and AP shape
remains an elusive goal in all excitable cells. This gap in understanding is caused by a lack of information
about AP waveforms and currents in different physiological contexts and by difficulties inherent to the study of
interrelated systems using conventional research approaches. The present proposal addresses these general
questions by focusing on the mechanisms by which aging slows cardiac pacemaking. Proposed experiments
follow from work in prior funding periods and new preliminary data which show that aging slows pacemaking in
part by decreasing the spontaneous AP firing rate of SAMs in association with changes in a limited subset of
AP waveform parameters and reductions in the funny current (If) and voltage-gated Ca2+ currents (ICa,L and
ICa,T). They also address the prior observation that age-dependent reductions in pacemaker activity and If in
SAMs can be reversed by high concentrations of exogenous cAMP via a cAMP-mimetic mechanism.
Proposed experiments will use new research tools developed during the current funding period (1) to define
age-dependent changes in the relative contributions of currents active during different phases of the AP in
SAMs, (2) to test the ability of different currents, singly and in combination, to transform the AP phenotype of
young and aged SAMs, and (3) to test the hypothesis that age-dependent reduction in a novel If regulatory
protein is responsible for the hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependence and resulting slowing of AP firing rate
in SAMs and heart rate in mice. Results of these studies will experimentally define for the first time causal
links between individual ionic currents and AP waveform parameters in SAMs that are responsible for cardiac
pacemaking in general and will reveal how these mechanisms are changed during normal aging."
10851929,"Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) poses a triple threat to public health, as its prevalence is on the rise, its costs are
immense, and there is no effective therapy. However, drug development attempts for the treatment of AD have
met with minimal success. The failure is largely attributable to a reductionist concept of ""one drug, one gene,
one disease."" As AD is a multigenic heterogeneous illness, a new therapeutic strategy is urgently required to
concurrently target the numerous pathogenic processes involved for the genesis and progression of AD in
each individual patient. Many translational bioinformatics strategies for AD drug repurposing have been
developed in recent years. Existing target-based, phenotype-based, network-based, and patient-based drug
repurposing strategies are unable to fully address the challenges of AD drug repurposing due to the lack of
thoroughly validated drug targets, potent lead compounds, and high-throughput phenotype readouts that can
characterize the molecular complexity of AD. Over the past decade, we have built an artificial intelligence-
based quantitative systems pharmacology (AI-QSP) platform that attempts to predict and characterize
genome-wide chemical-protein interactions and functional activities, as well as correlate molecular interactions
with phenotypic responses. Our AI-QSP platform integrates diverse omics data synergistically and incorporates
machine learning, biophysics, and systems biology methodologies. The AI-QSP platform has been effectively
applied to drug repurposing including AD, polypharmacology, side effect prediction, and precision medicine.
Established our proof-of-concept studies, we propose to develop and thoroughly evaluate a unique
computational methodology that combines target-based and mechanism-driven phenotypic chemical screening
for AD individualized drug repurposing. Using a novel domain adaptation strategy, we will expand our context-
independent phenotypic compound screening methodologies to AD patient-specific, cell type-specific,
transcriptome-based drug repurposing. In addition, we will analyze the ADME features of repurposed
pharmaceuticals in the human brain utilizing cutting-edge physiologically based pharmacokinetics (PBPK)
techniques. We will improve state-of-the-art drug-gene-disease network models for Alzheimer's disease drug
repurposing by incorporating understudied dark proteins that are abundant in the target list suggested by AD
omics studies and their inhibitory or activatory effects, and by applying graph mining techniques for drug-gene-
disease link predictions. Using cell-based disease models and RNA-seq studies, we will combine
complementary phenotype-based and target-based techniques to rank drug candidates and confirm their
efficacy and toxicity on AD treatment. In conclusion, the successful completion of this project could provide the
scientific community with a novel translational bioinformatics resource for identifying potential therapeutics for
effective personalized AD treatments and advancing drug repurposing to a new phase of lead optimizations
and clinical trials."
10772179,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 Single ventricle heart disease (SVHD) adolescents show cognitive deficits (~50% subjects), affecting
academic achievement, self-care ability, quality of life, and mortality and morbidity. Brain changes appear in
areas (hippocampus, cingulate, insula, caudate, prefrontal) that mediate cognitive functions. However, the
underlying processes for brain tissue changes in SVHD are unclear, but may include hypoxemia from lower O2
saturation and reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) from low cardiac output. Chronically low cardiac output and
lower O2 saturation are common in SVHD contributing to hypoxemia that induces oxidative stress and
mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction alters metabolites, including the N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA;
neuronal integrity), choline (Cho; membrane metabolism), creatine (Cr; energy metabolism), and myo-inositol
(MI; astrocyte proliferation). Also, antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH) levels that play a significant role
against oxidative stress, regulate neuronal/cellular protection from excessive reactive oxygen species. However,
regional brain metabolites and antioxidant status in SVHD is unknown that can be examined with the 3D Echo
Planar Spectroscopic Imaging (3D EPSI) and the MEshcher–GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy (MEGA-
PRESS). In addition, CBF is highly dependent on cardiac output, and lower cardiac output can result to reduced
CBF, which has not been reported after completed staged surgical palliation. Impaired CBF and lower O2
saturation can further contribute to oxidative stress, leading to tissue changes in cognitive control areas, affecting
associated functions. Regional brain CBF can be assessed by arterial spin labeling imaging, O2 saturation with
pulse oximetry, and oxidative stress with serum inflammatory biomarkers. Thus, using 25 SVHD and 25 healthy
controls, the specific aims are to: 1) assess whole-brain metabolites (NAA, Cho, Cr, and MI; using 3D EPSI) and
antioxidant (GSH; using MEGA-PRESS) in SVHD and controls; 2) identify brain CBF differences, using ASL
methods, baseline O2 saturation levels, using pulse oximetry, between SVHD and controls, and relationships
between regional CBF, O2 saturation, and cognition (using the Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning
2) in SVHD patients; and 3) examine inflammatory serum biomarkers in SVHD and controls, and correlate those
markers with brain metabolites, CBF, and O2 saturation values in SVHD subjects. In summary, mitochondrial
and oxidative stress mechanisms contributing to changes in brain metabolites and antioxidant, reduced CBF in
cognitive regulatory areas, and serum inflammatory biomarkers, as well as links among these measures in SVHD
patients will be examined. The outcomes from this R21 exploratory study will have significant implications on
identification of treatments for rescue/restore brain tissue that might include strategies to increase NAA,
antioxidant, and Cr levels, as well as improve CBF, and could be implemented on a large clinical trial to improve
cognition, school performance, and reduced morbidity and mortality, and increased life quality in SVHD patients."
10911827,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI), also called catheter-related sepsis, is one of the most frequent,
lethal, and costly complications of central venous catheterization. CRBSI affects hundreds of millions of people
worldwide; in the U.S. alone, it affects more than 250,000 patients yearly. These infections are mostly caused
by the migration of microorganisms found on the patient's skin flora at the catheter insertion site. Tremendous
efforts have been undertaken to reduce catheter-related sepsis, including improvements to the catheter insertion
guidelines and the development of dressings impregnated with antibiotics. These methods help reduce the
number of bacteria on the patient's skin but do not eliminate them. No available catheter dressing enables
automated and early detection of bacterial growth at the catheter insertion site. Such catheter dressing is a
critical need for early detection of CRBSI, allowing for the removal/replacement of the catheter, and, as needed,
for early treatment of patients with tailored antibiotic therapy. In addition, it remains a clinical challenge to detect
bacterial colonization on the skin at early stages without catheter removal due to the human skin's highly flexible
and topographical nature. Flexible biosensors that provide conformal and seamless adherence to the skin can
help, but previous studies on the merits of wearable and flexible sensors to detect bacterial infection have been
limited to wound infections measured by indirect parameters (e.g., pH) that are subject to change with dietary
restrictions and not specific to bacterial infection. Therefore, a significant knowledge gap exists in the use of
wearable and flexible sensors integrated with electronics for real-time monitoring of direct bacterial growth at the
catheter insertion site for the early detection of CRBSI-related infection risks. The overall objective of this
application is to address this need and knowledge gap by developing a fully integrated, wirelessly operated
catheter dressing that is capable of monitoring bacterial growth at the catheter insertion site in real-time and non-
invasively to enable automated early detection of infection originating from the skin. The central hypothesis is
that the electrochemical activity of live bacteria at the catheter insertion site can be directly measured, and
acquired data can be classified using machine learning, thereby allowing precise monitoring of extraluminal
contamination in real-time. To attain the overall objective, the following two specific aims will be pursued: Aim 1:
Develop an integrated catheter dressing (ICD) capable of real-time monitoring of bacterial growth at the catheter
insertion site. Aim 2: Validate and optimize the ICD for early detection of catheter-related sepsis on a skin
phantom and an animal model. These aims will be accomplished by a team of skilled experts and excellent
resources. The proposed research is significant because the ICD can transform the current point-of-care
practices, ultimately has the potential to reduce infection risks, health care costs, and morbidity and mortality
rates related to CRBSI, and monitor the infection status in real-time, non-invasively, and at the point of care."
10893978,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Problematic substance use is associated with significant personal and socioeconomic costs (accounting for
approximately 5% of global disease burden and worldwide deaths). Substance use initiation, progression to
heavy use, and early onset substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly emerge during adolescence and young
adulthood. This developmental period of risk is theorized to result from typical patterns of regionally
asynchronous brain maturation (i.e., rapid and early development of limbic regions alongside relatively immature
prefrontal and multimodal association cortices) resulting in a diminished ability to suppress inappropriate
emotions, desires, and actions when salient environmental cues are present. During later young adulthood the
stabilization, reduction, or desistance of heavy use typically occurs alongside maturing cognitive control and
emotional regulation abilities coinciding with cortical development. Brain and behavioral maturation may also be
influenced by substance use. As genetic and environmental risk factors for substance involvement are
predominantly shared across substances, understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying
these shared risk factors in a developmental context will broadly improve our etiologic understanding of
substance involvement liability and refine treatment and prevention. In this 5-year R01 (responding to PAR-19-
162), we propose to test whether putative behavioral and neural mechanisms of stage-based addiction may link
broad spectrum SUD genomic liability and environmental risk to substance involvement trajectories from
childhood – young adulthood using longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development
(ABCD) Study (N=11,875 followed from ages 9-16) along with other samples that uniquely extend the temporal
scope of ABCD to comprehensively examine brain-behavior developmental interplay related to substance use
and misuse (e.g., National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence followed 830
individuals from ages 12-32). Disentangling the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying broad spectrum
genetic and environmental liability to SUD will inform our etiologic understanding of substance use initiation,
escalation, and desistence that may ultimately contribute to substance-related policy, education, nosology,
prevention, and treatment. Primary deliverables from this project will be manuscripts evaluating whether behavior
and neural phenotypes may represent mechanisms underlying polygenic and polyenvironmental risk for
substance use disorders."

Although therapeutic use of cannabis is increasing, findings are mixed regarding therapeutic effects of
cannabis for certain conditions, such as anxiety. Further, acute cannabis effects could adversely impact
psychomotor performance (e.g., slowed reaction time), with subsequent negative effects on daily activities
(e.g., work performance, driving skills). Low burden methods to monitor acute cannabis effects through
sensors in personal smartphones could ultimately help reduce cannabis's acute negative effects on
psychomotor performance by helping to raise a person's awareness of cannabis-related impairment. Toward
this goal, this R01 will collaborate with individuals who use medical cannabis (MC) in monitoring, with their
smartphone, acute therapeutic and adverse effects of cannabis use. Individuals who use MC commonly report
cannabis use to relieve chronic pain and/or anxiety, the two conditions of interest for this R01. Smartphone will
be used to conduct symptom monitoring of acute cannabis effects on chronic pain and anxiety using Ecological
Momentary Assessment (EMA). Phone sensor data will be used to examine acute cannabis effects on
psychomotor performance. These fine-grained smartphone ""micro"" data (e.g., momentary-level) will be
combined with longer-term follow-up over 1-year, to examine the impact of cannabis use at a more ""macro""
level (e.g., over months), because cannabis effects (e.g., on anxiety) at ""micro"" and ""macro"" time scales may
differ. This R01 will recruit individuals who report therapeutic use of cannabis, with chronic pain and/or anxiety
as the primary reasons for MC use (N=400, age >18; 50% female). Participants complete lab assessments at
baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months in a repeated measures design. Saliva sample for THC and CBD level will be
done at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months. Each assessment (baseline, 3-, 6-, 12-months) is followed by 14-day
daily EMA and phone sensor data collection. Daily EMA (3x/day) and self-initiated EMA of cannabis use
(medical, non-medical) will be used. Phone sensor data include, for example, keyboard use (not message
content), and accelerometer (e.g., to detect activity level). Study aim 1 will examine links between acute
cannabis use and effects (EMA report), psychomotor performance (phone sensor data), and self-reported daily
cognitive functioning (e.g., react slowly to things). Study aim 2 will test links, over 1-year, of longer-term effects
of cannabis use, computerized measures of psychomotor performance, and self-report of cannabis-related
consequences. For each aim, gender differences in cannabis's short and longer term effects will be explored.
The combination of fine-grained subjective (EMA) and objective (phone sensor) data, collected at micro (EMA)
and macro time scales over 1-year, will help resolve mixed findings on possible cannabis-related therapeutic
benefit, acute risks, and longer-term outcomes (e.g., on psychomotor performance). In line with NIDA priorities,
this R01's novel combination of symptom monitoring methods (EMA, phone sensor data), and ""micro"" and
""macro"" data, will guide development of mHealth interventions that reduce risk for cannabis-related harm."

 The proposed Animal Models and Tissue Analysis Core (Core C) is an essential component
to the goals of this PPG. To support the research strategies and success of the individual
projects proposed in this PPG application, Core C will serve each of the 3 projects of the PPG
with a variety of animal models of arterial thrombosis, atherosclerosis, venous thrombosis, and
spontaneous and pristane-induced systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition, it will
provide comprehensive tissue, blood and urine sample analysis for each of the 3 projects.
Furthermore, Core C will train fellows and technical staff of the individual projects to perform
animal studies. Lastly, Core C has access to archival FFPE specimens at the University
Hospitals that is overseen by Dr. Gilmore, a Co-Investigator of Core C, who will ensure that all
IRB requirements for discarded tissue research have been met. Dr. Gilmore will locate
appropriate tissues for the research of the PPG and provide Core C with the necessary clinical
information to facilitate the analyses. The services Core C will provide require specialized
technical skills and equipment. Core C will alleviate the need for each of the investigators to
establish the techniques in their individual laboratories, thereby increasing efficiency, reducing
experimental variation, and providing economy of scale. The main advantages and innovation of
Core C are to provide a dedicated, highly skillful, accessible and cost effective resource for
animal models and tissue analysis.
 The proposed Core C has extensive experience in animal models for cardiovascular
research focusing on various disease models, including thrombosis, atherosclerosis, vasculitis,
stroke, cardiac hypertrophy, analysis and quantitation of mouse tissue and fluids specimens.
The models and analysis have been well-established and published (see Biosketch of Core C

murine models of vascular injury, thrombosis, atherosclerosis, stroke, and cardiac hypertrophy.
In addition, Dr. Wang's over 25-years' research experience working with animals has prepared
her well for any additional expertise and skills involving animals if needed for Core C. Core C
will quickly adopt any innovative animal models once they become available and are determined
appropriate for the purpose of the projects. Furthermore, Dr. Wang has collaborated with all

Much progress has been achieved in building computational models that describe how visual stimuli are encoded
and transformed across the hierarchy of visual areas in the primate brain. However, relatively little attention has
been given to the active component of visual processing, whereby the observer’s engagement in a cognitive or
perceptual task can exert substantial influence on stimulus-evoked activity. The long-term goal of the proposed
research is to develop models that account for not only stimulus-driven but also task-driven effects in the visual
system. To achieve this goal, we invest effort in improving analysis methodology and in generating large high-
quality experimental datasets. In Aim 1, we develop and optimize methods that provide robust fMRI
measurements at the level of single trials. This includes a method that exploits temporal dynamics to isolate
BOLD signals that are more closely related to local neural activity, and an algorithm that improves signal-to-
noise ratio in general linear modeling of fMRI data. In Aim 2, we acquire and prepare a high-field (7T) fMRI
dataset in which a large variety of tasks are performed on a common set of visual stimuli. This dataset exploits
deep sampling of a small number of subjects, and will generate a rich, reusable resource for the fields of cognitive
and computational neuroscience. In Aim 3, we exploit the dataset to test an extant model of how top-down
influences from the intraparietal sulcus modulate responses in ventral visual cortex and to assess how top-down
signals from frontal cortex modulate the fidelity of working memory stimulus encoding in visual cortex. Overall,
this multidisciplinary proposal will deliver reusable methods and data resources, and will push computational
modeling from the domain of stimulus representation into better understanding how the visual system mediates
real-world visual perception and task engagement. Advancing our understanding of the computational
mechanisms underlying visual processing in healthy individuals is a critical step for unraveling the nature of
sensory disorders such as prosopagnosia and dyslexia."

Oncogenic mutations in KRAS represent the most prevalent genomic driver event in lung adenocarcinoma
(LUAD) (~30%) and account for ~25,000 deaths annually in the U.S. Immunotherapy (IO) with immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) is active in KRAS-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), however only a minority
of patients exhibit long-lasting responses. Co-occurring genomic alterations can shape the immunobiology of
KRAS-mutant NSCLC and impact its response to ICI. Loss-of-function somatic mutations in RBM10, encoding
a regulator of alternative splicing (AS), are prevalent in LUAD (~8%) and are significantly enriched in KRAS-
mutant NSCLC (~25%). We found that loss of RBM10 in KRAS-mutant NSCLC tumors and cell lines results in
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and STING-dependent but cGAS-independent NF-κB signaling, that establish
an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) – rich in MDSCs and M2-macrophages – and support
tumor immune escape. Critically, RD NSCLC exhibit selective sensitivity to anti-CSF1R, that depends on
functional CD8+ T-cells. Preliminary evidence points to accumulation of R-loops and distinct STING isoforms as
candidate mechanisms that underpin DDR activation and preferential NF-κB engagement in RD cells. Based on
our preliminary findings we hypothesize that: 1. In KRAS-mutant NSCLC, RBM10 loss triggers R-loop
accumulation and aberrant DDR signaling that support STING-dependent but cGAS-independent pro-
tumorigenic NF-κB signaling; 2. Splicing dysregulation upon RBM10 loss promotes STING isoforms that
preferentially engage NF-κB over TBK1 and IRF3; 3. RBM10 loss remodels the NSCLC TME and fosters immune
evasion 4. The sensitivity of RD NSCLC to ICI can be enhanced by co-targeting STAT3 with TTI-101. In Aim 1,
we will dissect the link between RBM10 loss, DDR activation and STING-mediated NFκB signaling and we will
assess the contribution of altered R-loop homeostasis and alternative STING splicing to these phenotypes. In
Aim 2, we will comprehensively characterize the composition, signaling pathways and functional properties of
the RD TME in preclinical models in order to identify critical mediators of immune evasion and we will validate
key findings in NSCLC clinical specimens. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine the impact of RBM10 inactivation
on the clinical efficacy of ICI using clinical outcome data/specimens from patients enrolled in two phase 3 clinical
trials of durvalumab with or without tremelimumab versus platinum-doublet chemotherapy for previously
untreated metastatic NSCLC as well a phase 3 clinical trial of nivolumab/ipilimumab. In addition, we will evaluate
co-targeting STAT3 in combination with anti-PD-(L)1 in order to enhance the efficacy of immune checkpoint
blockade in RD-NSCLC. Clinical significance: This work will examine a novel link between splicing dysregulation
and immune evasion that is mediated by STING and will further seek to develop precision combination
immunotherapy approaches for RD NSCLC. The strength of our assembled multi-disciplinary team of experts
will facilitate rapid translation of discoveries into clinical advances for NSCLC patients."

The Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) system is an expert-knowledge,
machine learning, predictive model (CONCERN-PM) that produces an early warning score (CONCERN-EWS)
and is implemented as clinical decision support (CONCERN-CDS) to alert nurses and physicians about
hospitalized patients who are at risk of decompensation. CONCERN-PM leverages nursing documentation
patterns as a proxy measure of nurses’ decisions to increase surveillance and related interventions which are
an indicator of nurse concern about hospitalized patients – a key early indicator of decompensation. This five-
site observational implementation study is a renewal to our successful National Institute for Nursing
Research (NINR) funded R01, in which we developed and evaluated the CONCERN (Communicating
Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs) predictive model and clinical decision support (CDS) for hospitalized
patients in a multi-site randomized controlled clinical trial, with interim results of a 27% reduced likelihood of
inpatient mortality for patients whose clinicians received the CONCERN CDS intervention versus those who
did not. CONCERN-CDS alerts clinicians that a patient is at risk 42 hours earlier than leading EWS1. In this
renewal R01, we will conduct a five-site observational implementation study to evaluate fairness and
population validity of the CONCERN-PM, ecological validity of the CONCERN-CDS, and explore the
contribution of caregiver generated data to the performance of the CONCERN-PM as the next phase in
our multi-site nursing data science and implementation science program. EWS are in broad use at health
systems nationally, however, we have identified a lack of research findings demonstrating external validity and
fairness in other leading EWS.2 We will leverage 5 diverse study sites to test fairness, population validity, and
ecological validity across rural, suburban, and urban settings. The evaluation will be informed by the RE-AIM
(Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) and CFIR (
Consolidated Framework for
Implementation Research)
implementation science frameworks. The specific aims of this R01 Renewal are to:
Aim 1. Translate the CONCERN-PM to 2 additional specialty patient populations (emergency department and
inpatient pediatrics) and with the addition of social determinants of health (SDOH) data to evaluate model
calibration and performance across different patient populations and health systems; Aim 2. Evaluate
CONCERN-CDS implementation across all adult inpatient units at 5 health systems, in inpatient pediatric units
at 3 health systems and in the emergency department at 2 health systems to understand health system and
patient population characteristics associated with a successful implementation using RE-AIM and CFIR
Frameworks, and Aim 3. Using a patient-centered design approach, explore the creation of a patient-facing
CONCERN-PM and CDS for caregivers of inpatient pediatric patients, to compare predictive model
performance with additional caregiver feedback to the clinician-only data-driven model."

Despite advances in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), only 20–30% of patients achieve long-term
disease-free survival (DFS) and treatment options for relapsed AML are extremely limited. The recurrence of
AML has been attributed to leukemic stem cells (LSCs) and efforts are now focused on targeting this drug
resistant population of cells in order to “cure” AML. Our studies measuring energy metabolism in primary human
AML specimens, using reactive oxygen species (ROS) as an indicator of metabolic activity, revealed that LSCs
preferentially reside in a ROS-low state. Furthermore, high levels of activated 5' AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), a central regulator of metabolic pathways, were detected in the LSCs and that knockdown of AMPK
resulted in increased ROS levels and concomitant loss of LSCs. Based on these findings, we propose that AMPK
inhibition will leverage LSCs out of the ROS-low state decreasing their viability which may be sufficient for LSC
elimination or may sensitize them to conventional therapy. There are few potent and selective AMPK inhibitors;
however, the multi-kinase inhibitor sunitinib has been reported as a potent inhibitor of AMPK kinase activity.
Therefore, the central goal of our research is to develop potent and selective oxindole-based AMPK-targeted
agents and examine the effect of AMPK inhibition or degradation in AML models. We have developed an initial
series of oxindoles and although we identified potent AMPK inhibitors from this initial series, we believe further
AMPK selectivity and inhibitory potency is possible. We will use computational-based modeling to guide the
development of inhibitors and evaluate their AMPK inhibitory activity using in vitro kinase assays. Then, inhibition
of cellular AMPK will be determined by measuring the phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC) by ELISA in MOLM13 and MOLM14 cells, and select inhibitors will be submitted for kinome
profiling (Aim 1). AMPK inhibitors that retain an aminoalkyl side-chain extending out of the ATP-binding site will
be coupled to a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degrader and their ability to degrade cellular AMPK will
be evaluated. The oxindole-based AMPK inhibitors or degraders that have a terminal dimethylamino group that
interacts with the DFG motif of AMPK will be modified to incorporate a nitroimidazole hypoxia-activated prodrug
moiety that are designed to introduce a tier of LSC selectivity (Aim 2). The effect of AMPK inhibitors and PROTAC
degraders on cell viability, metabolism and ROS levels as single agents will be determined in MOLM13 and
MOLM14 cells and in primary AML cells, LSCs, and normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Then, the effect
of AMPK inhibitors or degraders in combination with venetoclax will be determined in MOLM13 and MOLM14
cells and in primary AML cells. Finally, the effect of our AMPK inhibitors or degraders as single agents and in
combination with venetoclax will be evaluated using primary AML specimens transplanted into advanced in vivo
tumor xenograft models (Aim 3). The objective of these studies are to develop a range of chemical tools to
evaluate the role of AMPK in maintaining LSC viability and the therapeutic potential of targeting AMPK in AML."

There is a growing body of evidence that smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypic transitions play an important
role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, there is still little understanding of molecular mechanisms
responsible for these transitions in vivo. Recently, we found that the embryonic stem cell/induced pluripotency
stem cell (iPSC) factor OCT4, which was believed to be silenced in somatic cells, plays an atheroprotective role
in SMC, in that genetic inactivation of Oct4 in SMC led to marked increases in lesion size and multiple indices of
plaque instability in Apoe‒/‒ mice. While we showed that OCT4 is required for SMC migration and investment
into the protective fibrous cap, we also have evidence that its loss in SMC was associated with SMC transition
toward a macrophage (MФ)-like state, including increased MФ marker expression, lipid accumulation, and
phagocytosis. Given the difficulty in overexpressing targeting iPSC factors, it is crucial to identify endogenous
molecular mechanisms responsible for OCT4 activation in SMC that can be potentially used to mediate beneficial
SMC-OCT4-dependent effects. It has been reported that activation of the innate immune Toll-like receptor
(TLR)/TRIF-dependent IRF3/NFkB signaling is required for efficient reprogramming to iPSC, as well as in cell
trans-differentiation to other cell lineages by driving epigenetic plasticity of cells. While mechanisms and the
critical role of the innate immunity in the progression of atherosclerosis are well characterized in the immune
cells, virtually nothing is known about the role of TLRs in the phenotypic transition of SMC in atherosclerosis.
Our data demonstrate that TLR4 signaling is responsible for hydroxymethylation of the Oct4 promoter and
reactivation of Oct4 in SMC. Intriguingly, Oct4 deficiency in SMC, in turn, up-regulates Tlr4, and leads to
dysregulation of both classical TLR4-downstream mechanisms, including MyD88-dependent (NFkB-mediated
inflammatory response) and TRIF-dependent (IRF3/LXRa-mediated cholesterol efflux), in vitro and in vivo. In
addition, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq analysis on specimens isolated from mouse atherosclerotic
arteries identified Tlr4 as a putative target of OCT4. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of TLR4-
signaling in SMC both upstream and downstream of OCT4. Our central hypothesis is that TLR4 signaling
mediates atheroprotective changes in SMC by regulating levels of the pluripotency factors OCT4 via a feedback
mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that TLR4
signaling regulates levels of OCT4 in SMC via a feedback mechanism. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that TLR4
signaling in SMC is atheroprotective. This Aim will utilize genetic and pharmacological approaches to define the
role of TLR4 signaling in SMC at different stages of atherosclerosis. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the up-
regulation of TLR4 in Oct4 deficient SMC promotes SMC transition toward МФ-like state. These studies will
establish for the first time the mechanistic connection between innate immunity and pluripotency factors in SMC
and provide insight into the role of TLR4 in SMC phenotypic transition."

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) impact a large percentage of the population with enormous financial and
social costs, and effective drugs for management of LUTS are limited. Purinergic signaling is a prominent
dysregulated pathway, which has been consistently reported in LUTS. While purinergic contractility is minimal
in normal human bladder, it increases significantly in bladders of human patients, to more closely resembles
documented rodent physiology. However, the underlying mechanism which results in these functional pathway
alterations is not known. To study this, we have identified multiple novel functional purinergic receptors and
modulators in bladder. We have demonstrated that purinergic signaling is not only important for contraction in
bladder wall, as mediated by ATP/ADP activated P2X1/P2Y12 signaling, but is also important for bladder
relaxation mediated by adenosine activated A2b receptor signaling. Furthermore, A2b receptor mediated
relaxation signaling can completely inhibit P2X1/P2Y12 mediated contractions. By comparative studies, we have
defined a key gene - ENTPD1 (also known as CD39) – that is differentially expressed in human and mouse
bladders (~ 8-fold higher in normal human bladders than in mouse). ENTPD1 is a rate-limiting enzyme
converting ATP/ADP/AMP sequentially. ENTPD1 controls the kinetics of an agonist cascade
(ATP>ADP>adenosine), and hence plays a critical role in the control of purinergic receptor expression and
function. Interestingly, human ENTPD1 mutations have been identified in autoimmune diseases and
neurodegenerative disorders, and LUTS is a prominent symptom in these diseases. Consistent with this,
impaired ATP hydrolysis has been reported in bladder tissues from LUTS patients. Therefore, we hypothesize
that ENTPD1 is a key regulator in bladder function. In support, we have preliminary data from a global Entpd1-
/- mouse, indicating that deletion of Entpd1 results in a dilated bladder with abnormal voiding phenotype. We
will test our hypothesis through the following aims: (1) We will generate a visceral smooth muscle specific
Entpd1 knockout mouse model to demonstrate the critical importance of ENTPD1 in regulating normal detrusor
contractility and bladder function; (2) We will use two ENTPD1 mutant mouse models with high and low
ENTPD1 expression levels to mimic human bladders that are normal (high) and diseased (low), and then
examine voiding function/dysfunction; (3) Through the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI)
network, we will procure human bladder tissues, and study the expression and function of ENTPD1 in the
bladders of both sexes. We will solve the puzzles of why there are purinergic contractile differences between
human and rodent bladders, between male and female human bladders, and between normal and diseased
human bladders. We expect this study to substantially advance our understanding on how bladder contraction
and relaxation is controlled by ENTPD1 and its associated purinergic signaling. These studies have high
potential to introduce novel therapies for human LUTS patients as there are multiple targetable options."

The gut microbiota is a critical determinant of human health and development. Diets rich in the refined sugars
glucose and fructose can modulate gut microbial abundance and metabolism thereby increasing disease
susceptibility. However, the mechanisms governing microbial responses to dietary sugar in the gut remain poorly
understood. We have demonstrated that host dietary sugar consumption silences expression of a colonization
factor called Roc in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an abundant gut bacterium associated with lean, healthy
individuals. We determined that a conserved transcription factor is necessary to synthesize Roc and regulates
additional bacterial factors that mediate critical host-microbial interactions, including an immunomodulatory
protein and fucose utilization genes. We hypothesize that the activity of this transcription factor is governed by a
putative intracellular metabolite that is differentially synthesized according to host diet composition and
dramatically reduced upon sugar-rich diet consumption. We have identified critical molecular players governing
the activity of this transcription factor and propose to 1.) elucidate the mechanisms governing its activation, 2.)
determine how dietary sugar consumption silences its activity, and 3.) characterize the consequences of host
sugar-rich diet consumption on microbial product synthesis in vivo. We believe that this work will reveal a
conserved pathway that is disrupted by host sugar consumption resulting in aberrant gut microbial activities.
Furthermore, this work has uncovered a molecular target for modulation of microbial abundance and metabolism
in the host and can be exploited for rational manipulation of the gut microbiota to treat diseases."

Frequent binge drinking, and common pattern of alcohol (ethanol) consumption across the lifespan, has been
linked to numerous adverse consequences. Particularly concerning is the fact that regular binge drinking
significantly increases an individual’s risk of developing ethanol dependence. Thus, it is a highly significant goal
to identify neuronal mechanisms that modulate binge drinking as such knowledge will provide insight into novel
pharmaceutical treatments to help curb binge drinking and which in turn may reduce the risk of progressing to
more serious forms of alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Research aimed at the neurobiology of AUDs has focused
considerable attention to the reinforcing effects of ethanol and how these effects motivate binge-like ethanol
intake. Interestingly there is accumulating evidence that ethanol also entails aversive effects and that these
effects, because they are clearly dose related, can act as a deterrent to overconsumption. Because the
neurocircuitry underlying the aversive effects of ethanol is still poorly understood, in the last funding period we
began to characterize the neuronal mechanisms that modulate the aversive reactions to ethanol and their role
in modulating binge-like ethanol consumption. We found that binge-like ethanol drinking increases the activity of
neurons in the A2 (caudal nucleus of the solitary tract; NTS) and A6 (locus coeruleus; LC) brainstem regions,
two of the primary sources of norepinephrine (NE) that send afferent projections to numerous brain structures
that modulate motivated behaviors. Interestingly, we discovered that chemogenetic activation of NE+ circuits
from the LC to the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) or the A2 to the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN),
target regions that have been implicated in modulating the aversive properties of ethanol, significantly blunted
binge-like ethanol intake in mice. Further, activating the NE+ LC  RMTg circuit induced unconditioned aversive
behaviors in mice, and silencing this pathway attenuated ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA). Our
guiding hypothesis is that activation of these NE+ circuits trigger a protective mechanism to “break” ethanol
intake by promoting aversive responses to ethanol. More recently, we observed NE circuits arising from the LC
and A2 that directly innervate the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain region critical for modulating both reward
and aversion. Surprisingly, there has been almost no investigation into the role of NE signaling in the VTA in the
modulation of ethanol intake or the aversive properties of ethanol. Proposed experiments logically flow from the
original grant but will significantly advance our understanding of the novel mechanisms under investigation by 1)
revealing novel NE+ circuits that modulate binge-like ethanol intake and the aversive properties of ethanol, 2)
identifying the adrenergic receptors (AR) that are involved, and 3) identifying neuroplastic changes in AR
expression on specific populations of neurons in RMTg, PBN, and VTA resulting from repeated cycles of binge-
like ethanol intake. As the mechanisms and NE circuits under investigation have received little attention with
respect to neurobiological response to ethanol, the proposed studies are highly novel and innovative."

While immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the landscape of cancer treatment paradigm, the
response rate is limited to a small subset of cancer patients (~20%). For colorectal cancer (CRC), the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths in US, only patients (~4%) with mismatch-repair-deficient or microsatellite
instability-high tumors can respond to ICIs, leaving the vast majority of CRC patients with limited to no clinical
benefit. Chemotherapy has been increasingly manifested to contribute significantly to the overall antitumor
efficacy when combined with ICIs via switching the tumors from “immune-cold” to ‘immune-hot’. However, owing
to the poor solubility and pharmacokinetics, limited tumor accumulation, and non-specific toxicities to healthy
tissues, the utility of chemotherapeutics in enhancing the efficacy of ICIs has been considerably hindered. To
render a safer and more efficacious chemotherapy-enabled immune response to cooperate with ICIs, our long-
term goal is to develop an innovative and multifunctional liposomal nanotherapeutic platform via conjugating
anticancer agents to the backbone phospholipid of liposome. We have developed a phospholipid-derived
camptothecin (CPT) liposome (Camptothesome) nanoplatform, which significantly prolonged blood circulation
time, enhanced tumor uptake and therapeutic efficacy and minimized systemic toxicities compared to free CPT.
Moreover, Camptothesome potentiated the anti-CRC efficacy of PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors, resulting in partial
eradication of tumors in immunocompetent mice. To improve the efficacy of this combined therapy, we used
Camptothesome to co-deliver an inhibitor targeting another independent immune checkpoint, Indoleamine 2,3-
dioxygenase (IDO1), which markedly enhanced anti-CRC efficacy and immunity. To further strengthen the
delivery efficiency and explore the potential of this nanoplatform in enhancing PD-L1/PD-1 blockade therapy, in
this proposal we will:
Aim 1: Improve the Camptothesome system for enhanced therapeutic delivery.
Aim 2: Determine the tumor delivery efficiency and pharmacokinetics of the improved co-delivery system
in murine CRC models.
Aim 3: Define antitumor effects of the improved co-delivery system with or without PD-L1/PD-1 blockade
in murine CRC models. The mechanistic action for the in vivo antitumor efficacy and immune responses of the
combined therapy will also be elucidated. Successful completion of this proposal will result in an innovative and
multifunctional nanotherapeutic platform for improved and safe CRC immunochemotherapy. Moreover, given
that IDO1 is expressed in diverse cancer cells, and the broad applicability of this nanoplatform to other anticancer
drugs, our combination nanotherapeutic system has the potential to revolutionize cancer treatment paradigms."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a broad range of related neurodevelopmental disorders that are expressed
within the first 2 to 3 years of life as stereotypic behaviors, and language and social-emotional impairments.
ASD affects about 1 in 59 children in the United States and carries a high economic cost to families and
communities. While there is a contribution of heredity, a growing body of research suggests that ASD has
origins in utero. Specifically, evidence is accumulating that prenatal inflammation is a critical exposure in the
causal pathway of at least a subset of ASD. Notably, this exposure may operate through sex-dimorphic effects
on the placenta on fetal brain development, consistent with the high ASD risk for males relative to females. In
our community-based hospital population, unique due to mandated universal placental histopathology
assessment and linkage to pediatric community care, pilot analyses identified a 3-to-7-fold increased risk of
childhood ASD associated with prenatal exposure to acute and/or chronic inflammation (AI, CI). This marker
was seen in ~25% of low-risk children eventually diagnosed with ASD. These inflammatory placental
pathologies were not marked by any maternal signs or symptoms during pregnancy. In addition, we identified a
13-fold increased odds of ASD risk with placental villous maldevelopment (PVM).
 We propose here to test pathways from these placental histopathology diagnoses to eventual ASD
diagnosis. We will begin with targeted formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) placental histopathology of AI,
CI, and PVM. We will then employ detailed and quantitative immunophenotyping of placental-decidual tissue at
the placental-maternal interface. We can thoroughly profile cell type, cell function markers, and inflammation
activation/apoptosis targets at the same time by using computer-assisted deep learning that allows precise
tracking of immunolabeling and minimizes concerns of label overlap that can confound interpretation of
immunofluorescent preparations. We will next assess newborn circulating levels of cytokines, chemokines, and
growth factors, alterations of which are known to impact neurodevelopmental processes key to the genesis of
neuronal dysfunction manifested in ASD. We will also examine epigenetic pathways by assessing DNA
methylation in the placenta and its link to inflammation and PVM. Our analyses will test these as pathways
from placental/decidual tissue markers of inflammation and/or PVM to ASD diagnosis.
 No other ASD case-control sample in a community-based population has universal access to FFPE tissue.
This proposed project will open a unique window on the prenatal environment underlying ASD. Clarification of
the pathways operating in community-based ASD will elucidate the mechanisms involved in ASD risk."

Psychoactive substances provide temporary feelings of euphoria, but also elicit multifold harm to the human
body. Areca (betel) nut is the 4th most common abused substance worldwide, only behind alcohol, caffeine,
and nicotine. Though AN chewing is traditionally recognized abroad, emerging evidence demonstrates use
within migrant and refugee communities in the US. Despite global popularity, there is a dearth of knowledge
about how the predominant psychoactive and toxic substance in the nut, arecoline, is metabolized and the
biological consequences if its metabolism is perturbed by other substances. Ethanol is commonly co-abused
with AN, and significantly their combined ingestion is associated with greater patient harm for reasons yet to be
determined. Our supporting data demonstrate that ethanol inhibits arecoline metabolism, suggesting arecoline
accumulation will occur in the blood and brain tissue – a highly significant toxicokinetic interaction. We have
also identified that L-menthol is present in commercialized (branded) AN products sold in the US, and our
preliminary findings show menthol deters arecoline hydrolysis. Taken together, the long-term goal of this
project is to improve the health of AN substance abusers. The overall objectives in this application are to (i)
confirm human hydrolase(s) and tissue site(s) catalyzing hydrolysis of arecoline; (ii) characterize a newfound
ethanol drug interaction with arecoline; and (iii) distinguish changes in arecoline's pharmacokinetic profile and
neurobiological activity following co-ingestion with L-menthol, a substance of emerging concern in branded AN
products. The central hypothesis is that arecoline is subject to metabolic inhibition when combined with ethanol
or L-menthol leading to increased toxicity and greater CNS effects. The central hypothesis will be tested by 3
specific aims: 1) Establish the predominate contribution of human esterases and tissue sites that hydrolyze
arecoline; 2) Dissect the influence of ethanol on arecoline disposition; and 3) Elucidate the pharmaco-
neurological significance of menthol in commercialized AN products. The aims will be accomplished by an
interdisciplinary team with varied expertise in trace drug analysis, carboxylesterase drug metabolism,
biomimetic 3D organoid systems, special knock-out mouse models, and drug addiction. Male and female mice
will be used throughout the aims to assess sex as a biological variable. Ultimately after 5-years, we expect to
be the first to demonstrate arecoline is predominantly metabolized in the liver by carboxylesterase-1 (CES1),
an enzyme we anticipate catalyzes transesterification of arecoline in the presence of ethanol, forming a unique
metabolite with toxicological properties. Further, we anticipate L-menthol combined with arecoline will provoke
arecoline buildup in brain tissue and modify the neurobiological profile and psychoactivity in mice, a brand new
pharmaco-neurological interaction. Findings in conglomerate will advance insight about AN addiction, and yield
a scientific foundation for implementing strategies to lessen this psychoactive substance's toxic burden."

This proposal describes the synthesis, characterization, and thorough evaluation of the first
supramolecular hybrid hydrogel burn dressing. Our design goals are a) on-demand dissolubility -for easy
trauma-free removal from burn wound-, b) integrated antimicrobial activity - for infection management-,
and c) self-healing – for problem-free application and use. Burn injuries are one of the most prevalent,
devastating, and demanding critical care problems, worldwide. Nearly every minute, someone in the US
sustains a serious burn injury, and each day over 300 children visit emergency rooms and 2 of them die
due to burn injuries. Millions, globally, suffer from burn-related disabilities with heavy psychological,
emotional, and economic consequences on the survivors and their families. Burn dressing removal is
reportedly the time of most pain (after the burn itself), and opioids are the primary treatment for such
pain. The burn dressing change for a typical injury with intensive care unit level care is at least 57.6
minutes. The time and complexity of the process further grow with the frequently applied anesthesia.
Importantly, repeated painful dressing changes and wound infection cause a higher predisposition to life-
threatening sepsis and multi-organ failure. Currently available burn dressings – used clinically – adhere
to the wound surface and are surgically or mechanically debrided from the wound. This results in the
traumatization of newly epithelialized tissues, delayed healing and severe pain. We, thus, propose to
create a supramolecular hybrid hydrogel combining the host-guest chemistry (cucurbituril [7]-hosted
cationic copolymer) with inorganic components (i.e., clay) (Aim1). The unique feature of this hydrogel will
be its high biocompatibility and ability to be dissolved on-demand via adamantane/diamantane
derivatives, easily and quickly removed and eliminate debridement. This will reduce extreme pain and
suffering (by drastically reducing time of pain). The proposed hydrogel will also be embedded with
antibiotics to reduce bacterial infection. We will test this hydrogel through both in vitro (mouse and human
cells, Aim 2) and in vivo (mouse, Aim 3) and preclinical (swine, Aim 3) experiments. Overall, our goal is
to promote better burn wound healing, deter infection and provide pain-free burn care for patients, in line
with the mission of NIAMS. This project falls under the umbrella of regenerative medicine (wound healing,
tissue repair, regeneration) and treatment of large-area acute skin wounds (burns and trauma)
highlighted in the NIAMS Strategic Plan for FY 2020-2024. The project also focuses on a) improving the
patient experience (reducing pain), and b) treating co-occuring conditions of burn wounds and infections,
two focus areas of NIAMS."

Sexual minority women (SMW) experience disproportionately high risk of sexual assault (SA) and resulting
mental health sequelae (e.g., depression, PTSD), and these sequelae appear to be especially pronounced
among Black SMW. The main theoretical model of sexual minority mental health disparities (i.e., the minority
stress model) attributes this elevated risk to climate-level factors (e.g., laws, policies, and other conditions that
afford risk or protection to minoritized groups) that vary across municipalities and states. Indeed, evidence
suggests that climate-level factors are associated with risk for PTSD and other disorders in sexual minorities.
However, nearly all studies to date have relied exclusively on assessments of individual-level perceptions of
climate-level factors, and no studies have directly tested these climate-level factors in relation to SMW’s mental
health following SA. This proposal therefore aims to test the minority stress model in relation to SMW’s SA
recovery, including the first-ever direct test of the role of climate-level factors, to inform novel interventions and
policy change efforts. We will recruit a geographically-stratified sample of 2400 SMW aged 18-35
(oversampling Black SMW) to complete self-report surveys every 6 months for 2.5 years, and use publicly-
available population-level data on SMW and Black-relevant policies/laws and community presence to
characterize the climates of participants’ municipalities and states. Aim 1 will involve testing cross-sectional
baseline differences in mental health as a function of history of adolescent/adult SA and climate-level
variables. Because the mental health effects of SA are most evident in the first 6 months following SA, Aims 2
& 3 will focus on the subsample of SMW (approximately 33%) who experience a prospective SA during the
study. Aim 2 will test mediated relationships between climate-level variables, individual-level SMW minority
stress, and rates of mental health symptom change in prospectively-assaulted SMW. Aim 3 will apply a
critically-needed intersectional lens to these questions by testing the relationship of anti-Black climates to rates
of recovery in prospectively-assaulted Black SMW. Combining these self-report and population-level datasets
over multiple years provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate how sociopolitical environments
influence health disparities while the disparities are emerging. Given persistent health disparities among SMW,
identifying contributing factors across varying levels of causation is important for public health, both for SMW,
and also for other minoritized groups. We will draw upon our team’s extensive expertise in SMW research and
practice and utilize SMW advisory to carry out this study. Results of this study will immediately inform clinical
interventions to improve recovery from SA among this highly vulnerable group and help to prioritize and justify
public policy changes to reduce this mental health disparity."

styles on patient comprehension of the concepts that were intended to be conveyed in the
illustration or patient anxiety induced by the illustration. In this effort we will first develop a domain
ontology that systematically describes the space of medical illustration styles in current use. We
will then use this ontology to guide the creation of a public domain corpus of patient education
documents that exhibit the most important illustration distinctions identified in the ontology, along
with knowledge tests for each. This corpus will be used to conduct an evaluation involving 8,100
individuals to assess the impact of different illustration styles on comprehension and anxiety.
Finally, we will explore the use of Embodied Conversational Agents that simulate face-to-face
conversation with a health provider, to explain patient education documents, both on 2D displays
and in immersive Virtual Reality, evaluated in a randomized study involving 300 participants."

A key step in the assembly of the large double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses is packaging of a
genome into a pre-assembled procapsid by an ATP-driven motor complex. In the herpesviruses
and many bacteriophages, packaging is catalyzed by a terminase enzyme that utilizes a
concatemeric genome substrate. To accomplish this, terminase enzymes assemble into distinct
initiation, motor and termination complexes to processively excise an individual genome from the
concatemer, and concomitantly package it into the capsid. This requires that the enzymes cycle
between stable nuclease and dynamic motor intermediates. While our understanding of
packaging initiation and motor translocation is extensive, termination of genome packaging
remains ill-studied and poorly characterized in all viruses, primarily because defined experimental
systems have not been developed. Phage  is an exception wherein rigorous biochemical assays
allow molecular dissection of the entire assembly pathway. This multi-PI application proposes
to use phage  to interrogate termination, the final and most poorly characterized step in the
packaging pathway. Two fundamental questions central to genome packaging are addressed; (i)
how does the translocating motor recognize the genome end while also sensing that a sufficient
length of DNA has been packaged, transition to a site-specifically bound nuclease complex, and
(ii) how do “finishing proteins” promote end maturation and terminase ejection from the
nucleocapsid without loss of the tightly packaged DNA. We describe highly integrated and
synergistic biochemical, biophysical, single-molecule and structural approaches to characterize
this conserved and essential, yet largely unstudied step in virus assembly. Given that this process
is strongly conserved in all of the dsDNA viruses, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, and the
commonality of initiation-translocation-termination pathways in biology, the results will have broad
implications in virology and cell biology."

Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a major source of blindness worldwide. These diseases are typically
single-gene disorders that result in the degeneration of photoreceptor cells. Historically they have been
classified based on the clinical phenotype and electrophysiological results, and then grouped into various
disease entities. In the past three decades the genetic basis of many forms of inherited retinal diseases have
been discovered leading to the identification of over 270 retinal disease genes. Importantly, the field of
medicine and vision science has resulted in an FDA-approved viral mediated gene therapy for IRD associated
with mutations in RPE65. Children with this condition are treated with AAV carrying RPE65 delivered to the
macula in the subretinal space at the time of vitrectomy. Many other single gene disorders affecting the retina
are currently being targeted in various clinical trials, mostly through similar strategies to deliver virus to the
macula through the subretinal route. Viral mediated gene therapy administered in this fashion is limited by
treatment of only the macular area. Furthermore, it requires intraocular surgery, detachment of the macula
from the retinal pigmented epithelium, and carries the risk of sight-threatening surgical complications. Recent
studies have demonstrated progressive macular atrophy (retinal cell death) at the site of the subretinal bleb in
~15% of patients receiving this gene therapy within the first year after treatment, suggesting subretinal gene
therapy may ultimately cause more harm than good. Therapeutic administration via the intravitreal route is
much less invasive, takes place in a clinical setting, and can potentially be repeated to achieve maximal
therapeutic effect. However, intravitreal viral mediated gene therapy can be associated with increased
inflammation. In addition, native AAVs do not penetrate the retinal layers to transduce photoreceptors
efficiently. In this study, we will take advantage of non-human primates with a mutation in PDE6C, a key
component of phototransduction, causing electrically silent cone photoreceptors. With a proven effective
therapeutic AAV-PR1.7-PDE6C vector in hand, we will compare the efficacy of AAV delivered via the
subretinal vs intravitreal route to rescue cone function. Furthermore, we will compare inflammatory reaction
between these contexts, determine the active components of the immune system, and define the role of pre-
existing anti-AAV antibodies in host animals. We will measure the degree to which the route of delivery and
inflammation affects the physiologic rescue. This proposal will advance the field of intravitreal gene therapy for
inherited retinal diseases. The aims of this proposal will determine the efficacy of intravitreal compared to
subretinal gene therapy, the role of pre-existing circulating antibodies in the host that may mitigate the efficacy
of treatment, and the degree to which ocular inflammation affects the visual rescue. Together, the aims of this
study will advance the understanding of intravitreal gene therapy and its relationship with ocular inflammation
and treatment efficacy."

Patients’ health expectations lie at the foundation of their preference-sensitive choices, such as whether to
pursue comfort-oriented therapies as a primary or concurrent strategy. To achieve high-quality shared decision
making, patients with serious illnesses must form accurate expectations for their future health. However, many
patients have inaccurate expectations, limiting their ability to make decisions concordant with their values.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an incurable lung disease of older adults and a leading
cause of death worldwide. Patients with COPD and their caregivers frequently experience a high burden of
symptoms, mood disorders, and difficulty coping, yet underuse advance care planning and palliative
treatments. Existing evidence reveals that patients with COPD are at risk for expectation inaccuracies and our
preliminary work reveals that overly optimistic expectations are associated with worse quality of life over time.
Our overarching objective is to promote the well-being of patients living with COPD through the delivery of care
concordant with individual patients’ values. This work proposes a novel application of behavioral theories of
decision making and innovative methodologies to the common problem of goal-discordant care. This is a
prospective cohort study among 420 patients with severe COPD plus their family caregivers recruited from
Wake Forest Baptist Health, Geisinger Health System, and the University of Pennsylvania Health System.
These three health systems represent diverse communities, including rural and Black communities where
COPD is disproportionately burdensome, and have robust research infrastructures. The specific aims of this
study are to: 1) identify patient and caregiver characteristics associated with inaccurate health expectations, 2)
quantify associations between patients’ and caregivers’ expectation accuracy and well-being, and 3) identify
mechanisms through which clinician communication influences expectation accuracy.
The study team has the requisite content expertise, methodological expertise, and prior success conducting
investigations of this type. Completion of this project will provide mechanistic insights into ways to promote
optimal shared decision making in serious illness using state-of-the-art methods to test a novel conceptual
model. This work will result in key targets for intervention development to improve expectation management
and decision making among patients with serious illness."

The goal of this proposal is to describe a five-year training and mentorship plan to prepare Drew Schwartz, MD,
PhD to become an independent physician-scientist investigator studying the effects of antibiotics on the preterm
neonatal microbiome and host response. Dr. Schwartz obtained combined MD and PhD degrees in the Medical
Scientist Training Program at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis where he studied how
uropathogenic E. coli invade bladder cells to cause severe urinary tract infections. After clinical training in
Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases at Washington University School of Medicine and St. Louis Children’s
Hospital, he joined the lab of Dr. Gautam Dantas, PhD, a renowned expert on the microbiome and antibiotic
resistance. Using fecal samples from an established repository of over 70,000 stools from hospitalized neonates,
Dr. Schwartz developed a novel gnotobiotic mouse model of infant microbiome development and disruption. He
colonizes germ-free dams with neonatal stool and treats microbiota-humanized pups with clinically relevant
doses of antibiotics. He has identified that specific microbiome-antibiotic combinations result in mouse death
concomitant with microbiome disruption and immune dysregulation. The central hypothesis is that antibiotic
treatment predisposes infants with certain microbiome and resistome compositions to either bacteremic or
culture-negative late-onset sepsis. The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) Define the effects of early-life
antibiotics on human infant microbiome maturation, gut mucosal immune response, and vulnerability to
bacteremia, and 2) Determine microbial and immune mechanisms of bacteremic and culture-negative late-onset
sepsis in a neonatal microbiome-humanized mouse model. The proposed studies will utilize microbiome
sequencing, flow cytometry, host immune profiling, and computational modeling to identify modifiable risk factors
to refine antibiotic prescribing in the neonatal intensive care unit with the overall goal of reducing incidence and
mortality from late-onset sepsis. The mentor, Dr. Dantas, will primarily oversee the project providing training on
microbiome analysis, resistome sequencing, and bioinformatic modeling. Dr. Schwartz has assembled an
advisory committee with expertise on neonatal infections, antibiotic treatment, gut microbiome development and
disruption, and mucosal and peripheral immune response to commensal and pathogenic bacteria. The training
plan incorporates achievement of technical expertise, grant writing skills, responsible conduct of research, and
mentorship through one-on-one learning, University-sponsored workshops, and presentation and workshops at
international conferences. Washington University School of Medicine is the ideal training environment given its
extensive track record, outstanding resources, commitment to physician scientists, and necessary expertise to
complete the proposed research. This K08 award will provide the necessary skills and resources that Dr.
Schwartz requires to become a successful physician scientist whose lab studies the infant microbiome host

10857279,"Abstract
 During pathophysiological conditions characterized by extensive hemolysis (e.g. acquired and genetic
hemolytic diseases), free heme and cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) are released into the blood stream and elicit a
variety of adverse effects, namely: vasoconstriction, hypertension, and end organ damage. Thus treatment of
hemolytic conditions would benefit from scavengers of free heme and cell-free Hb such as hemopexin (Hpx) and
haptoglobin (Hp), respectively. A possible functional alternative to Hpx is apohemoglobin (apoHb). ApoHb is
derived by removing heme from Hb, and its vacant heme-binding pockets have a high affinity for heme. Hence,
apoHb could serve as a novel in vivo heme scavenger instead of Hpx.
 However, major potential issues with the use of apoHb as an in vivo heme scavenger are its low thermal
stability at physiological temperature, and short circulatory half-life (similar to Hb, 5 min). Fortuitously, previous
studies have shown that, similar to Hb, apoHb can bind to Hp forming a highly stable complex. The apoHb-Hp
complex retains its ability to bind heme, and is more stable at physiological temperature compared to free apoHb.
In addition to being able to bind free heme, the apoHb-Hp complex can scavenge free Hb by exchanging Hp
bound apoHb αβ dimers for Hb αβ dimers. Therefore, we hypothesize that the apoHb-Hp complex will have
the dual ability to bind and detoxify free heme and Hb that are produced during states of hemolysis. The
resulting Hb-Hp complex is much less toxic than free heme or cell-free Hb and is readily cleared from circulation
via CD163 mediated monocyte/macrophage uptake. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific
aims.
Specific Aim 1: Biophysical and biochemical characterization of the apoHb-Hp complex and its ability to
bind heme and Hb in vitro.
Specific Aim 2: In vivo determination of heme and Hb transfer and binding to apoHb-Hp.
Specific Aim 3: Systematic pre-clinical evaluation of apoHb-Hp to prevent and/or halt the progression of
intravascular hemolysis (Hb/heme)-induced pulmonary cardiovascular disease.
Specific Aim 4: Microvascular evaluation of apoHb-Hp to prevent vaso-occlusion and reduce vascular
inflammation."
10907545,"Project Summary: Tobacco-related deaths are rising rapidly in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In
India alone, tobacco use accounts for over 1.2 million deaths each year. Reducing these deaths will require
large-scale implementation of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that promote tobacco use cessation.
However, given the limited reach and logistical challenges of conducting in-person training to implement
tobacco-control EBIs, new models are needed that can be implemented more broadly, flexibly and at low cost.
Until such robust tobacco-control EBIs are implemented and scaled, tobacco-related mortality will continue to
rise. Our long-term goal is to identify effective, low-resource strategies to promote broad-based implementation
of tobacco-control EBIs in LMICs. This study builds on an intervention for schoolteachers, called the Tobacco
Free Teachers, Tobacco Free Society (TFT-TFS) program, shown to be efficacious in increasing tobacco use
cessation in a cluster-randomized trial. Teachers in India are an important channel for promoting tobacco
control, given their roles as community leaders and role models. A critical next step in this research, which is our
objective here, is to compare the implementation and effectiveness of the TFT-TFS program when delivered
through in-person training verses a smartphone-based training model. Use of smartphones in educational
settings is already pervasive in India offering a readily available, low-cost strategy for expanding training on the
TFT-TFS program. By delivering TFT-TFS training through smartphones, the potential reach of the program
can be multiplied over what can be achieved with in-person training. We will conduct a comparative
effectiveness trial using a cluster-randomized design in which headmasters of schools in the Indian state of
Madhya Pradesh will be randomly assigned to receive in-person training or training via smartphone for the
TFT-TFS program. Once trained, headmasters in both groups will implement the TFT-TFS program within their
schools. We will compare the training arms in terms of program implementation, effectiveness, cost, and reach.
This Hybrid III study will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and RE-AIM
Framework; we will use mixed methods to analyze factors contributing to outcomes. Accordingly, our specific
aims are to: (1) develop in-person and smartphone-based training models based on systematic assessment of
contextual factors in Madhya Pradesh; (2) compare program implementation fidelity, effectiveness, and cost for
the two training models; and (3) identify factors affecting program implementation after in-person vs.
smartphone-based training using a mixed-methods design. This project is innovative by shifting the status quo
from costly, time-intensive, in-person training to a smartphone-based training model to scale up tobacco
control EBIs. The proposed research is significant because it introduces a new approach for reducing tobacco
use and related deaths and demonstrates how training via smartphone can be applied to scaling other public
health-related EBIs in resource-constrained areas."

The primary goal of the proposed research is to build an optimized intervention to promote sustained viral
suppression among a group of Latinx people who inject drugs and who are living with HIV on the U.S.-Mexico
Border. We are using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST). MOST is an engineering-inspired
framework for designing and building optimized interventions. The primary aim is to conduct a 2-to-4 factorial
design where participants are randomized to zero or up to four intervention conditions (each condition
comprises a different set of intervention components). The four components are receiving (or not receiving)
peer support services for medication-assisted treatment (MAT) uptake and persistence, behavioral activation
therapy for depression (BAT), Life-Steps medication adherence program, and patient navigation for HIV care.
The intervention is being implemented at Programa Compañeros, a community-based social service
organization in Cuidad, Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico, a city nestled alongside El Paso, Texas. Participants will
complete a baseline survey assessment, complete their assigned intervention programs, and then return for 6-
,9-, and 12-month follow-up assessments. The primary outcome is sustained viral suppression defined as viral
load test results of <400 copies per mL on all 6-,9-, and 12-month follow-up visits. Results of Aim 1 will yield
estimates of the unique impact of each intervention component, as well as each combination of components,
on sustained viral suppression. The research team and partners will make decisions about what constitutes the
optimized intervention by judging the observed effect sizes and statistical significance against real-world
constraints that go into the delivery of this intervention. The secondary aims are to test theoretical mediators to
explain the influence of the intervention components on viral suppression outcome and moderators of this
relationship. We will first test the effect each component exerted at the first, 6-month, follow-up assessment,
followed by testing characteristics that may modify this relationship."

While the vast majority of antiviral efforts to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) focus on essential viral proteins, emerging evidence shows that conserved viral RNA (vRNA) structural
elements are compelling targets with the potential for pan-antiviral activity. Despite this promise, however,
selective targeting of RNA using drug-like small molecules remains challenging. In particular, methodologies for
screening small molecule libraries against RNA remain underdeveloped, and do not adequately address the
central problem of target specificity. As a result, RNA-targeted screens often fail to yield efficacious compounds.
The proposed study takes direct aim at this technological gap through the development of a novel RNA-targeted
screening technology using L-aptamers composed of mirror-image L-DNA. The PI previously established that L-
aptamers can be evolved to bind native D-RNA structures, including SARS-CoV-2 vRNAs, with high affinity and
selectivity. He now proposes to develop L-aptamers into RNA-specific competitive displacement probes for
identifying small molecules with analogous properties. The general utility of nucleic acid aptamers, combined
with the unique RNA-binding properties of L-aptamers, impart the proposed L-aptamer-displacement assay with
several advantages over current RNA-centric screening technologies, and is hypothesized to facilitate the
discovery of small molecules with unprecedented RNA-binding capabilities.
 The PI has already prepared an L-aptamer targeting a conserved RNA element with the SARS-CoV-2
genome, which will be developed into a biochemical assay that couples competitive displacement of the L-
aptamer from the vRNA target with an optical readout (Aim 1). Using this assay, the PI will initiate a high-
throughput screen to identify potent ligands targeting the corresponding vRNA. The most promising lead
compounds will be evaluated for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (Aim 2). Parallel efforts will
be undertaken to generate L-aptamers against additional SARS-CoV-2 RNA structures (Aim 3), which will be
shuttled through this same pipeline.
 Successful completion of this project will signify a major advance in the area of RNA-targeted drug discovery.
While combatting SARS-CoV-2 is the immediate goal, technologies developed herein are readily adaptable to
target any RNA virus. By targeting essential RNA structures that are conserved across β-coronaviruses, the PI
envision that this approach will allow for identification of antiviral compounds with broad-spectrum activity that
might quickly pivot to address future outbreaks."

Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) is the 6th commonest cancer in the world,
leading to >300,000 deaths annually worldwide. The extracapsular extension (ECE) of the tumor in the
lymph nodes is a significantly high-risk feature in head and neck cancers. Several studies demonstrate
that ECE results in worse survival outcomes. Pathologic confirmation, such as neck dissection, is
currently required as the gold standard for clinical identification of ECE. However, if it is ECE positive,
postoperative chemoradiotherapy has to be considered. As a result, neck dissection followed by
chemoradiation increases the toxicity, especially late toxicity such as fibrosis, and lymphedema can get
worse due to the late toxicity. If we can detect ECE during preoperative evaluation, we can select those
patients for chemoradiation before surgery. Thus, predicting ECE becomes a piece of critical
information for clinicians planning treatment. The biggest obstacles to adopting AI/ML algorithms in the
clinic are concerns about security, reliability, and transparency. If an algorithm could be developed to
not only provide an accurate prediction of ECE (and/or clinical staging), but also to provide transparent
and clinically understandable communication of how the predictive conclusion was reached, then
clinicians would more readily adopt a tool utilizing that algorithm to be an ally. The purpose of this
proposal is to optimize and pathologically validate AI/ML approaches for prognoses and diagnoses of
ECE from medical images on head and neck cancer patients, which could be further implemented as a
tool for diagnostic assistance and precision medicine. This translational research project focuses on
filling the gap of AI/ML transparency and interpretability in the automated detection of ECE in head
and neck cancers. In addition, our interpretable ML algorithm will not require the pre-annotated lymph
node areas, which is a quite cost-effective technique by eliminating the time-consuming lymph node
annotation process. We propose the following aims: 1) Validate and interpret the image-based ECE
diagnosis model and its association with head and neck cancer anatomic organ sites and HPV status.
2) Optimize the cost-effective image-based ECE diagnosis model considering clinical markers within
pathology, PETCT, and MRI results for clinical implementation. We will validate our model based on the
dataset collected from both our team and existing data collected from The Cancer Image Archive. This
proposal aligns with the mission of Oral & Salivary Cancer Biology Program and the NIDCR Special
Interest in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic, Computational, and
Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006). This study will provide the preliminary results of our
future research on the precision treatment of high-risk head and neck cancer patients. We plan to
submit an NIDCR R01 proposal in Year 2 for the precision treatment of high-risk head and neck cancer."

This proposal outlines an investigation into the role of chromatin-tethering proteins in maintenance of peripheral
heterochromatin and the integrity of nuclear lamina. It is well established that heterochromatin association with
the nuclear lamina plays an important role in development, and contributes to maintenance of the adopted cell
fate. Genetic mutations in lamina proteins, such as is seen in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), is
associated with alterations in the morphology of the nuclear lamina and disruption of peripheral heterochromatin.
However, the precise link between nuclear lamina mutations and heterochromatin positioning remains unclear.
I propose to test if the chromatin-tethering protein PRR14 plays a critical role in this process and therefore
functions in the premature aging pathway. Our data demonstrate that PRR14 organizes a significant fraction of
heterochromatin at the nuclear lamina. Lack of PRR14 results in detachment of the peripheral heterochromatin
from the nuclear lamina, while PRR14 overexpression substantially increases the fraction of heterochromatin
located at the nuclear periphery. Previous findings implicate PRR14 as an epigenetic repressor and its loss can
release transcriptional gene silencing. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that PRR14 loss results in nuclear
lamina defects similar to those observed in diseases associated with nuclear lamina mutations. Here we propose
to study the role of PRR14 in maintenance of chromatin organization at the nuclear lamina and assess how
nuclear lamina mutations act through PRR14 to cause dysregulation of lamina-associated chromatin. We will
determine the effect of PRR14 loss on heterochromatin organization at the nuclear lamina and define epigenetic
features that mark genome regions for nuclear lamina localization via PRR14. Further, we will determine how
nuclear lamina mutations affect the PRR14 function in organizing chromatin at the nuclear lamina by testing how
Progerin (a mutant form of Lamin A protein) affects the PRR14-nuclear lamina interaction and triggers nuclear
lamina and peripheral heterochromatin defects. Finally, to determine if PRR14-nuclear lamina association is
affected by farnesyl group modification on Progerin, we will test whether farnesyltransferase inhibitors restore
PRR14 function in tethering heterochromatin in HGPS cells. Our work will provide critical insights into the
fundamental knowledge of chromatin association with the nuclear lamina. This would significantly advance our
understanding of molecular mechanism behind nuclear lamina and genome organization defects observed in
laminopathy diseases."
10879161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) bind to both coding and non-coding RNA to influence every step of the RNA life-
cycle, including pre-mRNA processing, RNA localization, and control of translation and degradation. More and
more evidence reveals that disruption of RNA metabolism is a hallmark of many human neurodegenerative
diseases including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Understanding how RBPs act in coordinated networks to
regulate RNA fate is key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms underlying these disease pathologies. A
complete catalogue of human RBPs is elusive due to the emergence of new classes of RBPs that interact with
unpolyadenylated pre-mRNAs or non-canonical RBPs that lack characterized RNA-binding domains, and thus
evade traditional RNA-interactome capture studies. We developed a computational RBP classifier based on
the observation that protein-protein interaction networks that depend on co-binding of RNA molecules can be
used to discover new classes of RBPs. This proposal seeks to utilize predictions from this classifier to
accomplish 3 main goals.
 1. Phase 1: Determine the biological function of RNA-binding by the disease-associated non-canonical
 nucleocytoplasmic transport related candidate RBP RANGAP1.
 2. Phase 2: Determine the biological function of RNA-binding for an expanded group of disease-
 associated non-canonical nucleocytoplasmic transport related candidate RBPs.
 3. Phase 2: Build an RBP centered protein-protein interaction network to expand the repertoire of human
 RBPs to characterize ALS relevant higher order RNP complexes.
My extensive experience in the study of DNA and RNA binding proteins makes me an ideal candidate to
perform the research proposed here. These aims will build towards the completion of a comprehensive list of
human RBPs that will help provide detailed maps of RNA regulatory networks. The Yeo lab at UCSD is a
leader in the field of RNA biology, and therefore is an excellent environment to perform the proposed training
and build an independent research program. The Yeo lab is situated at the heart of a major biomedical
research hub at UCSD, adjacent to the Salk Institute, and other research institutes and biotechnology
companies in La Jolla. Conducting the proposed training program here will give me access to leaders in stem
cell biology and proteomic methods that I hope to master as I transition to independence."

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a primary risk factor for glaucoma, which affects over 66 million people
worldwide. Lowering IOP remains the only effective therapeutic strategy to stop the progression of glaucomatous
vision loss. The trabecular meshwork (TM) is the primary site of IOP regulation, but few outflow drugs specifically
target the TM, the site of pathology. The newest class of glaucoma drugs, Rho kinase inhibitors, inhibit the Rho-
ROCK pathway to disassemble actin stress fibers. However, recent studies failed to detect stress fibers in human
ex vivo TM tissue. Thus, the exact biological mechanisms of how Rho kinase inhibitors lower IOP remain unclear.
Instead, cortical actin networks predominate in situ. Since Rho GTPases regulate cortical actin, Rho kinase
inhibitors may target cortical actin. This is an unexplored research avenue in the TM. Contractility of cortical
actin, which sits just beneath the cell membrane, exerts tension and produces a mechanical force that drives
changes in cell shape such as invaginations and cellular protrusions. In this application, we will focus on the
relationship between cortical actin, the plasma membrane and ECM as it pertains to two TM cellular protrusions:
filopodia/tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) and podosome and invadopodia-like structures (PILS). We will investigate
whether the `picket-fence' model of membrane organization influences filopodia/TNTs. In this model, the
membrane is compartmentalized by transmembrane `picket' proteins, e.g. CD44, which are anchored
extracellularly and to sub-membrane intracellular “fences” (cortical actin). `Picket-fence' molecules `corral' other
transmembrane proteins, such as integrins, into membrane compartments. In Aim #1, we will test whether
manipulation of actin-binding proteins and/or CD44 `picket' proteins will lead to local disassembly of the cortical
actin `fence' to initiate TNT formation. Effects will be determined by super-resolution confocal microscopy, TNT
vesicle transfer assays, live TM cell imaging and CD44 phosphorylation assays. The effects of specific actin-
binding protein inhibitors on outflow regulation in perfusion culture will be investigated to evaluate their potential
to modulate IOP. Aim #2 will investigate plasma membrane tension and integrin activation in normal and
glaucomatous TM cells. Differences in cell membrane tension will be measured using a Flipper-TR fluorogenic
probe and integrin activation state will be determined using conformation-specific antibodies. This will provide
novel information on how membrane tension influences transmembrane receptor activation. Finally, in Aim #3,
we will investigate Myosin-X, an actin-binding protein that is a component of PILS. We will investigate the role of
Myo10 in coordinating integrins and matrix metalloproteinase activity at these degradative complexes in TM cells
at rest and when subjected to mechanical stretch, and in TM tissue of human anterior segments perfused at 1x
and 2x pressure. Understanding the molecular machinery influencing cellular protrusions (filopodia/TNTs and
PILS) will provide novel insights into the role of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in IOP regulation, will revise our
current understanding of how Rho kinase inhibitors lower IOP and may lead to new glaucoma therapies."
10867474,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Treatment of genetic disorders by in utero transplantation (IUTx) has safely been performed for decades in
humans. The first IUTx cure, in the US, used hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and corrected a child with X-SCID.
Since this groundbreaking moment >25 yrs. ago, >50 patients have now been treated with this procedure for 14
different genetic disorders. However, for reasons that are still not well understood, full therapeutic success has
only been achieved in X-SCID patients. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which HSC
engraftment is hindered after IUTx is required, so that strategies can be developed to achieve therapeutic levels
of HSC engraftment in other genetic disorders, such as hemoglobinopathies, that could benefit from IUTx. We
and others have identified several characteristics of the developing fetus that may negatively impact its ability to
serve as an amenable HSC recipient. Among these factors are competition from highly proliferative host HSC,
more significant fetal immune barriers than initially known, and the degree of maturity and receptivity of nascent
BM niches required for engraftment of donor (adult) HSC. Here, using fetal sheep as a model, we propose to:
(Aim1) define the nature of, and overcome, the barriers to engraftment by using non-genotoxic conditioning to
dissect the role that niche availability, host HSC competition, and fetal immunity play in the engraftment of adult
donor HSC following IUTx, and (Aim 2) determine the impact of the phenotype and functionality of the donor
HSC on the levels of engraftment following IUTx. We hope that, upon completion of these first 2 Aims, we will
not only have identified the mechanisms involved in resistance to HSC engraftment, but we will also have
achieved a minimum target of 20-25% HSC engraftment, which would allow IUTX to become a viable therapeutic
approach for hemoglobinopathies. Among these, sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood
disorder in the US, and one of the diseases that could benefit from IUTx, since even though the fetus is protected
from sickling by the presence of fetal hemoglobin (Hb), clinical manifestations of SCD start during early infancy,
placing the child at risk of complications such as stroke, splenic crisis, pain episodes, life-threatening infections,
and episodes of acute chest syndrome, which can cause permanent lung damage. Of direct relevance to SCD,
sheep exhibit the same developmental pattern of fetal to adult Hb switching as humans. Recently, using CRISPR/
Cas editing and subsequent somatic cell nuclear transfer, we produced SCD sheep with a disease phenotype
mirroring that of human patients, displaying sickled cells in blood smears, positive Hb solubility test, and HbS
detected by Hb electrophoresis. In Aim 3, we propose to validate the sheep SCD model by monitoring the
animals over time, determining the stressors that induce sickle cell crises, and defining acute and chronic disease
complications. In addition, we will test the therapeutic efficacy of IUTx for treating/curing SCD. Upon completion,
we hope these studies will contribute to the development of novel strategies to achieve curative levels of HSC
engraftment after IUTX and will validate a highly clinically relevant model for the SCD community in general."

Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth
restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies
successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over
$20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a
lack of understanding of the cell populations responsible for scarring and their molecular dynamics. Studies in
recent years have reported that adipocytes in wounds are capable of transitioning into fibroblasts (and vice
versa); however, the extent to which adipocyte-to-fibroblast transition contributes to wound fibrosis (scarring),
and whether this process can be targeted to prevent scarring, remain unknown. In this proposal, we explore for
the first time the role of tissue mechanics in conversion of dermal adipocytes to scarring fibroblasts within the
wound environment. First, employing genetic lineage tracing, we will use histology, immunohistochemistry, and
flow cytometry to study adipocyte-to-fibroblast transition and to interrogate the molecular phenotype of adipocyte
lineage-derived fibroblasts within wounds. Second, we will use a Rainbow mouse model to interrogate clonal
dynamics of adipocyte-to-fibroblast transition in wounds, and will apply an integrated multi-omic analysis, with
single-cell transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and epigenomic (scATAC-seq), spatial transcriptomic (Visium) and
proteomic (CODEX), and quantitative extracellular matrix (ECM) ultrastructural analyses, in order to robustly
define the molecular drivers and pathways involved in adipocyte-to-fibroblast conversion during scarring. Third,
as our preliminary data strongly support a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying adipocyte-to-fibroblast
transition during wound healing, we will inhibit mechanical signaling in adipocytes using both small molecule and
transgenic approaches in order to block adipocyte-to-fibroblast transition. We will apply a similar multi-omic
analysis to elucidate the molecular dynamics that differentiate wound adipocyte dynamics in the context of intact
versus blocked mechanical signaling and determine how inhibiting mechanically driven adipocyte-to-fibroblast
conversion may reduce fibrosis and yield wound regeneration. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop
therapeutics that target fibrogenic wound cell dynamics to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the
proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of
cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the contributions
of adipose tissue to wound fibrosis."
10885160,"Members of the Multi-drug Resistance Protein (MRP) family of ATP Binding Cassette (ABC)
transporters contribute to drug tolerance in major fungal pathogens, including Candida species, in 2 main
ways: 1) they detoxify the cell of cytotoxic molecules such as antifungal drugs and electrophiles/oxidants
by sequestering them in the vacuole, and 2) they cause complex morphological changes such as hyphal
extension and biofilm formation linked to drug tolerance. Because of their role in these survival
mechanisms, MRP family members are often required for infection and are tightly regulated by the cell.
The overall objective of this proposal is to bridge gaps in our understanding of how these transporters
contribute to the increasing threat of drug resistance in fungal pathogens. Mechanistic models that
explain this resistance are especially lacking, limiting antifungal treatment efficacy. The long-term goal is
to understand how anti-fungal treatments fail. To this end, we specifically focus on early stage anti-stress
responses through enzymatic, structural, and cellular investigations of two prominent vacuolar MRP
transporters: Ycf1 and Mlt1. Our rationale is that these insights will provide a foundation for exploiting
unique aspects of transporter architecture in order to generate more effective therapies that overcome
drug tolerance in fungal infections.
 Our preliminary work identifies key features of MRP family transporter regulation during fungal stress
responses. These are complex substrate binding sites and the regulation of different states of an
intrinsically disordered region called the Regulatory-domain (R- domain) by phosphorylation. Our central
hypothesis is that MRP transporters are governed by domain insertions outside of the conserved
transporter fold that regulate multi-segmented substrate binding sites. Our specific aims testing this
hypothesis in MPR transporters are to define: (1) the regulatory architectures adopted across transport
cycles, (2) the functional and structural roles of R-domain phosphorylation on catalytic regulation, and (3)
the molecular basis of substrate selection and lipid transport in membrane homeostasis.
 This application uses an innovative multidisciplinary approach that applies advances in membrane
protein biochemistry and electron cryo-microscopy to structurally and biophysically undercharacterized
fungal integral membrane proteins. In light of the growing threat of Candida infections, the significance
of our proposal is twofold. First, we will establish a mechanistic framework for understanding the
molecular basis of therapeutic failure driven by important Candida virulence factors and their yeast
homologs. Second, we will establish a foundation useful for developing allosteric therapeutics against
drug-tolerance linked to fungal MRP family transporters, with general applicability to all MRP transporters."

This proposal outlines a 5-year research and career development plan designed to support the candidate’s
trajectory towards an independent academic career. The proposed research project, which focuses on acute
myeloid leukemia (AML)-associated MYC mutations and their key target genes in AML cells, will capitalize
on critical expertise and resources available at Washington University School of Medicine. The career
development plan and didactic work will provide the candidate with a variety of skills that will enable a successful
transition to independence. This proposal is founded on our recent observation that a unique set of recurrent
MYC missense mutations are significantly enriched in the dominant clones of normal karyotype AML patients
who have very long first remissions (>5 years) with chemotherapy only; in our series, 6/6 MYC mutations co-
occurred with NPM1 mutations (NPMc), suggesting a unique form of cooperativity. Based on our preliminary
findings, we hypothesize that: 1) AMLs overexpressing WT or mutant MYC proteins are biologically different; 2)
each MYC mutation may have unique effects on its transcriptional targets; and 3) MYC mutations may cooperate
with NPMc mutations. To address these hypotheses, we propose the following specific aims:
Specific Aim 1: We will examine the function of AML-associated MYC mutations alone, or in cooperation
with NPMc. We have developed a doxycycline-inducible system that allows us to regulate Myc expression in
hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) that do or do not contain the Npmc mutation. Using this
system, we will evaluate how WT or mutant Myc, with or without Npmc, impacts AML development, progression,
and AraC responsiveness both in vitro and in vivo. We are also developing a more physiologic, conditional
knock-in model of MYCT58N (a recurrent mutation both in AML and B cell malignancies) that will allow us to
explore the influence of physiologic doses of mutant Myc and Npmc on AML pathogenesis and AraC sensitivity.
Specific Aim 2: We will define the transcriptional outputs and genomic binding sites of WT vs. mutant
Myc proteins in AMLs arising in WT vs. Npmc mice. To identify Myc dysregulated genes, we will use scRNA-
seq to determine the transcriptional profiles of AMLs (obtained in Aim 1) initiated by WT vs. mutant Myc over-
expression, either alone or in combination with Npmc. We will also perform ChIP-seq studies to characterize the
genomic binding sites of WT vs. mutant Myc, and perform an integrated analysis of these datasets to define the
relative contributions of direct vs. indirect effects of Myc on transcriptional outputs in AML cells. By combining
the results of the functional studies (Aim 1) with the expression and DNA binding studies (Aim 2), we hope to
better understand how Myc mutations alter transcription in hematopoietic cells, and how Npmc affects this output.
If these studies are successful, they may provide important insights on MYC-mediated transformation, refine our
current predictive tools for AML risk stratification, identify pathways involved in AraC sensitivity, and allow us to
create new approaches for the treatment of AML patients."
10876301,"Project Summary
Despite widespread use of a vaccine, infection with the bacterium Bordetella pertussis continues to claim the
lives of ~200,000 infants annually worldwide and cause significant morbidity and mortality in developed countries,
including the US. To develop improved vaccines and therapeutics, we need to better understand how this
organism causes disease and identify new vaccine antigens. The adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT) is a leading
candidate for inclusion in future pertussis vaccines. ACT is a large (1706 residue), bi-functional toxin with a cell-
invasive domain fused to a pore-forming repeat-in-toxin (RTX) hemolysin domain. The RTX domain is composed
of five blocks of ~8 nonapeptide motifs separated by linkers of different length and sequence. ACT efficiently
targets leukocytes by binding αMβ2 integrins via a site localized to the RTX domain. Receptor binding triggers
translocation of the 40 kDa N-terminal adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane where it rapidly
converts nearly all intracellular ATP to cAMP, thereby compromising phagocytic and other leukocyte anti-
bacterial activities.
Although the general features of ACT function have been described, there are few data to support a molecular
understanding of any step in the intoxication process for ACT specifically or for RTX proteins more generally.
The structural features by which the RTX blocks mediate specific protein–protein interactions, such as receptor
binding, and the epitopes and mechanisms by which antibodies inhibit ACT function are not well defined. Our
panel of high-affinity antibodies that recognize neutralizing and non-neutralizing epitopes on ACT provide a
unique opportunity to address these questions. The long-term goal of this research is to understand structural
mechanisms of the complex cellular intoxication process used by the Bordetella adenylate cyclase toxin to
incapacitate immune cells. The specific objective is to provide a molecular description of the interaction of
ACT’s RTX domain with its receptor and with neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. This will provide
mechanistic insights into ACT function and define important vaccine targets such as epitopes susceptible to
antibody-mediated neutralization, the receptor-binding site, and pre-translocation conformations. Such
information is necessary for the implementation of rational design strategies that seek to more effectively present
such targets to the immune system. The expected outcomes include the first structures of an RTX protein
containing more than two repeat blocks and the first RTX–antibody and RTX–receptor structures. We will also
evaluate structural pathways for RTX antibody escape and species specificity and the impact of such changes on
cellular toxicity of the intact ACT protein and bacterial infection using a mouse model. Since there are currently
no structural data defining antibody or receptor epitopes for any RTX protein, this work will transform our
understanding of this class of bacterial toxin and provide insight into a key pertussis virulence factor."
10829464,"ABSTRACT
Over the past three decades, there has been an alarming increase in the incidence of childhood obesity.
Childhood obesity leads to early onset of cardiovascular risk factors, and both obesity and cardiovascular risk
factors track into adulthood and contribute to the epidemic of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Developmental
Origins of Health and Disease theory posits that risk for obesity and CVD is, in part, programmed in utero. To
prevent this early entrenchment into obesity and CVD, identification of modifiable maternal factors during
pregnancy that later impact offspring risk in early childhood is essential. A surprising lack of research investigates
the role of prenatal sedentary behavior (SED), moderate-to-vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), and the
novel 24-hour behavior paradigm (the composition of SED, physical activity, and sleep) on these adverse
offspring outcomes. This is a critical research gap because there is strong physiological rationale that SED,
MVPA, and 24-hour behavior in pregnancy could influence offspring health, and these behaviors are modifiable
targets for intervention during pregnancy. The overall goal of this proposal is to examine the associations of SED
(Aim 1) and MVPA (Aim 2) across pregnancy with offspring obesity risk and CVD risk through 24 months. We
will also use novel statistical methods to determine the optimal 24-hour behavior compositions (Aim 3) during
pregnancy associated with reduced risk of these adverse offspring outcomes. We can achieve these aims by
leveraging our ongoing, multi-center cohort study Pregnancy 24/7 (R01 HL153095), where we are prospectively
measuring SED, physical activity, and sleep in 500 women in each trimester of pregnancy using state-of-the-art
monitors (activPAL3 micro and Actiwatch Spectrum Plus). Pregnancy 24/7 also assesses other relevant prenatal
exposures that may associate with offspring obesity and CVD risk, i.e., pre-pregnancy obesity, gestational weight
gain, diet, smoking, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. In direct response to the NHLBI’s Notice of Special
Interest (NOT-HL-19-695), we propose to expand Pregnancy 24/7 by conducting a separate cohort study among
the offspring of its participants. In the Offspring Study, we propose to combine maternal exposure data from
Pregnancy 24/7 with new, comprehensive assessments of postnatal exposures, obesity, and CVD risk measures
in the child through 24 months via medical record abstraction, questionnaires, and an in-person study visit at 24
months. We hypothesize that offspring of women with higher SED or lower MVPA across pregnancy will have
more rapid increases in BMI Z-score (primary outcome), and greater adiposity, blood pressure, and pulse wave
velocity through 24 months. Further, we hypothesize that statistically reallocating time in SED to physical activity,
but not sleep (among adequate duration sleepers) will be associated with more optimal offspring outcomes. By
combining prenatal and postnatal exposure data, our approach uniquely allows us to isolate the effects of
pregnancy SED, MVPA, and 24-hr behavior on offspring obesity and CVD risk measures in early childhood. This
project will inform critically needed primordial prevention interventions to decrease the risk of obesity and CVD."
10866513,"With each recurrence, the prognosis for Bipolar Disorder (BD) worsens and the risk for suicidality and substance
abuse increases, indicating the need to identify and manage the factors associated with recurrence risk. Factors
associated with recurrence risk for the group as a whole have been identified, however, the question of how to
predict recurrence risk for an individual with BD remains unanswered. Since the course of BD is heterogenous,
the ability to predict recurrence risk at the person level would allow treatment to be tailored to the specific
individual. As in other fields of medicine, we developed a risk calculator (RC) that predicts with approximately
80% discrimination the 1-5 year risk of any mood recurrence and the polarity of the recurrence in youths/young
adults with BD. Given that the RC must be externally validated before it can reliably be used in clinical practice,
the Predicting Recurrence of Mood in Patients with BD (PROMPT-BD) study proposes to externally validate the
RC in BD youth/young adults. The existing RC (termed “distal” RC) is valuable, but only predicts long-term (1-5
year) recurrence risk and not proximal risk (i.e.1-4 weeks). Predicting proximal risk could enable prompt
intervention upon detection of “warning” signs, potentially improving the course of BD. To do this, factors
associated with impending recurrences in BD such as sleep-activity rhythms, mobility, and digital social
interactions will be measured continuously in real-time using smartphone passive sensing and subsequently
combined with clinical predictors from the distal RC to further enhance prediction. In contrast to self-reports,
passive sensing can assess continuous changes in behavior over extended periods without requiring participant
input. While actigraphy is the “gold standard” for assessment of sleep-activity rhythms, it is not feasible for
participants to wear a research-grade activity monitor for the duration necessary for risk prediction of mood
recurrences. Thus, we will examine how passive sensing-based assessments of sleep-activity data map onto
actigraphy by collecting actigraphy data for five 2-week periods over follow-up (intake and at each follow-up).
We will also explore if development and sex influence passive sensing measures of interest. To carry out this
proposal, 120 BDI/II individuals (14-25 years old) who are currently in remission will be recruited. Clinical
assessments will be administered at intake and 6,12,18, and 24-months. Sleep-activity rhythms (e.g. phone
usage, accelerometer), mobility (e.g., GPS), and digital social interaction (e.g. phone communication log), will
be continuously evaluated via smartphone passive sensing, yielding over 300 days of data per participant
(>30,000 days combined across the sample). Finally, to more precisely identify the timing of recurrence and to
temporally anchor retrospective mood assessments, participants will complete a brief weekly questionnaire for
mood prompted via text message. PROMPT-BD findings will be instrumental in counseling patients and their
families regarding proximal risk for recurrence and long-term prognosis and have great promise for informing the
future development of individualized treatments and both clinical and biological studies."
10864969,"Exposure to early life adversity (ELA) confers significant risk for psychiatric disorders that are often
unresponsive to traditional treatments. Importantly, most ELA-attributable psychopathologies involve
heightened responsivity to potential threats, yet our mechanistic understanding of this susceptibility
remains incipient due to insufficient knowledge about how experience, sex, and age interact to affect the
development of threat-responsive circuits. Thus, this project aims to identify causal mechanisms initiated
by ELA that drive heightened corticolimbic connectivity and enhanced threat responsivity. Our long-term
goal is to enable translation of these findings into individualized intervention strategies. Our groups have
shown that ELA leads to development of heightened anatomical (innervation) and functional (BOLD;
local field potential) connectivity between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
in early adolescence, as well as higher anxiety-like behaviors. Several of these effects emerged earlier in
females than in males, and our preliminary findings suggest that pubertal sex hormones may impact the
sex-specific development of BLA-PFC connectivity following ELA. We will therefore test the central
hypothesis that ELA disruption of peri-pubertal BLA activity and hormonal signaling accelerate
development of BLA-PFC connectivity in a sex-specific manner, altering PFC-regulated threat
responsivity across the lifespan. Our studies will first use electrophysiological and chemogenetic
approaches to reveal sex-specific critical periods of BLA activity that drive hyper-connectivity with the
PFC (Aim 1), enhanced responsivity to potential threat (Aim 1), and glutamate receptivity in the PFC
(Aim 2). Aim 3 will investigate a peri-pubertal neuroendocrine mechanism using RNA silencing to
determine whether estrogen receptor signaling in the BLA drives hyper-connectivity to the PFC,
glutamate transmission in the PFC, and heightened threat responsivity. Together, these studies will fill
critical gaps in knowledge about the developmental and sex-specific nature of ELA effects on BLA-PFC
circuitry and are expected to have significant impact on the development of specific targets for prevention
in ELA-exposed populations."

The sustained global impact of the viral pandemics of HIV and SARS-CoV-2 and the challenges to the
management and prevention of disease require the training and development of talented new researchers.
Since 1990, we trained postdoctoral scholars in this program at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD).
The program is designed to produce new investigators who are capable of independently leading impactful
research in basic and translational viral biology and pathogenesis. This application proposes renewal of this
highly successful training program. Based on our strategic planning process, we propose an expansion in the
program’s scope to better reflect the research priorities of the Office of AIDS Research and to respond to the
challenges of viral pandemics like COVID-19. Specifically, the program’s priorities will include reducing incidence
(including vaccination), therapeutics and cure, health disparities, and long-term comorbidities. To reflect this
expansion, we propose a new leadership structure, have grown our faculty to 23 mentors who have an extensive
history of independent research, collaborations, and training. We have renamed the application to reflect these
changes, HIV and Other PandEmics, or HOPE. We have also added 10 mentors-in-development (MiDs), who
are an internal talent pool from which a new generation of mid-career mentors for the HOPE Training Program
will develop over time. The faculty are committed to identifying talented and committed postdoctoral trainees and
to providing the environment and opportunities that will support their path to independence in medically relevant
basic, translational, clinical, and epidemiological research.
The program will retain its successful educational and training elements, while incorporating innovative new
offerings to address one of the greatest challenges facing modern medicine and public health, SARS-CoV-2.
The research interests and activities of our faculty support the evolving focus and priorities of virology research
in general and specifically within our program. We propose to support six postdoctoral trainees for a training
period of two to three years each. We aim to continue to improve on our success in training underrepresented
minorities and women. Through our program of closely mentored, trainee-driven research, interactive research
review, and career development activities, our overarching goal remains to prepare the next generation of
scientists for highly productive careers in biomedical research with local, national and international impact."

There is growing awareness of the importance of sex differences in auditory function and disorders. Large-scale
clinical studies have revealed a strong sex bias in hearing loss prevalence. While females have a lower overall
prevalence of hearing loss, 8.3 million women have hearing impairment, and 1.67 million begin experiencing
hearing loss during their middle age. Hearing loss in females worsens after menopause. Moreover, female
hearing levels are more variable, suggesting disease conditions that affect subpopulations of females, increasing
their vulnerability to certain otologic disorders. Autoimmune disorders preferentially affect women, leading to a
higher prevalence of immune-related hearing impairment. Female-related hearing loss typically begins around
the middle age and affects the low- and mid-frequencies essential for perceiving speech. At present, the
underlying mechanisms for female hearing loss are poorly understood. The lack of understanding has prevented
the development of diagnostic tools to determine the underlying causes of sex-dependent susceptibility to
hearing loss. We recently identified a lectin family protein, galectin-3, in the cochlea. This β-galactoside-binding
protein has been involved in various biological processes, including immune functions. It also has a vital role in
inflammatory disorders. Our pilot observations have shown that galectin-3 is highly expressed in cochlear
immune cells and supporting cells, both being immune-competent cells. This protein participates in cochlear
inflammatory responses to age-related and noise-induced hearing loss. Our analysis revealed that targeted
disruption of galectin-3-coding gene, Lgals3, increases female susceptibility to age-related cochlear
degeneration. Identification of galectin-3 as an important sex-relevant immune molecule provides us with a
powerful tool to investigate the role of immune-mediated activities in female auditory dysfunction. The long-term
goal of our research is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences in otologic disorders.
The proposed research aims to use galectin-3 as a gateway to identify female-linked molecules and determine
how these molecules interact with female hormones to affect female cochlear homeostasis and susceptibility to
hearing disorders. Specifically, we will 1) determine the role of galectin-3 in maintaining auditory function and
cochlear integrity, 2) determine immune mechanisms underlying the female susceptibility to galectin-3
deficiency, and 3) determine female hormonal regulation of cochlear gene expression. Our proposed study will
address a clinically relevant but still understudied research topic, female hearing loss. Identifying molecules
critical to female hearing has great potential for clinical translation. The knowledge gained from the proposed
studies can guide future efforts to identify female essential molecules in human ears, which will aid in identifying
clinically applicable biomarkers for revealing the underlying causes of female hearing loss. Ultimately, studying
the biological basis of sex differences will provide the foundation for developing sex-dependent therapies for
hearing loss."

There is tremendous interest in cannabis (as smoked marijuana or CBD- or THC-dominant extracts) as a
therapeutic modality for a variety of health indications (including chronic pain). Given the complexity of
cannabis, however, we have little insight into its mechanisms of action in complementary and integrative health
approaches. Specifically, there is a prevailing notion that the 100+ cannabinoids and the various
terpenoids/flavonoids that comprise cannabis act in concert to create an “Entourage Effect”. A comprehensive
analysis is required to better understand the potential of cannabis agents as complementary medicines. We
herein propose a novel artificial intelligence-driven approach to address this gap in our knowledge.
Not surprisingly, a natural product (e.g., cannabis) that is active in an organism typically works because it acts
like endogenous ligands or those known to the organism. We hypothesize that deconstructing ligand
structures into specific fragments will allow us to identify targets that bind endogenous tergets containing such
fragments. Moreover, we believe that disparate compounds acting in concert will maximally engage selective
pathways. We have developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven platform, DRIFT (drug-target identification
based on chemical similarity), to map ligand compounds (cannabinoids and terpenoids) to molecular targets.
Thus, we can illuminate involved cellular pathways, and predict physiological response. We will use DRIFT to
profile compounds in a number of different cannabis extracts (e.g., high in CBD, CBG, or THC) with varying
analgesic properties to identify therapeutic combinations and their relevant targets. We will undertake three
specific aims. In Specific Aim 1, use DRIFT for massive mapping of cannabis constituents to corresponding
target proteins. Then, in Specific Aim 2, we will extend the DRIFT platform by evaluating binding affinities
between metabolites and their proteins using a new neural network paradigm (NeuralDock). We will use text
mining techniques to mine compound-protein relationships from PubMed. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will
experimentally validate the outputs of the DRIFT platform to predict mechanisms of cannabis on pain. We will
test the AI-based results using traditional pharmacology tools and a variety of preclinical animal models of
pain. These same models will then be employed to test mechanisms through the complementary use of
agonists, antagonists, inhibitors and (where appropriate) gene knockouts to validate mechanisms.
When these studies are successful, we will have validated DRIFT as a new and valuable AI tool for studying
natural products. Moreover, we will provide important insights into the growing use of cannabis in
complementary and integrative health."

Neurons are able to restore their activity when challenged by external or internal perturbations. This form of
homeostatic response is crucial for the maintenance of neuronal or network stability during development and
normal brain function. During homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP), chronic suppression of neuronal activity
leads to a compensatory increase in synaptically localized AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and the intensity of
synaptic currents. Under basal conditions, AMPARs exist as GluA2-containing heterotetramers, mostly in the
form of GluA1/GluA2 or GluA2/GluA3. The GluA2-containing AMPARs are permeable to sodium but
impermeable to calcium. The resistance to calcium derives from a unique posttranscriptional modification of
GluA2 mRNA. Editing of adenosine to inosine by the adenosine deaminase enzyme ADAR2 switches a
glutamine (Q) to arginine (R) in GluA2, which confers calcium impermeability in AMPARs. Thus, inefficient
editing of GluA2 mRNA, or a lack of incorporation of GluA2 in an AMPAR channel complex, will lead to
calcium-permeable AMPARs (Cp-AMPARs). While the role for the Cp-AMPAR has been well recognized as
a key signaling molecule in HSP, the molecular nature and mechanisms regarding the biogenesis of the Cp-
AMPAR in HSP remains largely unknown. We hypothesize that during HSP, neuronal inactivity triggers
cellular responses in the location and activity of the ADAR2 enzyme, leading to unedited GluA2 and the
formation of GluA2(Q)-containing Cp-AMPARs. Also, the molecular substrates of the Cp-AMPAR calcium
cascade that are involved in homeostatic responses remain unknown. We hypothesize that Cp-AMPAR
activity leads to GluA1 acetylation which enables AMPAR synaptic accumulation, leading to the expression
of homeostatic plasticity. In this proposal, we aim to examine the molecular details underlying the regulation
of GluA2 editing for the biogenesis of Cp-AMPARs, as well as the subsequent modification of AMPARs by
acetylation and their contribution to the expression of homeostatic synaptic plasticity in vitro in primary
neurons and in vivo in the mouse visual cortex."

 Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) are a group of monogenic diseases caused by inborn errors of immunity
(IEI) that confer risk of severe infection, autoimmunity, and cancer. The genetic and immunological study of IEI
is instrumental to understand mechanisms of human immunity and to manage and treat patients with PIDs. Their
study is also important to understand more common diseases associated with genetic variants in the same
genes. However, despite the relevance and importance of studying PIDs from the basic science and clinical
points of view, half of the PID patients lack a genetic diagnosis. By studying a patient with a PID of unknown
genetic etiology that confers susceptibility to severe mycobacterial disease, we identified a nonsense mutation
in SERPINB1. Using a combination of population genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology, we showed that
this is the first case of SERPINB1 complete deficiency ever described. SERPINB1 is an intracellular serine
protease suicide inhibitor. Its absence in mice causes uncontrolled intracellular protease activity, leading to
neutrophil death and subsequent neutropenia. Interestingly, our patient does not display any neutrophil
abnormality, but instead, our in-depth immunological characterization showed a reduction in the frequency of
activated T cells and CD4+ memory T cells. Our findings suggest that SERPINB1 has a previously unknown
function in T cells and antimycobacterial immunity. Our data also indicates that SERPINB1 orchestrates an
intracellular protease-mediated pathway essential for T cell activation and survival. Given our findings, this
application will test the hypothesis that SERPINB1 is critical for human T cell activation and, by controlling
intracellular protease activity, to human diseases. Capitalizing on the unique opportunity that this patient offers
to understand the function of human SERPINB1, we propose three complementary approaches. In Aim 1, we
will characterize the immunological consequences of SERPINB1 deficiency on T cell activation and CD4+ T cell
differentiation. We will also study the transcriptional consequences of SERPINB1 deficiency in T cells. With this,
we will uncover a previously unknown function of SERPINB1 in human T cells. In Aim 2, we will identify and
characterize the pathways orchestrated by SERPINB1 in T cells. The absence of SERPINB1 unleashes the
action of intracellular proteases. This rare mechanism of PID will allow for chemical inhibition of these proteases
for therapeutic purposes. Furthermore, characterizing the SERPINB1-dependent antimycobacterial mechanisms
will lead to the identification of additional IEI in its pathway in patients lacking a genetic diagnosis. In Aim 3, we
will perform phenome-wide association studies (pheWAS) to identify associations between genetic variants in
the SERPINB1 pathway and additional human diseases. This reverse genetic approach will expand what we will
learn from the study of a rare disease to benefit a broader group of patients. Our proposed research has far-
reaching clinical and biological implications for understanding SERPINB1 mediated immunity, PIDs, anti-
mycobacterial immunity, and the contribution of the SERPINB1 pathway to human disease."

 The proper functioning of essentially all cells is due in part to spatially defined regions that are
populated by specific proteins to perform specific activities. Neurons, due to their elongated size and
morphology, must deal with large distances when navigating protein localization with regard to axons and
dendrites. This problem is solved by transporting RNA molecules to specific locations within neurons. When
these RNA molecules are translated, they immediately produce correctly localized proteins. The importance of
this key process is evidenced by multiple neurological diseases that are associated with its misregulation. The
RNA-binding protein TDP-43 is known to be involved in RNA localization, and mutations in TDP-43 are
associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Yet the RNAs that depend on TDP-43 for localization,
how TDP-43 recognizes these RNAs and promotes their transport, and the phenotypic consequences of their
mislocalization are all currently unknown. This means that an entire regulatory modality contributing to ALS
pathology may be undiscovered.
 Here, we propose to use our combined expertises in subcellular transcriptomics, stem cell
differentiation, and live cell microscopy to engage these critical problems and provide novel insights into ALS
disease mechanisms that likely will result in novel treatment modalities. To do so we have developed a novel
technique to monitor neuronal RNA mislocalization transcriptome-wide, allowing us to identify transcripts that
need functional TDP-43 for proper transport. By combining this approach with our expertise in stem cell
differentiation, we will use this technique to probe TDP-43-mediated RNA localization in functional human
motor neurons. We will identify mislocalized RNAs in engineered TDP-43-null motor neurons, motor neurons
expressing ALS-associated TDP-43 mutants, and motor neurons derived from ALS patients. We will use this
information to derive the RNA sequence requirements that define transcripts that depend on TDP-43 for
transport and test their necessity and sufficiency with reporter transcripts.
 We have also developed a technique for imaging the transport of single RNA and protein molecules
in live Drosophila brains. We will use this approach to visualize TDP-43-mediated RNA transport in live brains
and learn about its dynamics and regulation. Drosophila TDP-43 mutants display phenotypes similar to those
seen in ALS patients. However, as of now data attributing cellular or organismal phenotypes to the
mislocalization of specific transcripts for ALS or any other neurological disease is missing. This may be due in
part to the fact that RNA localization is often overlooked and the transcripts that are mislocalized in disease
states are not known. To engage this problem, we will mislocalize specific transcripts in Drosophila brains that
depend on TDP-43 for transport by removing sequences that TDP-43 recognizes within the transcript. We will
then ask if these flies display the locomotor and physiological defects that characterize both TDP-43 mutant
flies and ALS patients.
 Overall, we intend to define new connections between misregulated molecular mechanisms and ALS
patient phenotypes, thus opening up new avenues of research and therapeutic development."

Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) has been among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide.
However, the pathogenetic mechanisms in ALD are not well understood and, as such, there is an absence of
proven therapies. Emerging evidence now suggests that bile acid abnormalities play a causative role in the
pathogenesis of ALD. Peroxisomes are dynamic organelles controlling cellular metabolic processes, including
bile acid synthesis. Although early studies have implicated peroxisomal damage upon alcohol exposure, the
significance of peroxisomes in ALD is still being underestimated, leaving knowledge about the molecular
mechanisms of peroxisomal perturbation and its metabolic consequence, such as bile acid disorder, upon
alcohol intoxication remain rudimentary. Thus, the objective of this application is to overcome this knowledge
gap by determining the link between peroxisomal dysfunction, the consequent bile acid disorder, and the
development of ALD. Our preliminary studies suggest that alcohol exposure decreases hepatic peroxisomal
biogenesis in a manner dependent on a key peroxin, PEX3, in both alcohol-fed mice and patients with alcoholic
hepatitis. Using a unique mouse model of hepatocyte-specific peroxisome deficiency (PEX3 knockout), we found
that peroxisomes are critical for bile acid synthesis and that PEX3 reduction causes systemic accumulation of
toxic bile acid intermediates and increased susceptibility to alcohol. By pursuing the molecular mechanism
through which peroxisomal dysfunction causes liver damage, we found that peroxisome affects mitochondrial
and ER dynamics, at least partially, through bile acid intermediates. Moreover, we found a strong induction of
lipocalin 2 in ALD patients and mice as well as in PEX3 knockout mice. Further knockout of LCN2 in PEX3
knockout mice ameliorates PEX3 deficiency-induced liver injury. These data led us to hypothesize that alcohol
exposure induces peroxisomal dysfunction and the accumulation of toxic bile acid intermediates via targeting
PEX3, which in turn, promotes the development of ALD. We propose three Specific Aims to test the hypotheses.
Studies in Aim 1 will determine the role of hepatocyte PEX3 reduction in the pathogenesis of ALD using PEX3
knockout and alcohol intoxication mouse models; Aim 2 will characterize the toxicity of bile acid intermediates in
the development of ALD at the gut-liver axis; Aim 3 will explore the role of hepatocyte LCN2 in peroxisomal
dysfunction-induced liver damage in ALD. Knowledge obtained from the study will refine the importance of
functional peroxisomes in maintaining bile acid homeostasis to combat against toxic stimuli, such as alcohol.
The project is expected to have an important impact by defining new molecular targets for the prevention and/or
treatment of ALD and its complications."
10818579,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
The proposed studies seek to isolate and characterize melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) as well as identify the
signals and pathways that govern McSC-mediated melanocyte regeneration. McSC gene expression will be
characterized using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). In zebrafish we will perform longitudinal
sampling of McSCs during regeneration to uncover pathways, both cell intrinsic and extrinsic, involved in
determining McSC fates. scRNAseq of samples from vitiligo patients will also be performed to identify human
McSCs and assess signaling active in these cells. Preliminary studies have identified novel candidate
pathways in McSC biology, including NGFR signaling. This pathway is intriguing because NGFR is a marker of
melanoma initiating cells and was recently found as a defining feature of dedifferentiated melanoma cells that
are resistant to both immune checkpoint inhibitor and BRAF inhibitor therapies. Our data lead to the hypothesis
that NGFR signaling supports the McSCs cell state and this activity is co-opted by melanoma cells in tumor
maintenance and drug resistance. Functional studies in zebrafish will be used to interrogate NGFR and other
candidate pathways. Pathways suspected to be important in McSC fate execution, KIT and macrophage-
mediated, will be also probed using similar methodologies. Combinatorial pathway manipulations will be
performed to assess how these different pathways depend on each other to regulate regeneration. scRNAseq
will inform the targeted pathway studies, serve as a resource to identify new McSC-regulatory signals, and
provide insight into the conservation of McSC signaling across species. This combination of experiments will
provide a detailed understanding of melanocyte stem cells and the controls that guide them during the
regeneration process.
The specific aims of this proposal are:
Aim 1: Define transcriptional changes and cellular trajectories of McSCs and other cells during
regeneration
Hypothesis: Regeneration is characterized by broad transcriptional changes that reflect cell state changes and
engagement of regulators in response to tissue injury.
Subaim 1A: Map the transcriptional and cellular changes that occur during melanocyte regeneration in
zebrafish
Subaim 1B: Define human McSCs and their descendants using scRNAseq of vitiligo and normal skin
Aim 2: Determine and functionally analyze signaling pathways involved in McSC maintenance and
melanocyte regeneration
Hypothesis: A network of cellular signaling systems coordinately regulates McSC maintenance, activation and
fate execution.
Subaim 2A: Identify signaling pathways whose activities change in McSCs and their descendants
during regeneration
Subaim 2B: Functionally analyze pathways involved in McSC maintenance and activation
Subaim 2C: Investigate the roles of macrophages and other intermediary cell types in regeneration"
10809672,"Reversible phosphorylation is a critical regulatory mechanism for spine morphogenesis, synaptic
transmission, long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) contributes to
almost half of the serine/threonine phosphorylation in the mammalian cells, however, the role of three different
PP1 isoforms (PP1α, β, γ) in these processes is ill defined.
 PP1β is not believed to play a role in CNS function. On the other hand, whether PP1α and PP1γ play a role
in synaptic functions have never been determined directly. By using conditional knockout mouse models, we
found that PP1β inhibits synaptic transmission and spine maturation while promotes LTP induction and memory
formation. On the other hand, we found that PP1γ increases synaptic transmission, with PP1α compensating
PP1γ.
 The overarching hypothesis of this application is that myosin phosphatase targeting 1 (MYPT1) and neurabin
(Nrb) mediate the distinct effects of PP1β and PP1γ/α on synaptic function, respectively. In detail, we will test
our hypothesis in Aim 1 that PP1β-MYPT1 holoenzyme inhibits non-muscle myosin IIB-mediated F-actin
contraction in inhibiting spine maturation and synaptic transmission. We will determine in Aim 2 that PP1γ, in
combination with PP1α, promotes spine maturation, synaptic transmission by interaction with Nrb, a major
synaptic scaffolding protein. We will also test our prediction that PP1γ/α achieves these via dephosphorylating
Nrb at Ser200. In Aim 3 we will test our prediction that PP1β inhibits LTD induction, promotes LTP induction and
memory formation while PP1γ/α plays an opposite role.
 We will determine the structure-synaptic function relationship in the roles of PP1β in synaptic transmission
and plasticity, with an emphasis on PP1β C-termini in which one of the human PP1β de novo mutations resides.
 These studies will provide signaling mechanisms of, and structure determinants on, PP1 isoforms in
regulating their distinct roles on synaptic functions."
10839959,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Pancreatic cancer accounts for approximately 3% of all cancers in the United States
and approximately 7% of all cancer related deaths. New treatment paradigms are direly needed. Emerging
tumor ablation techniques have shown significant promise. This proposal will focus on High-Frequency
Irreversible Electroporation (H-FIRE), which delivers a series of electric pulses through electrodes inserted
directly into the tumor to produce structural defects in the target cell membrane resulting in cancer cell death.
The objective of this proposal is to utilize our mouse and novel pig preclinical animal models to expand upon
the preliminary data presented in this proposal and generate critical mechanistic, safety, and efficacy data
necessary to support future H-FIRE clinical trials in pancreatic cancer patients. Our overarching hypothesis
is that H-FIRE will effectively mitigate heterogeneity in physiologically and clinically relevant pancreatic
tumors, with treatments leading to contiguous zones of ablation near critical tissue structures. We further
postulate that the benefits of H-FIRE will ultimately extend beyond focal tumor ablation and generate a
predictable, tunable systemic anti-tumor immune response reducing metastatic burden and preventing
recurrence. Specific Aim 1 will characterize the biophysical response of pancreatic cancer cells and
tissues to H-FIRE. This Aim will evaluate the hypothesis that H-FIRE pulse parameters can be tuned to
achieve different cell death outcomes (apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, or necrosis) that are highly relevant
to tumor ablation, the tumor microenvironment, and anti-tumor immune responses. In concert, we will assess
ablation development with real time treatment feedback using Fourier Analysis Spectroscopy (FAST). We
expect to determine which parameters (i.e. pulse width, energized time, interphase/interpulse delay) play
significant roles in tuning cell death elicited within relevant cancer cell lines and ex vivo tissues. Specific Aim
2 will establish H-FIRE treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer that optimize tumor ablation and
systemic anti-tumor immune responses. Using Pan02 mouse models, this Aim will test the hypothesis that
H-FIRE is an effective treatment modality for precise and complete pancreatic tumor ablation in vivo. We also
postulate that due to the unique features of H-FIRE mediated cell death and resultant changes in the tumor
microenvironment, focal tumor ablation will result in predictable and tunable systemic anti-tumor host immune
responses reducing metastatic burden and preventing recurrence. Specific Aim 3 will define H-FIRE
treatment parameters and determine its safety profile utilizing physiologically and clinically relevant
porcine models of pancreatic cancer. This Aim will test the hypothesis that H-FIRE can effectively ablate
orthotopic pancreatic tumors under physiologically and clinically relevant in situ conditions. To test this
hypothesis, we will utilize novel, orthotopic, porcine pancreatic cancer models featuring a diverse range of
clinically relevant physical properties that are predicted to impact H-FIRE efficacy in human patients."
10813782,"Abstract- The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) mediates working memory and top-down control, but is
impaired by acute or chronic stress, and is dysfunctional in most mental disorders. Stress exposure increases
norepinephrine (NE) release, which strengthens amygdala emotional responses via (β-AR and α1-AR, but
weakens the dlPFC via α1-AR, while the role(s) of β-AR are unknown. Based on this work, the general α1-AR
antagonist, prazosin, and β-AR antagonist, propranolol, are used to treat Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD). However, prazosin and propranolol are not always effective, and findings suggest that some subtypes
of α1-AR and β-AR may benefit PFC, and thus antagonists that block all subtypes may be counterproductive.
The proposed research will perform the first study of α1-AR (α1A-AR, α1B-AR, α1D-AR) and β-AR (β1-AR, β2-
AR, β3-AR) subtype actions in rhesus monkey dlPFC, using multiple label immunofluorescence to localize α1-
AR and β-AR subtypes on pyramidal cells, GABAergic interneurons, astrocytes and microglia, and immunoEM
to reveal ultrastructural locations, e.g. at pre-synaptic release sites or on dendritic spines in layer III dlPFC. We
will use iontophoresis coupled with single unit recordings of dlPFC neurons in monkeys performing a working
memory task to determine how stimulation of α1-AR and β-AR subtypes alters task-related neuronal firing, and
their second messenger actions. We will also use systemic administration of α1-AR and β-AR subtype
selective antagonists to block stress-induced working memory deficits, and test whether selective agent(s) are
more potent and efficacious than the currently used, nonselective agents, prazosin or propranolol, and whether
low doses of more selective antagonists can restore cognition with fewer side effects. Aim 1 will characterize
the roles of α1-AR subtypes, examining their localization (Aim 1A), physiological actions in dlPFC (Aim 1B),
and effects on working memory performance during a mild, acute stressor (Aim 1C). Preliminary data indicate
that the α1A-AR subtype markedly reduces working memory-related dlPFC neuronal firing, and that a selective
α1A-AR antagonist potently blocks stress-induced cognitive deficits, suggesting a superior strategy for
therapeutics. Aim 2 will characterize β-AR subtypes, examining their localization (Aim 2A), physiological
actions in dlPFC (Aim 2B), and effects on working memory performance during a mild, acute stressor (Aim
2C). Preliminary data indicate that the β1-AR subtype markedly reduces working memory-related dlPFC
neuronal firing, and that a selective β1-AR antagonist blocks stress-induced cognitive deficits. In heart muscle,
the “fight or flight” stress response is mediated by β1-AR opening of voltage-gated Cav1.2 Ca2+ channels
(encoded by CACNA1C), and our preliminary data indicate that detrimental β1-AR actions in primate dlPFC
involve similar actions, helping to explain why gain-of-function mutations in CACNA1C increase risk of mental
disorders with impaired dlPFC function, including PTSD. Identifying the subtypes of α1-AR and β-AR that
impair dlPFC function will help the design of more effective therapies for stress-related mental disorders."
10932876,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Tau protein is an attractive AD therapeutic target because the amount and anatomical distribution of insoluble
tau at autopsy is strongly correlated with the symptoms and severity of disease during life. Multiple tau therapies
are now in clinical trials for AD, with many new agents entering the clinic. New approaches to accelerating their
clinical development are urgently needed. A variety of AD biomarkers now exist, including CSF and plasma beta
amyloid ratios and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) levels, and amyloid and tau PET tracers, providing tools to
measure pharmacodynamic effects of amyloid and tau therapies on the core biology of AD. The goal of the
Alzheimer’s Tau Platform (ATP) trial is to conduct a randomized, placebo controlled, Phase 2 platform trial in
preclinical-prodromal AD that will simultaneously test at least two different tau-directed therapies, alone or in
combination with an anti-amyloid therapy, to determine safety, tolerability, and biological based proof of concept
based on the tau PET tracer 18F MK6240 and other tau biomarkers. Platform trials create efficiencies through
generation of a common clinical trial protocol and shared placebo groups to allow a greater number of therapies
to be tested in less time with less expense than by conducting multiple independent trials. This trial will test 5
therapeutic hypotheses involving combinations of 3 drugs versus placebo: Two tau therapies will be studied in a
2 x 3 factorial design (placebo vs. anti-amyloid [n=2] x two tau therapies or placebo [n=3]) for 24 months, in six
parallel arms. The key inclusion criteria for ATP will be >20 centiloids of amyloid PET uptake, 18F MK6240
temporal ROI SUVr >1.25, with a global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) of 0 or 0.5 and MMSE >23. Using these
criteria, we estimate that 150 participants per arm will be necessary to have 80% power to detect a 30% slowing
in the accumulation 18F MK6240 signal over 24 months of blinded therapy. Key secondary endpoints will be
changes in plasma P-tau species (-217, etc.) and neurofilament light chain (NfL), clinical rating scales and
volumetric MRI. Leveraging the experience and resources of the NIH AD Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC), we
propose to enroll 900 participants at ~100 ACTC sites over 24 months, randomize them 5:1 drug:placebo for 24
months of blinded treatment, followed by a 24 month open label extension. We aim to: 1) test the ability of two
tau-directed therapies, either alone or in combination with an anti-amyloid therapy, to slow the accumulation of
tau PET signal over 24 months as compared to placebo or anti-amyloid therapy alone; 2) test the safety and
tolerability of 24 months of blinded therapy followed by an optional 24 month open label extension of combination
tau/anti-amyloid therapy; and 3) explore the ability of each of two tau directed therapies to slow disease
progression as measured by CSF and plasma biomarkers (plasma P-tau, NfL), volumetric MRI and clinical
assessments (Preclinical Alzheimer’s Composite [PACC], etc.). If successful, the ATP will provide data for
decision-making about which tau therapies or combinations to pursue in larger efficacy studies, an ongoing
resource to test new therapeutic approaches beyond tau, and will improve understanding of AD biology."

Anemia is a common condition that causes significant morbidity and mortality and has a negative impact on quality of life. Although anemia can be caused by intrinsic defects in erythroid progenitor cells, the most common forms of anemia are extrinsic defects that affect erythropoiesis. After iron deficiency anemia, the anemia of inflammation is the second most common form of anemia. Inflammation caused by tissue damage or infection alters bone marrow hematopoiesis, skewing production towards myeloid cells at the expense of steady state erythropoiesis. This loss of erythroid output is compensated by stress erythropoiesis. Stress erythropoiesis is highly conserved between mouse and human. Unlike steady state erythropoiesis, which relies on constant production, stress erythropoiesis generates a bolus of new erythrocytes that maintain homeostasis until the source of the inflammation can be resolved. Like other stem cell-based tissue regeneration systems, stress erythropoiesis generates a transient amplifying population of immature stress erythroid progenitors (TA-SEPs), which then transition to a population of committed erythroid progenitors that differentiate into erythrocytes. The expansion of the TA population of SEPs represents a key stage in stress erythropoiesis. If too few TA-SEPs are generated, the subsequent production of erythrocytes will not be sufficient to maintain homeostasis. This proposal will address an outstanding question in this process. What mechanisms drove the proliferation of TA-SEPs during this critical period. Our previous work showed that TA-SEPs adopt a proliferative metabolism characterized by glycolysis and the shuttling of glycolytic metabolites into the anabolic pathways. The establishment of this metabolism requires nitric oxide, NO, dependent signaling. Inhibition of NO production blocks proliferation of TA-SEPs and slows recovery in a murine model of inflammatory anemia. In addition to NO, our data show that Wnt/b-catenin and Yap1 signaling are required for the proliferation TA-SEPs. In this proposal, we will address in two aims the mechanisms that regulate this proliferative metabolism. In Aim 1, we will address the role of NO dependent signaling in regulating the activity of key glycolytic enzymes, pyruvate kinase M2 and phosphofructo-2-kinase/Fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase 4 in TA-SEPs. In Aim 2, we will address the role of NO, Wnt and Yap1 in regulating glutamine metabolism."
10802389,"ABSTRACT
Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects 30 million people in the U.S. African-Americans and Hispanics are 1.4 and 1.2
times more likely to have DM compared to non-Hispanic whites. Diabetes distress—stress, fear, and guilt
related to managing diabetes—is linked to poor glycemic control and disproportionately affects African
Americans and Hispanic adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The American Diabetes Association
(ADA) has published guidelines promoting screening for and addressing diabetes distress (DD) as a critical
part of clinical care. However, only 24% of adults with diabetes report their health care team asked them how
diabetes affected their lives. Efforts to systematically identify and address DD could be an important strategy to
improve diabetes outcomes among disadvantaged populations and address diabetes disparities. Community
health centers (CHCs) can be important partners in this effort; CHCs provide primary care for 2.5 million adults
with diabetes. More than 70% of CHC patients have income below 100% of the federal poverty level and 57%
are people of color. No studies have systematically implemented DD screening and treatment interventions
into a real-world primary care setting or used a guideline based approach. To fill this gap, we developed the
ARISE (Achieving Routine Intervention and Screening for Emotional health) intervention. Based on published
guidelines, ARISE incorporates validated screening instruments, draws from interventions shown to improve
DD and is individualized to patients’ domains of DD. ARISE includes a standardized process for screening
adult patients with T2DM for DD, training for health center staff on how to address distress in the patient
encounter, and an algorithm for action steps and referrals based on the domains identified as sources of
distress. This study aims to compare ARISE to enhanced usual care (didactic training for health care teams on
DD) in CHCs using a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation design via a cluster randomized pragmatic
trial. First, we will adapt ARISE into clinical workflows in two CHCs (one urban and one rural) using the Form
and Function domains of the Complex Health Intervention Framework. Using the lessons learned from the
adaptation, we will conduct a cluster randomized pragmatic trial across 12 CHCs (six ARISE and six enhanced
usual care) to test ARISE vs. enhanced usual care among adult patients with T2DM and A1c>8%. Primary
outcome will be change in A1C from baseline to 12-months between arms. Secondary outcomes will include
change in DD from baseline to 6-months within the ARISE arm and change in patients’ systolic blood pressure,
low density lipoprotein (LDL), and body mass index (BMI) across the two arms. We will assess the adoption,
implementation, and maintenance of the ARISE intervention. We will use knowledge gained to develop best
practices for CHCs across the country that are charged with caring for the largest share of America’s medically
vulnerable patients with T2DM."
10745343,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease and leading cause of dementia, exacts a tremendous toll on both the healthcare system and society broadly. Although the pathogenesis of AD is poorly understood, it centers on the production of so-called β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, which are produced from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the intramembrane protease γ-secretase. Indeed, mutations in the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase alter Aβ production profile and cause familial AD, making the protease a promising target for developing therapies to treat or prevent Alzheimer’s Disease. Specifically, developing agents that can modify γ- secretase activity to selectively reduce the formation of pathogenic β-amyloid species without affecting γ- secretase’s overall activity represent an attractive strategy to target AD. Despite significant progress in studying γ-secretase, we still do not understand how its catalytic activity and specificity are modulated at a mechanistic level. In the proposed project, we will apply a new approach and leverage novel reagents to investigate γ- secretase and its modulation. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we aim to elucidate how the cellular context and external factors modulate γ-secretase at the molecular level. We will also characterize new tools and reagents for γ-secretase and define their mechanism of actions. Collectively, the proposed studies will provide much needed insights into γ-secretase modulation and offer a molecular basis for Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis and therapeutic development."
10660930,"The present study aims to increase Veteran access to supervised exercise therapy and expand its role in
improving functional status, quality of life, and cardiovascular risk profile of Veterans with PAD. To accomplish
these goals, we will use the VA Telehealth service to deploy a remotely accessible supervised exercise training
program and evaluate whether a telehealth-based intervention can improve walking performance, quality of life,
and ultimately cardiac risk in Veterans with PAD. The impetus for the current proposal stems from the following:
1) over 50% of VA-enrolled Veterans live in rural communities; 2) Veterans with PAD are older (mean age, 70
years), further increasing their risk for functional decline; and 3) there is a significant lack of access to facility-
based supervised exercise training for Veterans with PAD.
 The training goals of the present proposal are the following: 1) To obtain practical research study
management experience as primary investigator; 2) To develop skills required for scalable intervention
development and implementation; and 3) To improve stakeholder engagement skills. By completing the
following aims, the applicant will undergo invaluable training in regard to the development, implementation,
and dissemination of a newly proposed Veteran model of care for local and national adoption. The central
hypothesis of this proposed research is that a telehealth-based intervention can improve physical function,
health-related quality of life, and reduce coronary artery disease risk among Veterans with PAD. Two
prospective pilot studies will accomplish our initial steps and include the following:
 Aim 1. To develop a telehealth-facilitated exercise intervention for Veterans with PAD that
serves as a Veteran centric new model of care. We will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and
implementation of a telehealth-facilitated supervised exercise program. Using a prospective pre-post pilot study
design, Veterans with PAD (n=54) will be enrolled in a 12-week, 3 day a week, aerobic training program in a self-
selected location. Nine exercise cohorts of 6 patients are planned. Data on participation, satisfaction, technical
errors, and adherence will be collected. Walking performance, quality of life, and PAD risk factor metrics at
baseline and completion of intervention (3 months) will also be evaluated.
 Aim 2. To integrate Veteran preferences into the development of a telehealth-facilitated
supervised exercise program. We will collect and evaluate patient, provider, and stakeholder feedback with
each exercise cohort. These data will be used to actively modify the intervention to improve feasibility,
acceptability, and potential scalability for future broad based implementation.
 Aim 3. To assess the long term patterns of functional impairment and quality of life among
Veterans with PAD not undergoing supervised exercise training. We will conduct a prospective
longitudinal study contemporaneous to the pilot study described above. Using a prospective cohort study design,
we will measure the natural course of overall physical performance and its impact on PAD risk factors and quality
of life of Veterans with PAD (n=100) in the absence of supervised exercise therapy. This cohort will not include
Veterans participating in Aims 1 and 2. Data on walking performance, functional status, perception of walking
ability, quality of life, PAD risk factors, and cardiovascular risk will be collected at baseline and 12 months.
 The pilot data collected through this proposal will guide the development of a novel Veteran centric model
of care. Telehealth is highlighted as a research priority by the VA Office of Research and Development/Health
Services Research and Development Service to improve access to care for underserved populations.
Furthermore, this work serves as a foundation for a [subsequent Merit Award application during year 3 of the
proposal focusing on a multi-site implementation trial and outcomes assessing reach, adoption, fidelity, and
sustainability.]"

 The Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food, and Forestry proposes to continue our
state Produce Safety Program to encourage the safe production of fresh fruits and vegetables
and to promote compliance with the requirements of FDA’s Regulation “Standards for the
Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption.”
 In order to accomplish this goal, we plan to: assess our produce farm landscape,
establish a process to develop and maintain a produce farm inventory, develop and support the
program’s infrastructure, formulate a multi-year plan, identify and collaborate with industry
and educational partners, provide education and technical assistance to farming operations,
perform outreach to inform the industry of the produce safety rule, build a complete farm
inventory, inspect covered non-exempt farms for compliance with the produce safety rule,
track and report aggregate data on program activities and inspections, and assess our ability to
respond to a produce-related event/incident.
 The accomplishment of this goal will advance efforts for a nationally integrated food
safety system by having the state produce safety program align with the FDA produce safety
program. The funds that are made available through this cooperative agreement will allow our
agency to implement multi-year, strategic plans to ensure continuous improvement and
demonstrate we are moving towards the goals of improved produce safety and high rates of
compliance with the Produce Safety Rule. Without the funds being made available through this
funding opportunity our agency would be unable to undertake any part of attaining this goal.
 We are applying for grant Path C, as our state has authority to inspect and enforce
compliance on produce farms for any federal program as listed in the Oklahoma State Board of
Agriculture Powers of the Board in Oklahoma Statutes §2-2-4 #34

Women with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) face stigmatization and healthcare inequity
surrounding reproductive rights and pregnancy. Institutionalization and forced sterilization were, and still often
are, too common. A lack of opportunity for women with IDD has limited our knowledge of pregnancy in a group
already facing economic, health, and educational inequities. It is crucial to identify perinatal interventions for
pregnant women with IDD because they face increased risk of maternal morbidity and poor birth outcomes.
Access to Medicaid pre-pregnancy reduces maternal morbidity but enrollment policies differ by state.
Understanding when pregnant women with IDD enroll for Medicaid may be a pivotal tool in increasing
opportunity for prenatal care. In the general population, timely and high-quality prenatal care can reduce the
risk of maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and rehospitalization. We do not know how prenatal care impacts
outcomes for women with IDD. Medicaid Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) waivers allow for
additional services (e.g., transportation) that help people with IDD thrive in their communities, but how waivers
impact access to prenatal care are not known. Our goal is to use national data, in conjunction with qualitative
interviews of women with IDD, to identify optimal practices and policies that reduce maternal morbidity in
Medicaid enrolled women with IDD. We propose to use data of Medicaid covered pregnancies to women with
IDD (N>72,000) from 2011-2022 to identify impacts of pre-pregnancy Medicaid enrollment, prenatal care
adequacy, and HCBS waiver receipt on gestational diabetes, preterm birth, and re-hospitalization in women
with IDD. In parallel, women with IDD are experts in their experience and we will conduct qualitative interviews
with women with IDD who are or were pregnant to capture the lived experience of women with IDD throughout
the reproductive course, with specific emphasis on prenatal care and health insurance enrollment. Our aims
are to Describe pre-pregnancy Medicaid enrollment in women with IDD and examine if pre-pregnancy
enrollment is associated with reduction in preterm birth, gestational diabetes, and post-partum hospitalization;
2) Describe timing and adequacy of prenatal care in women with IDD and examine if adequacy of prenatal care
is associated with reduction in preterm birth, gestational diabetes, and postpartum hospitalization; 3) Describe
patterns in HCBS waiver receipt and type of services used in pregnant women with IDD and examine if HCBS
receipt and type are associated with prenatal care adequacy and post-partum hospitalization; 4) Investigate
health care and legal barriers, opportunities to improve pregnancy care and outcomes and inform quantitative
analyses by conducting semi-structured interviews with women with IDD. Our approach uses quantitative and
qualitative data to identify key factors in individual care and state level policy that will ultimately be developed
into interventions and state and national policies. As more women with IDD start families, our work is
fundamental in ensuring that pregnant women with IDD thrive."
10825591,"Summary
Learning and memory storage is a complex process that has proven challenging to tackle. Despite significant
progress in understanding classical conditioning, it is likely that in nature, the instructive value of reinforcing
experiences is acquired rather than innate. In other words, many of our learning experiences occur by inferring
value from a previously associative structure of the environment and not by the mere contiguity of conditioned
and unconditioned. This is relevant because the association between seemingly neutral stimuli expands the
gamut of possibilities to create meaningful associations and generalizations and increases the predictive power
of moment-by-moment experiences. High-order conditioning falls within this category of learning. This proposal
aims to understand the biological basis of olfactory sensory preconditioning, a form of high-order
conditioning. Specifically, we will use behavioral and functional imaging techniques combined with neuronal
and genetic manipulations, including optogenetics, to define the basic rules and dynamics of sensory
preconditioning. We will also test the dopamine modulation’s role in this form of learning. Finally, we will test the
hypothesis that olfactory representations are altered during sensory preconditioning and that this altered
representation is fundamental for forming associations between valueless stimuli. The long-term goal of this
proposal is to gain knowledge on the biological basis of how our brain achieves sensory
preconditioning.
This proposal is highly significant because there is a big gap in our knowledge of biological basis of high-order
conditioning. In addition, understanding how memories are encoded and disrupted in brain disorders is a
prerequisite to the rational design of treatments for memory impairment. Our understanding of memory formation
is based heavily on classical conditioning research. Nevertheless, we argue that high-order conditioning is
more relevant than Pavlovian association in real naturalistic situations. The results of the present studies
will provide guideposts for future research into the neurobiology of memory formation during high-order
conditioning. The project will support our long-term goal of understanding memory down to the single-cell and
subcellular levels, contributing to the knowledge base necessary for the rational development of novel treatments
for memory impairment."

The primary goal of this Program Project is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which the physiological
and pathophysiological functions of integrins are regulated in blood and vascular cells. The “Protein Expression
and Purification” Core B will assist each of the three projects realize this common goal by providing the proteins
and cDNAs needed to analyze these molecular mechanisms. The proteins needed by the projects of the program
are integrins, talin, kindlins, IRAK1, paxillin, and fragments of these proteins. The cDNAs needed are for
expression of the integrins, talin, paxillin, kindlins, and IRAK1, mutant forms of and fragments of these proteins.
By providing well-characterized proteins and cDNAs, this core creates reliable reagents that are useful to all
three Projects of the Program. To address the structure-function relationships proposed in each project of the
program requires substantial amounts of the wild-type and mutant forms of the target proteins. Both bacterial
and mammalian expression of proteins is needed. The centralization of protein expression and mutagenesis
avoids unneeded replication of procedures within individual laboratories, provides access to equipment that is
needed for protein expression and purification, and allows these tasks to be performed efficiently and
economically by experienced personnel. There is also a training element to Core B. The Core personnel will train
fellows and technical staff within the individual projects to perform protein purification, bacterial and mammalian
expression, mutagenesis strategies and in protein characterization approaches."

that house world renowned biomedical and human genomics research laboratories. Pairing
MSU Denver with UCD is ideal as the two institutions are co-located at the Auraria campus in
downtown Denver and are less than 10 miles from the University of Colorado Denver
Anschutz Medical Campus. The PATH-GREU Program will: (1) Recruit undergraduate
students from diverse demographic groups underrepresented in genomic research; (2)
Establish a rigorous genomics research training program and supportive learning community
that strengthens scientific understanding and promotes professional skills acquisition; and (3)
Create a life-long community and mentorship network that enables scholars to embrace their
identity as scientists and advance their careers in genomics. In doing so, PATH-GREU will
build and support a diverse genomics scholar community within Metro Denver and
Colorado."
10833211,"Osteoporosis (OP) is a global health concern with enormous socioeconomic burdens. Alarmingly, rates of
osteoporosis screening using standard dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are abysmal, which contributes
to high rates of preventable fragility fractures. Our long-term objective is to develop an accessible screening
method based on Raman spectroscopy (RS) for early, accurate identification of at-risk patients during visits to
primary care providers or community clinics. We posit that this would increase referrals for a gold standard
DXA diagnosis and earlier interventions to reduce the incidence of preventable fragility fractures. We
previously demonstrated the reliability and sensitivity of RS to detect biochemical changes associated with
bone diseases in various mouse models and reported robust correlations of Raman spectral features with
whole bone strength and fracture toughness. We also developed instrumentation and sophisticated algorithms
to subtract optical contributions from overlying soft tissue to enable reliable diagnostically sensitive
transcutaneous RS (tRS) of murine bone on intact limbs. As we pivot to scale up our instrumentation to make
diagnostic measurements in humans, we are addressing three significant challenges. First, the ability to make
reliable transcutaneous bone measurements is hampered by the signal from the thick layers of soft tissues that
overlay the bone. Therefore, we identified the phalanges and metacarpals in the hand as anatomical sites
suitable for tRS measurements, which can be accomplished by adjusting illumination source-detector offsets
and establishing spectral libraries of various tissues. Second, there are no currently demonstrable associations
between RS of peripheral bones of the hand and BMD at the clinically relevant sites of fragility fractures such
as the wrist, hip, and spine. Third, there is currently no evidence that RS of bone can be safely and reliably
acquired in living subjects for bone health diagnosis. In Aim 1, we will adapt our group’s novel spectral
unmixing algorithm, SOLD, to apply it to a recently acquired dataset of human cadaver hand tRS
measurements. The adaptation will account for spatial heterogeneities in Raman spectral responses at the
midshaft versus the epiphyseal regions. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate diagnostic associations between tRS
measurements in the phalanges and metacarpals of cadaver hands with clinically relevant wrist and hip DXA
T-scores and wrist fracture risk. The cadaver hands will be obtained from donors with different sexes, ages,
races, BMI, and DXA BMD and T-scores. In Aim 3, we will launch a pilot in vivo tRS study on 50 volunteers to
improve methodology, identify differences from cadaver data, and perform fracture risk estimations directly
from the tRS data. The proposed studies represent essential steps to demonstrating proof-of-concept of
transcutaneous Raman spectroscopy as a clinically relevant diagnostic and prescreening tool for osteoporosis.
Successful completion of the project will lay the foundation for future clinical studies."

The natural disease course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is punctuated by events, termed
exacerbations, when symptoms are acutely worse. Exacerbations are costly and burdensome – they are
associated with accelerated lung function decline, impaired health status, increased hospitalization, and
increased mortality. Evidence suggests that some individuals are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, but
heterogeneity remains poorly understood. There is thus an urgent need to better delineate COPD
heterogeneity and improve identification of groups at risk for these adverse outcomes as early as possible. Our
long-term goal is to use quantitative imaging and trajectory-based subtype analysis to delineate COPD
subpopulations, enabling early identification of subpopulations at risk for adverse, long-term outcomes. We
have developed CT biomarkers of pulmonary vascular pruning, cardiac morphology, emphysema subtypes,
airway thickening, and skeletal muscle wasting in CT imaging. However, we have not performed an integrative
analysis of these biomarkers that could better delineate homogeneous subgroups. We have also developed a
Bayesian trajectory algorithm that incorporates longitudinal data to identify distinct population subgroups with
similar biomarker patterns while accounting for factors such as age and smoke exposure. Our overall objective
in this proposal is to use multidimensional trajectory analysis to evaluate novel CT biomarkers in terms of
exacerbation risk-stratification. Our central hypothesis is that multidimensional trajectory analysis of pulmonary
and extra-pulmonary CT biomarkers can identify subgroups with latent susceptibility to exacerbations. The
rationale for this work is that by identifying distinct trajectory subgroups using multiple CT biomarkers, we will
better delineate COPD heterogeneity, leading to earlier, more precise risk-stratification – especially amongst
those patients for whom CT imaging is the most reliably available data source, such as those who have
undergone lung cancer CT screening. Aim 1 focuses on the methodical assessment of our novel CT
biomarkers in terms of COPD exacerbation risk stratification using trajectory analysis. Aim 2 focuses on using
CT biomarkers and trajectory analysis to identify subgroups within a lung cancer screening cohort that are at
risk for hospitalizations due to COPD exacerbations. The approach is innovative, in our opinion, because it
shifts focus from disease staging to identifying mechanistically similar subgroups (endotypes). The significance
of these contributions will be an improved understanding of CT-assessed patterns of abnormality in cardio-
pulmonary and extra-pulmonary systems and how these patterns present in trajectory subgroups at risk for
adverse events. In turn, we expect this to better enable detection of early disease manifestations and subtype
characterization. We expect these contributions to enable further studies of the mechanistic differences
between subgroups as well approaches to preempt costly acute events by identifying the early-stage
manifestations of at-risk groups."

Single-cell sequencing (scSeq) allows us to achieve new discoveries by distinguishing cell types, states, and
lineages from heterogeneous tissue microenvironments. However, it remains challenging to interpret complex
single-cell data from highly heterogeneous populations of cells. Currently, most existing single-cell data analyses
focus on cell type clusters defined by unsupervised clustering methods that cannot directly link cell clusters with
specific biological and clinical phenotypes. Additionally, the ever-increasing capability of scSeq in profiling
thousands to millions of cells brings more challenges of pinpointing which cell cluster for further analysis. Given
so many cells, the rationale of our ""phenotype-centric"" analysis is based on a Buddhist theory that ""Each
individual can only drink one bottle of water from the entire river."" Therefore, focusing on specific cell
subpopulations related to essential phenotypes is more important than evenly analyzing all cell clusters.
Furthermore, clinical phenotype information, such as treatment resistance, survival outcomes, cancer metastasis,
and disease stages, is primarily collected on bulk tissue samples. As a result, there is an unmet need to leverage
widely available clinical phenotype information to aid subpopulation identification from single-cell data.
Meanwhile, single-cell samples generated under different conditions require tools to identify the phenotype-
enriched subpopulations for each condition. Taken together, there is a great need for further methodological
progress for ""phenotype-centric"" scSeq data analysis. To this end, we propose to develop a suite of supervised-
learning-based novel methods to accurately identify the most highly phenotype-associated cell subpopulations
from scSeq data. We will (1) develop a platform with broad utilities for bulk phenotype-guided subpopulation
identification from scSeq; (2) build a novel strategy to learn high-confidence phenotype-enriched subpopulations
from scSeq data; (3) and establish a new platform for supervised phenotypic trajectory learning of subpopulations
from scSeq data. The proposed methods will be evaluated by rigorous simulations and real data analyses. This
proposal is conceptually innovative in the following aspects: (1) Our bulk phenotype-guided scSeq analysis
enables hypothesis-free identification of clinically and biologically relevant cell subpopulations from scSeq data;
(2) Our supervised learning frameworks can simultaneously select genes and identify phenotype-associated
subpopulations from scSeq data; (3) Our method to learn cell subpopulations associated with continuous
phenotypes has a unique feature to recover the hidden phenotypic stages. In summary, we expect this proposal
to deliver a suite of novel machine learning methods for ""phenotype-centric"" single-cell data analysis, thus
allowing us to precisely pinpoint disease-relevant subpopulations from single-cell data for cellular target
discovery."
10821473,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal will determine if exercise chronotherapy improves nocturnal blood pressure (BP) in older adults
with hypertension. Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which is the
leading cause of death in the U.S. Hypertension is estimated to affect 75% of older adults. While typically
managed using a combination of medications and lifestyle modifications, it is estimated that only 21% of adults
with hypertension have controlled BP. Therefore, optimizing treatment options for adults with hypertension is of
paramount importance. Nocturnal BP is an emerging target in the management of BP, given its association
with cardiovascular outcomes. Chronotherapy combined with hypertension medications is effective at lowering
nocturnal BP and future cardiovascular risk, with medications taken in the evening being more effective than
medications taken in the morning. Preliminary evidence suggests chronotherapy combined with exercise (i.e.,
planned physical activity) may impact the acute and chronic responses to exercise. This research will
characterize diurnal rhythms of vascular health outcomes across age and disease and guide timing of exercise
intervention and outcome assessment, which will lead to improved BP management and vascular function.
Three specific aims will accomplish this goal. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the effect of age and
hypertension on macrovascular and microvascular diurnal rhythms. Endothelial function, microvascular
function and arterial stiffness will be evaluated along with 48-hr ambulatory BP monitoring and physical activity
tracking in young and older males and females with and without hypertension. Aim 2 will study the acute BP
and vascular responses to exercise performed at different times of the day, focusing on nocturnal BP, post-
exercise hypotension, and morning vascular function. Older males and females with hypertension will complete
a session of aerobic and isometric handgrip exercise in the morning and late afternoon/evening. BP will be
evaluated immediately following exercise and for 24-hr using ambulatory BP monitoring. Endothelial and
microvascular function will also be evaluated the morning after each exercise bout. Aim 3 will determine the
long-term impacts of exercise chronotherapy by evaluating exercise training time of day effects on nocturnal
BP and vascular function in postmenopausal women with hypertension. Participants will complete two 6-week
periods of aerobic and isometric handgrip exercise training with one period in the morning and one in the late
afternoon/evening. Ambulatory BP and vascular function will be assessed pre- and post-training and compared
between time of day. The overarching hypothesis is that hypertension is characterized by the reduction of
diurnal rhythms in vascular function and that evening exercise in this population will be more effective than
morning exercise at lowering BP and improving vascular health both after a single exercise bout and 6 weeks
of exercise training. This proposal has the capacity to optimize treatment options for hypertension by including
chronotherapy in the exercise recommendations, which in turn will improve the health of older adults."

Antibiotic resistance (AR) is a high-priority urgent threat. AR pathogens such as the ESKAPE group cause
millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of deaths. While current strategies such as genetic and drug
screens have helped identify genes and mutations critical for AR in specific pathogens, there is a broad lack of
methods to help understand AR’s origin and continuous adaptation. AR can arise in a pathogen via a variety of
molecular changes, including acquiring protein domains, individual genes, or metabolic capabilities. Hence,
predicting and overcoming AR in emerging pathogens or discovering new AR mechanisms requires a holistic
understanding of AR evolution across multiple molecular scales. However, leveraging these diverse datasets is
challenging because original databases are siloed from each other. Further, the different data types are hard to
integrate in a biologically-meaningful way across scales. In this project, we describe a computational discovery
framework combining evolutionary analyses and machine learning to integrate AR data across multiple scales
to gain mechanistic insights into AR molecular features in ESKAPE pathogens and predict AR in new
(re)emerging genomes. We will implement our approach as open FAIR data repositories, open software, and
web platforms for the computational, experimental, and clinical AR communities. We will work closely with AR
collaborators, end-users, and the open software community during and following the project duration to ensure
the release of accessible, user-friendly, interactive platforms. Finally, in the post-award expansion phase, we
will work with NIAID-funded bioinformatics consortia for downstream integration of data and methods and
long-term sustainability. The framework will develop in this project will be broadly applicable to advance
understanding of AR in understudied and emerging pathogens (beyond ESKAPE) towards ending the arms
race between microbes and drugs by creating better treatment outcomes."
10758957,"ABSTRACT
Subunit vaccines are safer and can more broadly be applied across the population then other vaccine
formulations such as live-attenuated. However, subunit antigens are often poorly antigenic and require
formulation with an immune stimulating adjuvant to garner protection. Additionally, some vaccines require more
than one adjuvant, necessitating combined adjuvants to stimulate a protective response. Also, a combined
adjuvant could decrease vaccination boosts and provide longer protection. One avenue to evaluate combined
adjuvants is with mast cell (MC) agonists. MCs are throughout the body and reside at many interfaces of the
host and the environment. When activated MCs recruit monocytes and leukocytes to the local area and help to
promote an adaptive response. MC agonists combined with toll-like receptor (TLR), nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD-2), or stimulators of interferon genes (STING) agonists should
elicit not only a humoral response, but also a cellular response to create an efficacious and effective vaccine.
Herein we will evaluate combined MC agonists with TLR, NOD-2 or STING agonist to identify synergistic pairs.
Pairs will be evaluated in mice and human cells as well as with cells from collaborative cross (CC) strains. The
CC strains are a large panel of recombinant inbred mouse strains with genetic variation that can mimic the
human population as well as give insight into genetic variables that contribute to adjuvant mechanism. To ensure
that the adjuvants are co-delivered as well as offer dose sparring, storage outside the cold chain and controlled
release of adjuvant, we will formulate them into acetalated dextran (Ac-DEX) microparticles. Ac-DEX
formulations have illustrated enhanced delivery of STING, NOD-2, TLR and MC agonists in vitro and in vivo,
above that of other carriers like liposomes or PLGA particles. The best identified adjuvant combination will be
evaluated in a mouse model of a vaccinia vaccine with subunit antigen BR8. We will use pattern recognition
receptor (PRR) knock-out mice as well as cell deficient mice to elucidate aspects of the combination adjuvant's
mechanism. Additionally, we will employ genetic sequencing tools to mechanistically identify the combination
adjuvants mechanism."

The NIH INCLUDE initiative focuses on critical health and quality-of-life needs for individuals with Down
syndrome (DS). Part of this mission is “to conduct targeted, high-risk, high-reward basic science studies on
chromosome 21.” In addition, the NIA is prioritizing research that aims “to understand the molecular
mechanism(s) underlying the interplay between aging and neurodegeneration in DS”. This proposal addresses
these goals by DS-AD links in sleep disturbances in DS individuals. Connections between Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and DS are well-documented, but the mechanisms underlying them are little understood. A strong
candidate is the cleavage product of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Aβ, a defining histopathological marker
of AD which promotes sleep dysfunction. Another candidate trisomy21 gene, Regulator of Calcineurin1
(RCAN1), affects circadian function and promotes AD-related pathology. This proposal focuses on APP and
RCAN1 overexpression as mechanistic links between DS and AD-related disease involved in sleep disruption,
circadian dysregulation, cognition impairment, and synaptic deficits. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
genetic manipulation to restore Rcan1 to normal levels rescues sleep disturbances in a DS model. Therefore,
our central hypothesis is that RCAN1 triplication in DS promotes sleep disturbances and exacerbates AD-
related pathology. However, because APP and Aβ42 disrupt sleep and induce cognitive deficits, we will also
assess the role of APP overexpression in DS sleep disturbances. Specifically, we will: 1) determine the effects
of App and Rcan1 gene dosage correction on age-dependent sleep disruption and circadian clock expression
in DS model mice; 2) quantify the effects of Rcan1 gene dosage correction on age-dependent synaptic deficits
and network firing properties in DS model neurons; and 3) leverage the power of transcriptome analyses to
infer molecular mechanisms underlying sleep disruption in Dp16 mice. Outcome measures for the proposal
include sleep and circadian behavioral assessments; hippocampal slice electrophysiology; multi-electrode
array (MEA) recordings in DS-derived neuronal culture; unbiased transcriptome analyses; cytokine protein
assays; and immunohistochemical evaluation of glial activation and pathological tau. Our approach is
conceptually and technically innovative because the role of APP and/or RCAN1 have not been formally
considered in DS-AD-linked sleep abnormalities. Also, MEA methods not been used to study sleep in a DS
model. This study is significant because, despite the links we have articulated, the role of APP or RCAN1
overexpression in promoting DS-related sleep or cognitive abnormalities has not been investigated. Data from
the successful completion of this project will begin to fill a critical knowledge gap by determining how
APP/RCAN1expression influences sleep disturbances and progression of AD-like pathology in DS. Importantly,
data implicating APP/RCAN1-induced neuroinflammatory processes would suggest potential therapeutic
avenues that could improve sleep quality or slow disease progression in DS individuals."

Autoimmune disease results from a combination of immunologic missteps involving multiple genes, cell types
and environmental factors. In the proposed studies, we will study how these factors promote the transition from
sub-clinical autoimmunity to autoimmune disease by comparing individuals at risk for type 1 diabetes, a disease
with a well-defined natural history of sub-clinical autoimmunity, and individuals with Down syndrome (DS), a
condition with extremely high risk of developing autoimmune disease. The central hypothesis is that the naïve T
cell compartment of at-risk individuals is enriched for potentially pathogenic precursors “poised” to transition to
autoreactive effector T cells, and the failure of regulatory mechanisms to restrain this process ultimately results
in autoimmune disease. The approach leverages access to cross sectional and longitudinal cohorts at high risk
or known to progress to autoimmunity; expertise in the genetics and autoantigen-specific T cells in the context
of autoimmunity and expertise in single cell multi-modal analyses. Together, this expertise will allow us to probe
T cell states in a manner not yet applied to autoimmunity. In our first two Aims, we will deeply characterize T
cells across platforms from at risk subjects and address the role of epigenetics. In Aims 3 and 4 we address the
role of external triggers using longitudinal cohorts prospectively tracking trigger events and determine whether
autoimmune features are exaggerated in subjects acquiring a second autoimmune disease Aim 1 will determine
whether pathogenic precursors are present in the naïve T cell compartment of individuals at risk for autoimmune
disease compared to non-risk individuals. Aim 2 will identify cell types that harbor the genetic risk for disease
transitions and identify underlying pathways that support pathogenic precursor T cells. Aim 3 will identify external
factors that contribute to the transition of pathogenic precursors to effectors, including a prospective longitudinal
high-risk cohort with intense at home sample collection to track immune variation bridging trigger events. Aim 4
will determine whether features seen in individuals who transition to T1D are exaggerated in individuals who
develop additional autoimmune diseases. Ultimately, the knowledge gained from this work will contribute to
staging of disease, selective therapies and establish biomarkers to determine risk of progression and response
to therapy."
10807073,"Project Title: C-terminal Peptide of Cardiac Troponin I for the Treatment of Diastolic Heart Failure
Project Summary
Myocardial contractility is essential for cardiac function. Troponin-mediated thin myofilament regulation
controls cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. The troponin complex consists of three protein subunits: the
calcium receptor troponin C (TnC), the inhibitory subunit troponin I (TnI), and the tropomyosin-binding subunit
troponin T (TnT). Cardiac TnI plays a pivotal role in myofilament activation and deactivation, determining the
kinetics of cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation, and pumping efficiency of the heart. Our research project
focuses on a novel therapeutic peptide derived from the conserved C-terminal end mobile domain of cardiac TnI
(cTnI-C27) for its effect on enhancing myocardial relaxation and the underlying mechanisms. Biochemical,
genetic and physiological approaches and mouse models of diastolic cardiac dysfunction are employed to study
cTnI-C27 peptide to understand its selective enhancement of diastolic function of the heart. The ultimate goal is
to develop a targeted treatment for diastolic heart failure (HFpEF) that presently lacks an effective treatment.
 Three Specific Aims are proposed in the research plan: Aim 1 is to characterize the mechanism for
exogenous cTnI-C27 peptide to modulate myofilament function as an activated state-specific myofilament Ca2+-
desensitizer. We shall determine the binding site of cTnI-C27 peptide on tropomyosin in thin filament and
characterize its effect on contractile kinetics and endogenous troponin regulation of myofibril actomyosin
ATPase in reconstituted myofilaments and skinned cardiac muscle. The results will determine how exogenous
cTnI-C27 peptide modulates cardiac muscle contractility, especially the enhanceing of Frank-Starling response
without increasing sarcomere length. Aim 2 is to study the delivery of cTnI-C27 peptide into cardiomyocytes for
functional effect. Heart-homing fusion peptide, AAV9 and inducible transgenic expression of cTnI-C27 peptide
will be studied in vivo and in ex vivo working hearts. Effects on cardiac muscle contractility and heart function
will be examined for therapeutic efficacy in normal and diastolic dysfunctional and fibrotic mouse hearts to
evaluate the therapeutic potential of cTnI-C27 peptide. Aim 3 is to determine the chronic effects of exogenous
cTnI-C27 peptide on cardiac function and remodeling. To develop the cTnI-C27 peptide for the treatment of
chronic heart failure, we need to understand the effects of chronic presence of cTnI-C27 peptide on cardiac
muscle. We shall examine the therapeutic and side-effects of chronic transgenic expression of cTnI-C27 peptide
in normal and failing mouse heart. In vivo and ex vivo cardiac function, tolerance to hemodynamic stresses, and
myocardial remodeling will be examined in young and aging mice to collect informative longitudinal data.
With combined expertise in myofilament protein structure-function relationships and cardiac physiology and
pathophysiology using multi-level experimental approaches, the study of a promising therapeutic peptide of
endogenous origin will lay mechanistic and methodologic groundwork for translating a novel myofilament
mechanism into a new treatment for diastolic heart failure."
10843292,"ABSTRACT
 All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is the main physiologically active derivative of vitamin A, which serves as a ligand
for nuclear transcription factors, RA receptors. During development, RA is produced in a quickly changing
spatiotemporal pattern to control the expression of precise sets of genes at different developmental stages.
Critical RA-sensitive processes during development are RA-concentration dependent, which underscores the
importance of the precise control over RA synthesis in a strictly defined and rapidly regulated manner.
 Biosynthesis of RA includes reversible rate-limiting oxidation of retinol to all-trans-retinaldehyde, followed by
irreversible oxidation of all-trans-retinaldehyde to RA. Multiple studies examined the roles of the enzymes
catalyzing the oxidation of retinaldehyde and degradation of RA in establishing the dynamic pattern of RA
concentration. However, the mechanism regulating the upstream rate-limiting step, which supplies the immediate
RA precursor, retinaldehyde, in a precise spatiotemporal pattern remains unknown. It has been established that
two proteins, retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 3 (DHRS3), are
critical for the control of retinaldehyde levels during development. We have recently discovered that DHRS3
binds to RDH10 and upon binding reduces the output of retinaldehyde by RDH10 by recycling retinaldehyde
back to retinol. As a result, the formation of the bifunctional retinoid oxidoreductase complex (ROC) that consists
of an oxidative RDH10 and reductive DHRS3 attenuates the RA biosynthesis. Whether this mechanism works
in vivo and whether ROC exists in animal tissues is unknown, but if proven to be true, this finding will have a
paradigm-shifting effect on our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate embryogenesis through vitamin
A. The major hypothesis driving this proposal is that ROC represents a previously unrecognized universally
conserved mechanism that can both provide the RA synthesis with robustness (Aim 1) and enable the dynamic
changes in RA spatiotemporal pattern by regulating the levels of RA precursor (Aim 2). The hypothesis will be
tested using a zebrafish embryogenesis model to take advantage of external fertilization and transparency of
zebrafish for intra-vital visualization of RA synthesis and formation of the complex.
 Successful completion of these studies will advance the field at the conceptual level by demonstrating a
mechanistically novel model of producing strictly controlled spatiotemporal gradients of small molecules. These
findings will lay the foundation for a better understanding of the mechanisms of congenital diseases associated
with dysregulation of RA homeostasis."

Alphaviruses are mosquito-transmitted, positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses of the Togaviridae family that
cause global disease in humans. At present, no antiviral agents or licensed vaccines exist for the treatment or
prevention of any alphavirus infections. We recently used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based screen to identify
the cell surface molecule LDLRAD3 as a novel, highly conserved entry receptor for Venezuelan equine
encephalitis virus (VEEV), an emerging pathogen capable of causing fatal neuroinvasive disease in humans and
other vertebrate animals. Gene editing of mouse or human LDLRAD3 resulted in reduced VEEV infection of
neuronal cells, and reciprocally, ectopic expression of LDLRAD3 resulted in increased infection. LDLRAD3
bound directly to VEEV virions and enhanced virus attachment and internalization into cells. Genetic studies
indicated that domain 1 (D1) of LDLRAD3 is necessary and sufficient to support VEEV infection. We hypothesize
that engagement of LDLRAD3 by VEEV will explain how infection, tissue targeting, and disease pathogenesis
occurs. The primary goals of this collaborative, interactive project between the Diamond, Fremont, and Whelan
laboratories are to define the precise mechanism(s) by which LDLRAD3 facilitates alphavirus entry into cells, to
gain high-resolution structural insight as to how LDLRAD3 engages the spike proteins on the virion, and to
determine the cell-type specific role of LDLRAD3 in VEEV pathogenesis in vivo. The experiments in this proposal
will define fundamental aspects of VEEV biology that enhance our understanding of infection and cell tropism.
This information may facilitate the development of small molecules or biologicals that disrupt LDLRAD3
interaction with VEEV spike proteins, which could form the basis of future therapeutics that ameliorate disease
of this emerging and highly pathogenic alphavirus."

Liver cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. More than 700,000 people are diagnosed with this
cancer each year throughout the world. Liver cancer is responsible for more than 30,000 new cases and 12,000
deaths a year in the United States. Liver cancer has been found to be highly associated with ER stress/unfolded
protein response (UPR)-induced chronic inflammation; however, the mechanisms remain unclear.
Using a genetic approach, we have found that deletion of an ER protein, CNPY2, from macrophages prevents
carcinogen-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, accompanied by reduced ER stress/UPR signals and tumor-
associated macrophages in tumors. Furthermore, CNPY2 is required for pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL6 and
TNFα released from Kupffer cells/liver macrophages. We also observed that CNPY2 plays a central role in
regulating both ER stress/UPR and TLR4 signaling, two pathways known to promote cytokine production and
differentiation of macrophages. Together these observations suggested that CNPY2 promotes liver oncogenesis
through regulation of macrophages.
In this proposal, I will aim to address several fundamental questions in the field of HCC: 1) what is the
mechanism by which CNPY2 transcriptionally regulates production of IL6 and IL23 in macrophages. Are both
the UPR and TLR4 pathways involved in this regulation? 2) what is the biochemical and structural basis for the
roles of CNPY2 in promoting TLR4 signaling-dependent cytokine production in macrophages. Solving crystal structure
of CNPY2 will help drug development against CNPY2. 3) The potential mechanism by which CNPY2 regulates
differentiation, infiltration and function of tumor-associated macrophages in HCC. 4) What is the role of
CNPY2 in tumor immunity? Does targeting CNPY2 improve anti-tumor immunity in HCC? Our traditional
and conditional Cnpy2 KO mice are unique models for addressing these questions. Successful execution of this
work will significantly advance the field. In the longer term, this study may lay a strong foundation for the
development of a new class of therapeutics for cancer, based on the rational design of CNPY2 inhibitors against
tumor-associated macrophages."
10914862,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genetic studies have improved our understanding of disease etiology and treatment. However, there are at
least two shortcomings preventing current studies from reaching their potential in elucidating the genetic
architecture of complex traits for all humans. First, current genetic studies largely ignore the genetic
relationships among individuals in a study. Many of these relationships may be distant, but nonetheless can be
connected on genealogical trees at every position of the genome through a coalescent process. The collection
of such (unobserved) trees is encoded by the ancestral recombination graph (ARG). Second, genetic studies
are generally biased towards relatively homogeneous, continental, populations such as European or East
Asian populations, in part due to a lack of methods tailored towards admixed populations. In this proposal we
aim to develop new methods to address both shortcomings. Our framework leverages recent breakthroughs
that allow, for the first time, accurate and scalable estimation of ARGs. In Aim 1 we will leverage a new
estimator of relatedness based on the ARG that can retain more information of relatedness from incomplete
genetic data (e.g. array genotype data) compared to the current standard estimator for relatedness. We will
use this estimator to estimate trait heritability and cross-population genetic correlation of complex traits and
diseases in humans, as well as to correct for confounding due to population structure in genome-wide
association studies. In Aim 2, we will develop an association-testing framework that uses the ARG to identify
trait-associated genomic regions and prioritize trait-associated haplotypes. This principled approach can
naturally account for allelic heterogeneity and has the potential to improve the power of association studies
through lowered multiple testing burden, which is particularly important for understudied populations where
recruitment of participants is more challenging. Finally, in Aim 3 we will develop a population genetic
framework that uses ARGs to model the admixture history of a population. Using this model, we will develop
new ways to detect genes that have responded to recent selection and identify complex traits that have
evolved under different kinds of phenotypic selection. Importantly, our framework will address these
evolutionary questions in each ancestral component of the admixed population. Throughout each Aim we will
benchmark our methods with extensive simulations. We will also evaluate our methods empirically using large-
scale real-world human genetic data. Finally, we will apply our methods to genotyping and sequencing data
from admixed populations to discover new loci associated with human diseases and/or experienced natural
selection in the past. In summary, we will mine the wealth of information from the ARG and address
fundamental population- and human-genetic questions, particularly in understudied and admixed populations."

 Benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) are widely used antimicrobials in disinfecting products, medical products,
consumer products, and food processing industries, suggesting humans may be exposed chronically and sys-
temically to BACs through a variety of routes. Our preliminary study found that close to 50 of 100 random hu-
man plasma samples contain detectable levels of BACs, suggesting BACs are indeed absorbed. The ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic has led to greatly increased use of BAC-containing disinfectants, which is concerning
given accumulating evidence in respiratory, developmental, reproductive, and neurological toxicities inflicted by
BACs and BAC-induced disruption of cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in rodents. However, there is a lack of
knowledge on the metabolism, transport, and biological consequences of BACs in humans. Our goal is to
characterize the pathways of metabolism and transport of BACs and their impact on nephrotoxicity of BACs.
The potential for nephrotoxicity is supported by previous studies in rats showing that BACs accumulate to the
highest level in the kidney after oral intake and our preliminary studies showing that BACs exert potent cytotox-
icity in a 3D “kidney-on-a-chip” microphysiological system (MPS). Recently, we reported that BACs are metab-
olized by human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms CYP2D6 and CYP4s in vitro. Furthermore, we found that
BACs are actively transported by human organic cation transporters (hOCTs). Because CYP2D6, CYP4s, and
hOCTs are highly polymorphic with greatly varying protein activities, we hypothesize that toxicities of BACs in
kidney are dependent on the activities of BAC-metabolizing and transporting proteins in both liver and kidney.
In Aim 1, we will characterize pathways of metabolism and transport of BACs in vitro, including secondary me-
tabolism by β-oxidation and glucuronidation and transport by hOCTs, human multidrug and toxin extrusion pro-
teins, and P-glycoprotein. In Aim 2, we will evaluate nephrotoxicity induced by BACs in human proximal tubule
epithelial cells in 3D integrated liver-kidney “organs-on-chips” MPS. An integrated sterolomics, lipidomics, and
transcriptomics approach will be used to systemically assess the toxicity and biological activities of BACs. In
Aim 3, we will assess BAC exposure levels and their correlation with lipid and kidney injury biomarkers in hu-
mans, as well as the impact of genetic variations on BAC metabolism and disposition. The significance of this
project lies in that it will, for the first time, address the knowledge gap in metabolism, transport, and toxicity of
BACs in humans. Elucidation of the contribution of reduced activities in CYPs and/or transporters to BAC tox-
icity would enable us to identify high-risk human population with genetic variations in these proteins. The
gained knowledge could also inform federal agencies on setting more appropriate exposure limitations. The
innovation of this project lies in a) a novel example of gene-environment interaction through xenobiotic-
processing proteins, b) the use of an integrated liver-kidney MPS to assess the toxicological consequences of
xenobiotics, and c) integrated omics for rigorous systems toxicology studies."

West Nile Virus (WNV) can cause severe and long-lasting neurological disease. Initial infection in the
hippocampus results in some of the neuropathology and neuroinflammation seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
There are three human apolipoprotein E (E) isoforms, which play a role in cholesterol metabolism: E2, E3, and
E4. Compared to E3, E2 is protective with regard to AD risk, while E4 is an AD risk factor. E4 is also associated
with enhanced entry of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) cell entry and HIV-1 disease progression. E
an

is
HIV-1-inducible inhibitor of viral production and infectivity in macrophages, involved i n the pathogenesis and
to other infectious diseases, including herpes simplex virus-1, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis E virus,
zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, malaria, (LM), andListeria monocytogenes Klebsiella pneumoniae. In
a mouse model of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), the cerebral load of latent HSV-1 genomic copies, which is
associated with the reactivation risk, is 10-fold higher in E4 than E3 mice. These apoE isoform differences might
involve very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), as E4 binds better than E3 to VLDL and impairs their lipolytic
processing. WNV capsid protein binds VLDL, as does Dengue virus capsid protein and is thought to be important
for uptake and transport of virus. The differential interactions of apoE isoforms with human amyloid precursor
protein (APP) and with the amyloid peptides A40 and A42 generated from APP might influence cognitive injury
and neurodegeneration. APP, A40 and A42 might be important in viral infections as well and AD patients might
have an altered susceptibility to viral infections. We crossed APP NL-G-F mice with human apoE targeted
replacement (TR) mice and will use these mice for the proposed study. The hippocampus shows neuropathology
in brains of WNV patients and C57BL/6J wild-type mice infected with an attenuated WNV strain show spatial
learning impairments associated with interleukin 34 (IL-34)-dependent engulfment of presynaptic terminals by
activated microglia in the hippocampus during and after viral infection. We will determine whether prior exposure
to WNV worsens hAPP/A-induced behavioral alterations and cognitive impairments and neuropathology in 6-
and 12-month-old hAPP KI mice in an apoE isoform-dependent fashion, and whether these effects are
associated with enhanced neuroinflammation and microglial activation. We include novel wireless temperature
sensors to analyze body temperature and circadian rhythms following WNV exposure and as a function of
hAPP/A apoE isoform, and age. We will also assess cytokines and chemokines in plasma and brain.
Neuroinflammation, neuron loss and upregulation of APP and Aβ are not specific to AD and/or WNV infection.
While there is significant overlap between WNV and neurodegeneration pathogenesis, this has been understudied
and it is important to increase our understanding about the similarities as this will facilitate the identification of
novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. This proposal is
submitted in response to PAR-22-094 and NOT-AG-21-039."

The goal of the work described in this proposal is to collect grow, store and expand airway epithelial cells
and smooth muscle cells. These cells will come from bronchoscopic biopsies (brush biopsies for epithelial
cells and endobronchial biopsies for smooth muscle cells) from Core B. The main site for collecting, growing
and storing the cells will be at IU, but there will be a satellite facility at CWRU to grow cells from
bronchoscopies in Cleveland. Subjects will include both severe asthma patients and healthy control
subjects. Cells will be provided to investigators from both sites to each or the Projects for use in their Aims,
as described. Cells will be catalogued and labeled (by bar code) by study number from Core C. This will
allow analysis of the relationship between clinical phenotype, drug response, genotype (for Project 3) and
airway cell behavior. Cells will be stored long-term at the IU site. Each sample can be thawed and further
expanded for study and testing at the IU site. The ability to collect, expand, and distribute airway epithelial
cells to researchers will have a positive impact on understanding and developing therapies for common
airway diseases. This will be the only core with these capabilities at either site."

 Repair of chromosome breaks by Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) determines the
effectiveness of many cancer therapies, especially ionizing radiation. NHEJ is also essential for
assembly of antigen receptor genes (immunoglobulins and T cell receptors) required for
adaptive immunity. Here we propose to investigate the fundamental mechanism of this
pathway, with a focus on aspects relevant to the effectiveness of radiation therapy.
 We’ve previously shown repair by NHEJ is often initiated by Polymerases that add RNA to
the 3’ end of one strand of a chromosome break, which stimulates ligation of that strand. In
Aim1 we will investigate the next steps, repair of the complementary strand, and replacement of
RNA embedded in the initially repaired strand. Preliminary data argues the RNA embedded in
the first step of NHEJ is not always metabolized well, and thus may contribute to genome
instability.
 RNA incorporation also has a role in determining the choice of DSB repair pathway.
Synthesis initiated from a 11-15 nucleotide RNA primer at the 5’ ends of the DSB has been
shown to re-direct repair to the NHEJ pathway. This mechanism helps determine of the
effectiveness of therapies, including radiation therapy, that specifically target hereditary breast
cancers. However, our preliminary data indicates the RNA primer must be removed for NHEJ to
occur; in Aim 2 we will investigate a candidate mechanism for removal of the primer.
 Targeted inhibition of DNA repair pathways holds great promise as a means of improving the
effectiveness of radiation therapy. In Aim 3 we will systematically explore the consequences of
combined DNA pathway inhibition on genome stability. We will address the impact of separate
and combined inhibition of the two end joining pathways, and how pathway inhibition in both
cases differs from genetic deficiency, as well as the impact of impaired incorporation of RNA by
NHEJ polymerases."
10833169,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Inhibitors of the principle kidney glucose transporter, SGLT2, have been shown to slow the progression of
chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus. However, major knowledge gaps
remain in how these drugs act on the kidney. Knowledge gaps include how SGLT2 inhibitors alter kidney
microvasculature functions, the tubular system, and kidney metabolism. Features that are observed at the
whole-kidney level emerge from events at the microscopic level and treatments have their direct effect at the
microscopic level. Microscopic behavior, however, cannot be deduced from whole-kidney behavior and must be
observed directly. This cannot be done in humans but can be done in rat and mouse models of human kidney
injury using specialized techniques at which the investigators are expert. By these methods this research will
determine the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the inner workings of the kidney. This includes a proposed
relaxation of the efferent arteriole, which may not have any effect on GFR but it always reduces filtration
fraction and increases O2 delivery to the kidney. Studies will determine potential for targeting of SGLT1 as a
new therapeutic strategy to protect the kidney. We will determine whether SGLT2 inhibitors have off-target
effects in the kidney, which have been proposed for the heart. We will compare the metabolomics signature of
these drugs in both experimental and clinical samples. And we aim to delineate the metabolomic and
proteomic signature of these drugs in the very tubular cells they target, i.e., the early proximal tubule, but also
compare these effects with responses in downstream tubular cells exposed to more glucose as a consequence of
drug action. Our goal is an integrated understanding how these drugs impinge on the kidney in the healthy and
diseased kidney to better understand their therapeutic benefits."
10832108,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs) that result in nerve gap (segmental-loss, ablation) defects are the most
common and costly cause of temporary and permanent nervous system dysfunction. The current best clinical
practice to repair ablation PNIs is to suture to host nerves bridging devices such as autografts, acellular nerve
allografts or synthetic conduits. Outcomes are poor because the return of any sensation or behavioral recovery
depends upon slow and imprecise axonal outgrowths, often taking months to years to re-innervate targets. Viable
peripheral nerve allografts (PNAs) are rarely used experimentally or clinically due to the risks of
immunosuppressive therapy and graft rejection.
 To greatly improve current treatments for segmental-loss PNIs, our team will translate our synergistic
technologies of localized immunosuppression and polyethylene -induced axon fusion (PEG-fusion) of viable
PNAs. PEG-fusion of PNAs rapidly (within minutes) restores cytoplasmic/electrical continuity and prevents
Wallerian Degeneration to 40-60% of axons, immediately re-innervates denervated tissues and reliably promotes
a highly accelerated return of voluntary behaviors within weeks. PEG-fused chimeric axonal segments within
PNAs are not rejected by the host even without immune suppression (ISN) and tissue matching. Localized ISN
further reduces the immune response.
 Translation of PEG-fused PNAs with localized ISN technologies would produce a paradigm shift from
current clinical practice of waiting days to months to repair ablation PNIs with autografts, acellular nerve allografts
or conduits, where the patient outcome is solely dependent upon axon regeneration. In contrast, repairing
ablation PNIs by PEG-fusion/localized ISN of donor allografts applied within three days of injury would generate
significantly improved functional outcomes (weeks instead of months/years) produced by PEG- fusion axons and
robust regeneration of non-fused axons through the viable PNA enhanced by localized ISN.

10795922,"Older adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an increased risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that can
result in grave health consequences, such as seizures, falls, and myocardial infarctions. Care partners (e.g.,
spouses, friends) regularly become part of the diabetes care team to assist in self-management as a person
with diabetes ages. A technological advancement that is available to people with diabetes and their care
partners to address harmful hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is to use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM),
with a data-sharing app that allows the older adult with T1D and their care partner (dyad) to see glucose data
on their smartphones and to receive an alert before hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia occurs. Our long-term goal
is to leverage the full potential of technology and care partner interventions to optimize the support that care
partners can provide for effective glucose management in older adults with T1D. Our overall objective is to test
an intervention, called Share plus, aimed at improving the use of data sharing between persons with diabetes
and their care partners in order to maximize the benefits of CGM. The Share plus intervention provides
instruction to current CGM users about how to set up the data sharing app, dyadic communication and problem
solving, and how to establish a data-sharing action plan for older adults with T1D and their care partners.
Our central hypothesis is that Share plus will result in increased time-in-range and decreased diabetes distress
for both persons with diabetes (PWD) and their care partners (CPs) compared to the control group. The
rationale for this pilot study is that demonstrating the efficacy of Share plus will provide new opportunities for a
clinically useful approach to increase time in glucose range and decrease diabetes distress among older adults
with T1D and their care partners. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1)
evaluate feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the Share plus intervention compared to the control group
receiving data sharing with diabetes self-management education, 2) evaluate the effect of Share plus
intervention on time-in-range and Diabetes Distress, and 3) explore the differences between groups in PWD
and CP dyadic appraisal and coping, quality of life, diabetes self-care and care partner burden. To test our
central hypothesis, we will conduct a pilot randomized 1:1 control trial in older adults with T1D already using
CGM (N=80 dyads) in a telehealth format where the intervention group will receive data sharing and Share
plus and the control group will receive diabetes self-management education and assistance setting up the data
sharing app. The trial will include a 12-week active intervention to determine a change in primary outcomes
and a 12-week observation-only phase to determine maintenance of changes. The research proposed in this
application is innovative because it provides a needed and substantive departure from the status quo by
bringing a dyadic perspective of T1D management using data-sharing technology."
11158363,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Clinical stimulation and physiologic fluctuations are a normal part of the early management of patients with
severe strokes. It is possible, however, that episodic stimulation (inducing brain activation) or physiologic
insults (such as hypotension) could in fact cause harm by triggering damaging spreading depolarization (SD)
events in vulnerable brain. This is based on 1) a recent pre-clinical study in a mouse model of stroke, 2) our
own preliminary data suggesting that such events are associated with subsequent SD, and 3) results of a
major pivotal trial that showed worse outcomes in stroke patients who received early mobilization. It is
therefore critically important to rigorously assess the effects of routine clinical interventions on SD in human
subjects. The current study is part of our long-term goals, focused on understanding the mechanisms,
consequences, and therapeutic approaches related to SD in acute neurological injury. With this application, we
seek to determine whether normal interventions in the intensive care unit are associated with an increased risk
of SD in the sensorimotor cortex in patients with large hemispheric strokes. We will assess this using subdural
electrocorticography electrodes paired with tissue oxygen probes in the sensorimotor region adjacent to the
infarct border in patients with large hemispheric stroke who require decompressive hemicraniectomy. We will
then perform long term video EEG recordings to assess for stimulation events and collect continuous
physiological measurements, all time locked with SD recordings. SD will also be scored with standard criteria.
We will these assess whether more stimulation events or more transient physiologic insults are associated with
SD using several statistical approaches. These analyses will provide fundamental insights into whether such
events could trigger SD, which is expected to result in worsening stroke outcomes. Such findings would have
important implications for patients, particularly with severe stroke, where early aggressive mobilization has
been demonstrated to result in worse outcomes and larger strokes. If the mechanism of worse outcomes in
these studies is confirmed to be related to SD triggering, then this would provide the foundation for future
efforts to mitigate these effects or target SD to improve outcomes."
10837684,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major world-wide health problem that accounts for
approximately 40,000 deaths per year in the US. A major cause of death in ALD is the onset of an acute
liver failure event called alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). The mechanisms that cause the onset of AH
in patients with ALD are unknown. The most important treatment for ALD is alcohol abstinence.
Unfortunately, some people with ALD who stop drinking fail to adequately improve in terms of liver
function or fibrosis. Again, the mechanisms leading to incomplete disease resolution after abstinence
are unknown. Liver macrophages, including Kupffer cells and infiltrating macrophages, play a central
role in regulating liver function during ALD but how they contribute to the onset of AH and what role
they play in the outcome of liver disease following alcohol abstinence is unknown. We recently
developed a new western diet alcohol (WDA) model of ALD that reproduces features of human alcohol-
associated steatohepatitis in mice. Using single cell RNA sequencing, we have identified alcohol
specific Kupffer cell subsets and assessed the function of these by selectively ablating them using
diphtheria toxin receptor techniques. During alcohol exposure, KC ablation resulted in liver failure with
hepatocytes de-differentiating into a progenitor-like phenotype very similar to the situation in human
AH. This result demonstrates that KCs play a previously unrecognized role in maintaining differentiated
hepatocyte function during chronic alcohol exposure. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that
during alcohol exposure, KCs produce signals, such as exosomal Let-7, that help to maintain
hepatocytes in their differentiated state. Loss of KCs or KC function can trigger an AH-like loss of liver
function. Upon alcohol cessation, KCs are also required for resumption of liver homeostasis and fibrosis
resolution. Loss of KC subsets can delay recovery and suppress resolution of ALD fibrosis. In the
current proposal we will determine how specific KC and IM subsets regulate hepatocyte function during
alcohol exposure, how they change and function upon cessation of alcohol consumption, and how this
information can be used to improve liver function and enhance recovery from ALD. We will achieve
these goals with the following specific aims. (1) To determine the functions of KC and IM subsets in a
mouse model of ALD, (2) to determine how Kupffer cell loss promotes hepatocyte transition to a
progenitor-like state, and (3) to assess the role of MΦ subsets in fibrosis development and resolution
after alcohol cessation. Understanding the factors that regulate the presence and function of alcohol-
specific KC subsets would provide the opportunity to develop macrophage-based therapies to reverse
liver failure in patients with AH and accelerate recovery in patients with ALD who cease alcohol
consumption."

fostering communication networks among FDA CTP scientists to encourage the uptake of best practices,
accelerate sharing of research findings, promote collaboration, and generate innovative research ideas. To
achieve this goal, we will implement a multifaceted approach to share and disseminate information within the
CTP research community that ensures ease of access and timely sharing of information and study results.
With our robust infrastructure, the Westat team is uniquely well-positioned to support communication within the
TRS research community and promote rapid dissemination of research findings to broad audiences. This Core
will house the centerpiece of our communication infrastructure, the TRS Knowledge Center website which
offers the community a wide range of TRS-specific resources and information. The DC will also continue the
successful CASEL Webinar Series and our bi-monthly Digest. The Core will be led by Dr. Cassandra Stanton,
who has served in this role on CASEL 1.0. Among the activities she will spearhead in the Core are initiatives
such as themed special journal issues that provided a high-impact forum for bringing together research in
priority topics from multiple-disciplinary teams across FDA CTP-funded grantees. Other modes of
dissemination will include concise summaries of recent research, workshops, scientific presentations, and
peer-reviewed journal articles. Through the work of this Core, existing resources will continually expand and
new systems employed to improve communication, tracking, and opportunities for rapid dissemination. As the
Center for Rapid Surveillance of Tobacco (CRST), TCORS, and other FDA CTP-funded grantees produce

10865100,"ABSTRACT: Antisocial behavior is common in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). These behaviors
result in significant morbidity and can lead to crimes in extreme cases. Yet despite being one of the most
challenging and problematic symptoms to manage clinically, the mechanisms leading to antisocial behavior in
FTD are unknown, and treatments remain limited. The goal of the current proposal is to determine the
cognitive and neural mechanisms leading to antisocial behavior in FTD. Understanding these
mechanisms will have a major impact on FTD patients by improving clinical evaluations to monitor the onset
and progression of antisocial behaviors, helping to develop novel pharmacologic and neuromodulatory
treatment strategies, and informing legal and ethical treatment of FTD patients who commit crimes. In Aim 1 I
will examine the neural mechanisms and the hypothesis that FTD patients with antisocial behavior will have
atrophy in a pre-defined network of brain regions I identified in patients with antisocial behaviors caused by
focal brain lesions. I will test this hypothesis using a new neuroimaging method I recently developed and
validated called atrophy network mapping that uses the human connectome and single-subject atrophy maps
to localize neurological symptoms to brain networks rather than an isolated region. In Aim 2 I will examine the
cognitive mechanisms and the hypothesis that FTD patients with antisocial behavior have specific impairments
in moral decision-making. My long-term goal is to use multimodal neuroimaging and decision-making tasks to
better understand the mechanisms leading to antisocial behavior and other behavioral problems in dementia
patients. To achieve this goal, a training plan is proposed to learn additional research skills in functional
neuroimaging methods (Training goal 1) and the neuropsychology of social decision-making (Training Goal 2).
Additional training in leadership, biostatistics, and grant-writing will prepare me to achieve independence

End-stage renal disease (ESRD) and its associated complications are disproportionately higher in
veterans compared to the general U. S. population. Approximately 45,500 veterans currently receive
hemodialysis. In the U.S., there is an estimated 500,000 ESRD patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis
and this number is predicted to rise to over 1 million by 2030. In veterans on dialysis, cardiovascular disease
is the leading cause of death and the risk of death is particularly high on the day of dialysis. The long-term
goal of the candidate is to conduct research that will lead to improved cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis
patients, a highly relevant goal for the health of American veterans. Research: This proposal will evaluate
novel mechanisms by which dialysis-driven risk factors contribute to cardiovascular disease. Dialysis-related
alterations in RBC phosphate metabolites lead to myocardial tissue hypoxia and intra-dialytic hypotension and
understanding the mechanisms of these changes should lead to new therapeutic strategies for ameliorating
cardiovascular mortality in this population. Specific Aim 1 will utilize an in vitro model to investigate dialysis
specific factors affecting 2,3-DPG concentrations.
Specific Aim 2 will examine the relationship between
changes in 2,3-DPG and hypotensive episodes during dialysis sessions. Specific Aim 3 will determine whether
changes in 2,3-DPG during dialysis are associated with myocardial dysfunction, utilizing a novel quantitative
imaging methodology based on real time echocardiography. Candidate: The program is designed to help Dr.
Sharma develop into an independent and productive researcher investigating cardiovascular complications of
chronic kidney disease, focusing on phosphate metabolism and eventually other aspects of chronic kidney
disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD), both topics highly relevant to the VA patient population. Dr.

related alterations in erythrocyte 2,3-DPG associated with myocardial tissue hypoxia/ischemia and intra-dialytic
hypotension 2) develop expertise in interpretation, and advanced processing of multi-
parametric echocardiographic images 3) gain skills in laboratory techniques supporting translational studies as
well as related advanced bio-statistical approaches. Dr. Sharma will accomplish these activities through
studies supervised by her mentors, coursework, and participation in workshops. Mentors: Dr. Sharma has
assembled a team of accomplished scientists with proven track records in the mentorship of academicians
including her primary mentor- Dr. Kim-Lien Nguyen, who serves veterans as a non-invasive
cardiologist/cardiac imaging expert at the Greater Los Angeles VA and leads a productive, well-funded
cardiovascular imaging research laboratory focused on the development, translation, and application of
advanced cardiovascular imaging techniques, including echocardiography (ultrasound) and magnetic
resonance. Dr. Sharma's co-mentors are senior investigators and renowned in their respective fields: Dr.
Tomas Ganz (RBC biology and iron), Dr. Isidro Salusky (mineral metabolism and CKD), and Dr. Joachim Ix
(cardiovascular complications and CKD, Physician Scientist at VA San Diego). They will instruct and assist the

11116828,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the most common sleep disorder, is a major problem in the Veteran
community that poses risks for decreased physical and mental health. The predominant treatment for OSA is
positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. While PAP therapy is highly effective, adherence is suboptimal with
approximately 50% stopping therapy by year 2. Our group has shown that breathing patterning is predictive of
long-term adherence, but the method used requires a 15-minute procedure while awake. The goal of this
project is to refine breathing patterning metrics and enhance clinical integration by repurposing clinical data
obtained as part of routine OSA evaluation (sleep studies) and treatment (PAP machine data).
 This retrospective analysis will first apply an already-developed breathing pattering metric to be more
applicable for both in-lab polysomnography and home sleep apnea testing. Comparison of the breathing
patterning metric in sleep and wake will determine applicability for home sleep apnea testing, which does not
gather sleep staging data. Because PAP machines only record flow, we will also evaluate whether the
breathing patterning metric has similar performance characteristics in different respiratory signals
(plethysmography and flow) for predicting adherence by comparing concordance index. We will then evaluate
for the optimal breathing patterning metric and machine learning algorithm based on accuracy in predicting
PAP adherence. Breathing patterning can be measured in multiple ways; to optimize adherence, a panel of
breathing patterning metrics will be evaluated. Multiple machine learning algorithms will be compared to
determine which has the best discrimination for predicting PAP adherence. Breathing patterning changes with
age will be evaluated. In addition, we will evaluate the added utility of breathing patterning to a model that
predicts adherence using patient demographics, past medical history, and sleep study summary data. This
project could provide a practical, cost-effective method to identify patients that are likely to become
nonadherent.
 My short-term career goal is to develop a foundation of focused research in optimizing obstructive sleep
apnea (OSA) treatment via patient-centered solutions that will inform my clinical practice. To fulfill this goal, the
developed research and career development goals of this CDA-2 project complement each other. Additional
instruction in modern machine learning techniques will allow for adherence model development and validation.
Coursework in clinical informatics will assist me in optimizing the design and data collection from the VA
electronic medical record. Instruction on managing research records will help with managing the large
databases necessary for this project. Proposed training in research team leadership and responsible conduct
of research is particularly relevant to a transdisciplinary project such as this and will have long-term career
benefits. Over the course of this award, I will develop skills that will further my long-term career goal to
transition to an independent investigator with national funding.
 Both research and career development goals will be overseen by my highly-qualified mentors. Dr. Strohl,
an expert in respiratory physiology and OSA, will be my primarily research mentor. Dr. Strohl has successfully
mentored numerous researchers to independence. Dr. Jacono studies breathing pattern variability and will act
as my primary career mentor. Regular meeting with my mentors will allow us to plan, troubleshoot, and assess
progress towards an independent research career. This CDA-2 will provide me with the necessary support for
a solid start towards my long-term research goal of exploring relationships between sleep disorders, therapy,
and co-morbidities through multidisciplinary translational studies."
10824281,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dr. Yogesh Reddy, MBBS, MSc, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at
Mayo Clinic. Dr. Reddy is seeking a Mentored Career Development Award to develop the training required to
study the contribution of skeletal muscle abnormalities to exercise performance in patients with Pulmonary
Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Dr. Reddy has received extensive training in pulmonary vascular hemodynamics
in PAH during his previous training under the T32 grant, providing necessary skills and experience to study the
central cardiovascular abnormalities that drive exercise intolerance in PAH. While therapies targeted to these
central limitations have markedly improved clinical outcomes in PAH, a wide therapeutic gap remains, as nearly
90% of patients report significant residual symptoms even after treatment with pulmonary vasoactive therapy.
Preliminary studies have suggested that peripheral abnormalities in skeletal muscle may contribute to the
exercise intolerance of patients with PAH, but no study has yet used gold standard methods to measure skeletal
muscle oxygen (O2) utilization during exertion in PAH. To fill this knowledge gap and build new skills in the
characterization of peripheral deficits in PAH, Dr. Reddy proposes to: 1) determine the independent role of
skeletal muscle and mitochondrial O2 transport abnormalities in exercise performance in PAH compared to
controls, and 2) perform a randomized clinical trial of isolated quadriceps (knee-extension) based training to
assess its effect on peripheral O2 transport and whole-body exercise performance in PAH. In this proposal, Dr.
Reddy is seeking the primary mentorship of Dr. Barry Borlaug, an experienced, NIH-funded investigator with
expertise in exercise physiology in pulmonary hypertension, who has a proven track record of successfully
mentoring junior investigators. The mentorship team supervised by Dr. Borlaug includes multidisciplinary experts
who will provide necessary advanced training in the fields of mitochondrial biology (Dr. Sreekumaran Nair), leg
blood flow quantification and exercise training interventions (Dr. Thomas Olson), iterative mathematical modeling
and biostatistical methods (Dr. Rickey Carter), patient reported outcomes (Dr. Shannon Dunlay) and clinical trials
in PAH (Dr. Robert Frantz). As a result of the training proposed, Dr. Reddy will obtain the skills necessary to: 1)
comprehensively evaluate mitochondrial and peripheral O2 transfer physiology during exertion, and 2) conduct
randomized trials of an exercise-based intervention. The advanced training obtained during this award in skeletal
muscle biology and exercise physiology will greatly complement the skills he has already obtained characterizing
central hemodynamic abnormalities in PAH, uniquely positioning him to succeed as an independently-funded
clinician scientist focused on the pathophysiology and treatment of exercise intolerance in PAH, understanding
and investigating the problem “from all angles”. The data derived and expertise gained will form the basis for a
competitive R01 application centered on novel treatments targeting peripheral deficits for patients with PAH."
10889036,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Neurodegeneration, characterized by myelin and axonal injury, is a key driver in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathology and
a major determinant of patients’ disability and outcome. Currently, it is not possible to assess neurodegeneration in vivo
because there are no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers sensitive and specific to myelin and axonal injury.
Finding this biometric is set as a major priority by an MS International Panel of Experts, as a path toward halting
neurodegeneration and promoting neuroprotection in MS. Accordingly, the long-term goal of the current lines of
investigations is to identify MRI biomarkers of neurodegeneration and repair that can be used to monitor disease and predict
likelihood of progression. The overall objective of this work is to establish the sensitivity to disease, neurological
dysfunction and outcome, of two novel MRI methods in patients at the time of diagnosis.
 The central hypothesis of this proposal is that metrics derived from selective inversion recovery quantitative
magnetization transfer imaging (SIR-qMT) and multi-compartment microscopic diffusion imaging using the spherical mean
technique (SMT) are sensitive hallmarks of myelin and axonal neurodegenerative tissue injury early in the disease course,
and relate to and predict disease progression more accurately than currently favored MRI measures. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Establish that metrics derived from SIR-qMT (Aim 1) and SMT (Aim 2)
are sensitive hallmarks of neurodegenerative injury and reflect neurological dysfunction cross-sectionally, early in the
disease course; 2) and explore if metrics derived from SIR-qMT and SMT predict clinical outcome and radiological
progression, longitudinally, more accurately than currently favored MRI measures (Aim 3). Longitudinal data will also be
used for sample size computations for proof of concept clinical trials on neuroprotection and repair (corollary analysis).
 The research proposed in this application is innovative because, through the use of two advanced and novel MRI
techniques, this project 1) assesses and measures progression of neurodegeneration in Veterans with MS; and 2) delivers
sample computations for proof of concept clinical trials on neuroprotection. The proposed research is significant because
1) it will lay the foundation for future larger studies providing a more accurate understanding of MS progression in Veterans;
2) it will help untangle the effects of modifiable and non-modifiable Veteran-related risk factors on disease progression and
mortality; and 3) it has the potential to support new interventions and treatments."
10866515,"Project Summary: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease that remains largely
incurable. Although the cause for this profound therapeutic resistance is poorly understood, it is however partly
blamed on signaling factors present in the tumor microenvironment (TME), which supports the proliferation and
survival of neoplastic cells. Apart from being stroma rich, PDAC TME is associated with a distinctive tumor
immune infiltrate. Paradoxically, most immunotherapy trials using immune checkpoint inhibitors, either as
monotherapy or combination, failed to increase patient survival motivating exploration of new therapeutic
strategies. To that end, the cytokine mediated heterotypic interactions between cancer cells and immune cells
remain largely unexplored. In a recent study, we demonstrated that cytokines, IL4 and IL13, secreted by TH2
cells (a subtype of CD4+ T cells), provide trophic support for PDAC development. Mechanistically, inhibiting this
cytokine mediated crosstalk between cancer-TH2 cells either genetically or pharmacologically drastically reduces
tumor growth and increases survival in a preclinical model. Our subsequent preliminary work identified a potent
inflammatory cytokine, IL33 which is overexpressed and released by PDAC cells that attract and activate TH2
and other immune cells such as innate lymphoid cells 2 (ILC2) and Tregs. Importantly, we found that the release
of IL33 by PDAC cells is mediated by intratumor mycobiome. Inhibition of IL33 or anti-fungal treatment leads to
a decrease in the infiltration and activation of type 2 immune cells (TH2 and ILC2) and Treg cells, accompanied
by significant PDAC tumor regression. Taking these observations together, we hypothesize that type 2 immune
response plays an important role in PDAC tumorigenesis and intratumor mycobiome is key to the IL33 secretion.
The major objective of this proposal is to elucidate the role of mycobiome in the IL33 mediated type 2 immune
response and provide pre-clinical evidence to guide future clinical studies with an anti-IL33 monoclonal antibody
in PDAC patients. To that end, we will determine the molecular mechanism of mycobiome mediated IL33 release
in cell and organoid models of PDAC. Further, to conduct a clinically relevant study, we will analyze IL33,
intratumor mycobiome and type 2 immunocytes in the PDAC patient tumor and serum samples. While our
preliminary studies using the syngeneic orthotopic model have shown a significant tumor regression upon IL33
deletion or anti-fungal treatment, synergistic combination strategies are expected to be even superior in efficacy.
So, we propose to use an anti-IL33 antibody in combination with anti-fungal treatment for superior efficacy.
Finally, to block the IL33-TH2/ILC2 axis we have three genetically engineered mouse models that will allow
rigorous testing of the function of IL33 in PDAC tumorigenesis. In conclusion, our study is poised to identify a
novel strategy to target PDAC patients and provide mechanistic insights for future clinical development of anti-
IL33 therapy."

Screening for lung cancer has the potential for a profound public health benefit. Lung cancer is the leading
cause of US cancer morbidity and mortality for both men and women, responsible for more deaths than breast,
cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers combined. Annual screening with low-dose computed tomography
(LDCT) reduced lung cancer mortality by 20%. Successful population-based screening requires continuous
monitoring to adherence repeat screening in high risk adults to achieve similar results. Repeat annual
screening is necessary for early detection of lung cancer. Baseline or first LDCT scans detect prevalent lung
cancer, when subsequent screening detects new nodules. However, adherence to screening is low, ranging at
28-38% from centers nationally. Multilevel interventions, which target patients, clinicians, and healthcare
systems, offer a promising framework to address the gaps in lung cancer screening to achieve guideline-
recommended lung cancer screening. Our mixed-methods pilot study with KPWA stakeholders two critical
components to improve adherence to repeat screening: providing education for patients on lung cancer
screening, and offering reminders for on-time return to screening. We developed two novel patient-centered
interventions using principles of human-centered design to address these needs: 1) Patient Voices Video that
incorporates patient testimonials to acknowledge receipt of screening, a tailored reminder of time due for next
scan, and reassurance to reduce fear of screening and role of loved ones to support health choices; and 2)
Stepped Reminders, that directly reminds patients when their next scan is due. Both interventions are
facilitated by a health system electronic health record (EHR) build to track patients for population health
management and a clinically-embedded medical assistant to deliver interventions. The goal of this proposal is
to test these two interventions relative to usual care to promote adherence to repeat screening in a pragmatic
cluster randomized trial enrolling 1775 adult KPWA members, who complete a screening LDCT in 2022-2025
across 34 KPWA primary care clinics in a 2x2 factorial-designed study. Study arms include: a) Stepped
Reminders alone; b) Patient Voices Video alone; c) both interventions; or d) usual care. To address our goals,
our specific aims are to: 1) Compare effectiveness of two multilevel interventions relative to usual care in
improving (a) rates of adherence to lung cancer screening, (b) patient-centered outcomes; and (c) clinic
outcomes; and 2) Determine the patient-, clinician-, and system-level factors that influence changes in
adherence to inform lung cancer screening programs. To date, no randomized clinical trial has evaluated
strategies to improve adherence to lung cancer screening in US populations with multilevel strategies. We will
move the field forward by providing effective, scalable interventions to improve lung cancer screening
adherence to achieve the population-based mortality benefits promised by large clinical trials that motivated
screening guidelines."

Diabetes is a leading cause of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), a cardiovascular complication characterized by
blood vessel regression, ischemia, mitochondrial dysfunction and limb myopathy. Classic angiogenic regulators
such as Vegfa, which have been a major focus of therapeutic interventions have proved to be inefficient clinically.
Consequently, pharmacological treatment of PAD has remained an unmet medical need, leading to limb
amputations in nearly 200,000 patients every year. Rehabilitative exercise has emerged as an effective clinical
strategy for managing PAD by virtue of its stimulatory effects on oxidative metabolism and vascularization in the
limb musculature. However, a common limitation of physical therapy is that majority of PAD patients, especially
ones with diabetes, cannot exercise due to severe leg pain or other cardiovascular complications. Therefore,
characterizing molecular regulation of metabolic and vascular remodeling in exercise and diabetes may present
novel targets for treating PAD. In this study, we will investigate the role of nuclear receptor estrogen-related
receptor alpha (ERR) in regulating metabolic capacity, vascular supply and exercise capacity in murine models
of exercise, diabetes and ischemia. We will also investigate mechanisms regulating ERR expression and
activity in the skeletal muscles. We hypothesize that (I) ERR is responsible for exercise-mediated metabolic
and vascular remodeling in the skeletal muscle, (II) overexpression of ERR in the skeletal muscles of diabetic
mice mitigates diabetic PAD-like pathology in absence of exercise, and (III) HIFs regulate ERR expression and
signaling in the skeletal muscle. The hypothesis will be tested in three aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate the role
of ERR in regulating metabolic and vascular characteristics of the limb musculature at baseline and in response
to exercise. In Aim 2, we will investigate whether ERR activation can mitigate PAD-like pathology in diabetic
mice. In Aim 3, we will investigate the function of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in the regulation of ERR
expression and activity in the skeletal muscle. For these studies, we will use muscle-specific targeting of ERR
in transgenic mice, as well as intramuscular AAV9-ERR delivery to examine effect on exercise, diabetes and
ischemic adaptations. In addition, we will use cellular mechanistic approach to further elucidate metabolic and
paracrine angiogenic regulation by muscle ERR, as well as regulation of ERR by HIFs. We expect our work
to demonstrate that ERR is a central regulator of muscle metabolic and vascular capacity in exercise, diabetes
and ischemia, and highlight ERR as a potential therapeutic candidate for treating diabetes-associated PAD."

Tobacco regulatory science (TRS) provides the evidence base needed to inform the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA's) regulatory actions and activities. In partnership with the National Institutes of Health
(NIH), FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) established a large, diverse, transdisciplinary research
portfolio that aims to advance TRS and generate scientific evidence that FDA CTP can use to inform tobacco
regulatory decision-making and protect public health. Additional TRS research is needed to address the
ongoing changes in the tobacco product landscape and to continue to understand the health effects and
related behaviors of the full complement of tobacco products. A strong and experienced coordinating center
will help ensure maximum achievement of these goals by providing scientific leadership and analytic expertise
to the research community; bringing researchers together to share methods, measures, data, and findings;
providing resources and infrastructure to facilitate collaboration; support TRS career development; and
disseminate research findings and relevant resources to the TRS community. The coordinating center will
serve as the hub to effectively and efficiently accelerate the impact of research from the TRS community.
Through this renewal application to serve as the Center for Coordination of Analysis, Science, Enhancement
and Logistics (CASEL), the Westat team proposes to build on our existing infrastructure, approaches,
experience and relationships to support the TRS research community and its Federal partners. Our specific
aims are to: (1) m
aintain a dynamic central hub that supports effective and coordinated collaboration and
engagement across the TRS community, NIH, and CTP partners; create synergies and provide valuable
resources to advance and accelerate timely high impact research
; (2) provide a robust logistical and
management infrastructure within a strong leadership framework for meaningful coordination of the large and
diverse portfolio of TRS research; (3) provide scientific leadership and facilitate timely responsiveness to
regulatory scientific priorities; (4) coordinate career enhancement activities across the CTP-funded research
community that increases research capacity and dissemination, provides mentorship and leadership
opportunities for early career scientists, facilitates education in diverse disciplines in TRS, and offers
networking and professional development resources; and (5) disseminate research resources to the TRS
community through multiple channels, synthesize research findings across the community, provide
opportunities to highlight emerging research findings, and coordinate information sharing to accelerate TRS.
We are prepared to step into CASEL 2.0 seamlessly, to enhance and expand our initiatives, and to introduce
nuanced, engaging innovation in our approaches. Our MPIs, Ms. Jeanne Rosenthal and Dr. Robin Mermelstein
have both served effectively in their respective senior management and scientific leadership roles and will
continue to oversee the work on the center, along with Core Leads, Dr. Cassandra Stanton and Dr. Andrea
Stroup and Program Manager, Ms. Miriam Galbraith. These leaders and our knowledgeable scientific and
administrative staff will work together to create a strong and supportive environment to foster and promote the
conduct of high quality TRS."

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is often associated with a clinical complication known
as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a major driver of mortality after allo-HCT. Current approaches to the
prophylaxis of GVHD are primarily immunosuppressive therapies that can dampen the intended activity of the
transplanted immune cells against the tumor and cause delayed immune reconstitution. Gastrointestinal (GI)
microbiota, the highest microbial colonization in the body, has long been understood to contribute to the
pathophysiology of GVHD. Indeed, patients undergoing allo-HCT are subject to dramatic immunological and
microbiota perturbations, developing pre-HCT and continuing during transplant; GI microbiome diversity before
and after transplant are independently associated with clinical outcome. When GVHD occurs, the GI tract is
frequently involved, and patients often succumb to GVHD. New approaches to prevent GVHD and other
transplant-related complications are urgently needed. We hypothesize that restoring the health of the intestinal
microbial community early post-HCT is feasible and associated with improved transplant outcomes and immune
reconstitution. In 2 studies of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in allo-HCT, our group reported that an FMT
intervention is a safe way to restore microbiota diversity. However, FMT has batch-to-batch variability depending
on specific donors and carries the risks of transmission of infectious organisms or antibiotic-resistance genes.
Here, we propose an entirely novel approach: a rationally designed oral-ecobiotic capsule that delivers a defined
composition of pure bacterial strains. An oral, defined blend of strains offers advantages of predictable and
reproducible pharmacology and would be immediately scalable to future studies. On this multi-PI proposal, we
will capitalize on samples from an ongoing, investigator-initiated multicenter placebo-controlled phase 1b trial,
led by PI Doris Ponce, which is first-in-human evaluating a clonally-derived multi-strain bacterial consortia for
the prevention and restoration of the GI microbiome (NCT04995653). Our group has shown in a large multicenter
study that early intestinal microbiome dysbiosis occurred universally among centers and had an association with
transplant outcomes. In addition, innovative preclinical models of microbiome dysbiosis serve as the basis for
the translational study and proposed microbiome analyses. Project objectives: Along with PI Marcel van den
Brink, to evaluate the effects of intestinal microbiota restoration in allo-HCT recipients. We will pursue 2 specific
aims that will evaluate the effects of microbiome restoration in the GI microbiome, allo-HCT outcomes, and
immune reconstitution. Expected outcome: Results will provide new mechanistic insights into interactions
between the intestinal microbiome and host immunity. Impact: Findings will inform future research not only for
the reduction of transplant-related complications including GVHD, but also for other conditions in which GI injury
occurs such as chemotherapy and/or radiation-induced toxicity and non-malignant inflammatory GI conditions.
The proposed project outlines an entirely novel framework for targeting the GI microbiome in HCT."
10765698,"The accumulation of insoluble and misfolded proteins is commonly associated with degeneration of neurons in
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients. Heat shock proteins (HSPs)
play a central role in the regulation of protein homeostasis by facilitating effective folding, trafficking, and
degradation of both nascent and aged polypeptides. While it has become increasingly clear that perturbations in
in the proteostasis network play a significant role in ALS/FTD, limited emphasis has been placed on investigating
the direct causal relationship between the functionality of HSPs and disease pathogenesis. Heterozygous, loss-
of-function mutations in the DNAJC7 gene, which encodes for the HSP40 protein DNAJC7 have recently been
identified as a cause for rare forms of ALS. The DNAJC7 protein acts as a co-chaperone for HSP70 chaperones,
thereby facilitating HSP70-polypeptide interactions and appropriate polypeptide folding. However, little is known
about the specific function of DNAJC7 in the central nervous system and motor neurons specifically, the cell type
that predominantly degenerates in ALS patients. Our primary hypothesis is that DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency leads
to the accumulation of misfolded HSP70 client proteins resulting in the disruption of biological processes critical
to the function and survival of vulnerable MNs. Here, we will use mutant DNAJC7 cellular models, patient induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical and spinal motor neurons and CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing, in
combination with mass spectrometry (MS)-based quantitative proteomics and RNA-Sequencing to elucidate how
ALS/FTD-associated mutations in DNAJC7 contribute towards neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. In Aim 1
we will determine the endogenous interactome of DNAJC7 in mutant and isogenic control human neurons to
better understand the functional role that it plays in postmitotic cells. In Aim 2 we will methodically characterize
disruptions in protein folding caused by pathogenic DNAJC7 using two independent MS-based proteomics
approaches. These experiments will provide an unbiased proteome-wide interrogation of fundamental aspects
of proteostasis in ALS-DNAJC7 mutant and isogenic control neurons. In Aim 3, which is based on our preliminary
finding that DNAJC7 interacts with the ALS-casual RNA-metabolism proteins FUS and MATR3, we will
investigate how DNAJC7 mutations affect RNA processing in patient neurons. Taken together, our proposed
aims will shed light upon the cellular mechanisms that are compromised by DNAJC7 haploinsufficiency in distinct
human cortical and spinal neurons. Our findings will impact the field by contributing towards the understanding
of HSP-dependent proteostasis mechanisms in human neurons as well as to how rare ALS genetic mutations
lead to neuron dysfunction and loss. Identifying novel proteins that are susceptible to misfolding in human
neurons might highlight cellular pathways critical for ALS/FTD pathophysiology."

River blindness (onchocerciasis) is a major neglected chronic tropical disease that has been selected by the
WHO for elimination by 2030. Currently, international control programs attempt to interrupt transmission of
infection with annual mass drug administration (MDA), over the 10-14 years lifetime of the adult worms, using
the microfilaricidal drug ivermectin that kills the microfilariae (mf) of Onchocerca volvulus, the causative agent of
onchocerciasis. However, MDA with ivermectin is confounded in Africa because it cannot be used in areas co-
endemic for loiasis due to the risk of severe adverse events. The overall goal of our project is to develop a novel
direct macrofilaricidal (lethal to adult worms directly) preclinical candidate drug as targeted therapy for
onchocerciasis using a multidimensional interdisciplinary experimental approach.
 Our proposal is based on two main resources we have established: a) an extensive omics resource that
allowed the identification of defined conserved and diversified essential molecular targets in adult filarial worms,
and b) a multifaceted screening funnel that was used successfully to phenotypically screen in vitro a library of
drugs approved for clinical use, resulting in the identification of drugs with macrofilaricidal activity. In silico
prioritization interfaced with the experimental identification of drugs that were active against the adult stage of
filarial nematodes resulted in a short list of inhibitors with known drug-indication and putative target indication
pairs that form the basis for our rational optimization of new compounds with direct macrofilaricidal potential.
 Our proposed aims thus build on our significant progress starting with validating the canonical targets in
filarial nematodes, further expanding the list of our five high priority hit scaffolds with similar compounds by using
pharmacophore searches, followed by discovery and rational design of innovative adult filarial nematode-
selective drugs. The newly synthesized compounds will be optimized for potency and selectivity against the
parasites vs. the host as well as against the cognate filarial nematode targets using a systems biology approach.
We will also confirm the mode of action for the most promising lead compounds which will also be assessed for
in vivo efficacy in two filarial small animal models that we have developed to facilitate assessing drug candidates
in vivo (Brugia pahangi/jirds and Onchocerca ochengi/jirds).
 The overall approach deploys iterative optimization of two chemical series of compounds, and by the end
of the project we plan to have at least one macrofilaricidal drug candidate to move into late stage preclinical
studies. Overall, this project will emphatically address a critical research and thus operational gap; the
identification and development of novel potent and safe macrofilaricidal drugs. Our rational discovery approach
has the potential of providing macrofilaricidal drugs that kill directly adult worms needed to achieve the elimination
goals for the human onchocerciasis."

The neurodegeneration in the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia that leads to Parkinson's disease (PD)
produces a progressive decline in walking function. A major barrier limiting effective walking interventions in
people with PD is the occurrence of insufficient motor learning. In the absence of disease modifying options,
dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation are often used as the disease progresses. Although
effective at improving gait, these solutions are temporary, concealing the concurrent degeneration of
dopaminergic neurons. As a result, these solutions become less effective at improving gait as the disease
progresses and can wear off later in the day. Physical therapy has the potential to increase walking capacity as
well as create long-term improvements through intensive training that focuses on motor learning. In particular,
the use of rhythmic auditory cues is a well-established intervention that attempts to overcome the damage to
internal cueing mechanisms. Despite consistent benefits observed immediately after training, the long-term
(retention) effects are more mixed. We contend that reduced retention is a result of inadequate motor learning.
Conventional rhythmic auditory cueing employs strategic (explicit) learning with use-dependent learning. To add
implicit learning mechanisms to rhythmic auditory cueing, a subtle error in the tempo can be introduced that
requires recalibration (i.e., error-based learning). We propose that the addition of frequent movement
recalibrations via subconscious temporal distortions of rhythmic auditory cues will repeatedly engage the early
phase of implicit learning for individuals with PD to involve intact neural pathways (i.e., hippocampal driven
encoding) for improved motor learning and longer term retention of gait improvements. As this training has the
potential to alter neural circuitry, we will assess the neural substrates induced by this intervention through
multimodal markers of hippocampal and striatal structure and connectivity. Specifically, we will use a randomized
controlled design to perform four weeks of gait training using either no metronome, a metronome with a fixed
tempo (strategic learning), or a metronome with a slowly changing tempo (strategic learning + error-based
learning). In Aim 1, we will assess the gait behavioral changes post-training and at a 3-month follow-up to
determine retention. In Aim 2, we will explore structural and functional neural changes induced by the gait training
interventions. Our team is exceptionally well prepared to perform these Aims, consisting of experts in gait
neurorehabilitation and biomechanics (Lewek), motor learning and neuroimaging (Dayan), and Parkinson's
disease clinical care (Browner). At the conclusion of this project, we will have determined the available
mechanisms of motor learning for people with PD, and will have examined the neural substrates that can be
targeted to maximize remaining intact neural circuitry. This project has the potential to alter the manner in which
rehabilitation is performed with people with PD, using a disease specific motor learning paradigm that makes
use of residual neural circuits for long-term retention of functional motor skills."

ABSTRACT
Although bipolar I disorder is a dynamic condition expressing a wide range of affective, cognitive and
neurovegetative symptoms, it is defined by the occurrence of mania. Mania typically first emerges in
adolescence and young adulthood, and it is a strongly predictive phenotype. Moreover, the early course of
bipolar I disorder is progressive, as euthymic periods shorten over time. Additionally, bipolar I disorder is
strongly familial with heritability rates approaching 85%. A family history of bipolar I disorder increases risk
for mania as well as a number of other psychiatric conditions, including suicidal behaviors and reward
hypersensitivity. Together, these characteristics suggest that bipolar I disorder results from an inherited
failure during adolescence to develop healthy neural systems that modulate mood and behavioral activation.
Complicating the inherited risk is that people with a family history of bipolar disorder also report higher rates
of early life adversity than the general population. Early life adversity is associated with lifelong elevated
rates of depression, anxiety and substance use disorders, impaired risk-reward processing, and suicide.
Consequently, during development individuals with a familial risk for bipolar I disorder may be exposed to a
dual risk, i.e. an inherited vulnerability and environmental early-life stress. How these risks interact to impact
brain development and subsequent outcomes in these individuals is not known.
 Mood and risk-reward behaviors are managed by intersecting ventral prefrontal networks. These
networks undergo substantial development in the transition from adolescence to young adulthood (when
bipolar I disorder emerges) in which maturation of prefrontal networks leads to adaptive adult emotional
regulation and risk-reward processing. Abnormalities in these networks are commonly described in both
bipolar disorder and in response to early life adversity, with many shared characteristics. With these
considerations in mind, we hypothesize that heritability for bipolar I disorder interacts with early life adversity
to synergistically disrupt healthy ventral prefrontal network development during adolescence, underlying a
cumulative increased risk for developing mania and other conditions more common in bipolar families. To
test this hypothesis, over a four-year interval we will assess trajectories in ventral prefrontal network
connectivity in youth at-familial-risk for bipolar I disorder compared to those without this risk, and the
interaction with or without early life trauma, to determine whether these risks cumulatively lead to increasing
emergence of: 1) mood symptoms and syndromes, 2) substance misuse, 3) suicidal behaviors, and 4)
approach motivation hypersensitivity. These results can inform future approaches to prevent illness onset
and progression in individuals at risk for or early in the course of bipolar disorder.

As life expectancy increases age-associated pathologies have become a major health problem.
It is now recognized that stem cell aging is a driver of systemic and organ-specific functional
decline. In the hematopoietic system stem cell aging is characterized by accumulation of
immunophenotypically-defined hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with impaired self-renewal
capacity and altered differentiation programs with increased generation of myeloid populations
and decreased lymphoid potential. Here we show that genetic loss of Plant Homeodomain
Factor 6 (PHF6) results in increased HSC serial transplantation capacity and abrogates the
development of age-associated hematopoietic decay including the accumulation of functionally
exhausted HSCs displaying myeloid differentiation bias and impaired lymphoid potential. Our
central hypothesis is that loss of Phf6 reconfigures the epigenetic landscape of HSCs blocking
the initiation and/or progression of age-associated functional decline. Here we will apply the
combined expertise of the Ferrando and Rabadan labs in hematopoiesis and computational
biology to explore in depth the hematopoietic phenotypes and mechanisms of PHF6 inactivation
in HSC aging. Towards this goal we will analyze the stem cell compartment in Phf6 conditional
knockout mice and after CRISPR-directed PHF6 inactivation in human hematopoietic stem
cells, leveraging in vitro and in vivo stem cell assays in combination with advanced
computational analytical tools applied to single cell transcriptomics and epigenomics. These
studies will ultimately facilitate the development of new targeted therapies aimed at improving
the engraftment capacity of hematopoietic stem cells from aged donors and for the treatment of
pathologies resulting from age-associated HSC deterioration."
10872278,"The prepubertal gonadal hormone surge that primes the rapid social and emotional development of
adolescence has specific influences on female brains that may account for the accelerated risk for disordered
eating and development of binge eating in girls relative to boys. We propose to test a model of sex differences
in the risk for binge eating in early adolescence that emphasizes the differential influence of gonadal hormone
status on the development of functional brain networks in girls relative to boys to account for the enhanced risk
during this vulnerable period. The model leverages general brain arousal theory to predict the effect of gonadal
hormones on functional brain networks, and builds on theoretical work by the MPI, seminal work by Dr. Kelly
Klump and colleagues on moderated genetic risks for disordered eating in twin studies, and the pioneering
work of Dr. Donald Pfaff and colleagues on the activating effects of gonadal hormones.
 The specific aims of this R01 project are two-fold: 1) to test for sex differences in the mediation of
binge eating risk by gonadal hormonal influences on brain networks for arousal, reward processing, emotional
salience, and inhibitory control at baseline and longitudinally over 2-year follow-up; and 2) to develop a
computational model of general brain arousal to explain sex differences in the risk for binge eating in early
adolescence. The central hypotheses are that (i) gonadal hormone status will predict the developmental
status of functional brain networks for arousal, reward processing, emotional salience, and inhibitory control
longitudinally in girls but not boys; (ii) these neuroendocrine interactions will mediate the risk for binge eating
longitudinally in girls but not boys; and (iii) gonadal hormone status will predict covariation between these brain
networks in girls but not boys, suggesting a sexually dimorphic mechanism for gonadal hormones to influence
a range of behaviors characterized by altered responses to salient, rewarding, and stressful environmental
cues. The large set of clinical, endocrine, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected for
the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study at baseline and follow-up presents an ideal
mechanism to test this model of sex differences in risk for binge eating during the critical developmental period
in early puberty when gonadal hormone levels surge and maladaptive eating behaviors first emerge.

 Chronic stress alters reward-related behavior and this is accompanied by changes in neural
circuit function, especially that involving the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However, the
molecular mechanisms controlling circuit dysfunction and its effect on associated behaviors
remain poorly understood.
 The Npas4 gene encodes the Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (NPAS4) transcription factor
that functions as a homeostatic regulator of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections in
response to changes in synaptic activity. Our preliminary findings in mice show that aversive
stress experience trigger the transient induction of NPAS4 expression in mPFC and that this is
required for chronic social defeat stress (CSDS)-induced reward-related behavior deficit.
Furthermore, these studies show that NPAS4 is required for CSDS-induced reduction of mPFC
pyramidal neuron excitatory transmission and dendritic spine density.
 Interestingly, while protein-coding genes (mRNA) are obviously important for functional
regulation of brain activity, human and rodent genomes encode a much larger number of long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Emerging evidence demonstrates significant roles for lncRNAs in
gene expression, but the physiological and pathological functions of individual lncRNAs are only
beginning to be explored. To address this knowledge gap, we will study a novel, non-annotated,
lnc-enhancer RNA (lnc-eRNA) transcribed from the enhancer region of Npas4 (Npas4eRNA). We
found that Npas4eRNA is required for Npas4mRNA expression and for CSDS-induced deficits in
sucrose preference. Npas4eRNA forms an DNA:RNA hybrid R-loop structure that is required for
Npas4mRNA expression. We hypothesize that the Npas4eRNA and its R-loop structure directly link
the enhancer-associated transcriptional machinery with the Npas4 transcription start site via 3D
chromatin loop structure.
 In this proposal, we will combine innovative molecular and cellular approaches with
ethologically relevant models of psychosocial and psychological stressors in both male and
female mice and examine the function of Npas4eRNA and R-loop in the PFC for the stress-induced
epigenetic gene regulation, functional and morphological synaptic plasticity, and alterations in
reward-related behaviors."

Injury is the leading cause of loss of independence among those over the age 65, resulting in over 3 million
Emergency Department (ED) visits, 800,000 hospitalizations, and greater than $50 billion in costs each year.
Guideline-concordant triage of trauma patients – rapid identification of those with severe injuries and transfer to
trauma centers – decreases mortality by 10 to 25%, reduces loss of independence, and diminishes pain at one
year. Despite this evidence, under-triage persists (incidence: 50%), particularly among those over the age of
65 (incidence: 80%). Causes of non-compliance with clinical practice guidelines varies among physicians.
Moreover, exposing physicians to inappropriate interventions can have serious unintended consequences. To
address the implementation gap, we therefore propose to develop a novel serious game (an applied video
game) to measure physician behavior in trauma triage and to identify sources of non-compliance. In Aim 1, we
will build the game using an established, user-centered design process that involves formative research with
stakeholders (n=20), prototype development, and then calibration through iterative play-testing with a national
convenience sample of physicians (n=30). In Aim 2, we will establish the initial measurement properties of the
game by recruiting a local convenience sample of physicians (n=100), auditing their charts, and conducting
semi-structured interviews so that we can assess internal consistency reliability, re-test reliability, criterion
validity, and convergent construct validity. This proposal will deliver a tool that can be used to inform the
selection of interventions in future efforts to increase the implementation of guidelines in trauma triage, and
thereby to improve patient outcomes after injury."

One third of American adults are suffering from obesity. Obesity significantly contributes
to the prevalence of numerous other life-threatening diseases, such as type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases, cancers, etc. Although substantial resources have been
invested to resolve this major public health threat, the fact is that, currently, only limited
methods of pharmacological therapeutics have been developed to treat obesity. An in-
depth understanding of the reasons for obesity is urgently needed to facilitate finding
more effective therapeutics. There are two types of fat tissue in humans: white and
brown adipose tissue. They have different morphologies and perform distinct functions.
While white fat stores excessive energy in the form of lipids, brown fat consumes
excessive energy through adaptive thermogenesis (i.e., generating heat). A common
phenomenon in human obesity is the conversion of brown fat into white fat, a process
identified as whitening. Reversing brown fat whitening activates brown fat function and
exerts anti-obesity effects. The overarching goal of this study is to investigate the role of
lipocalin 2 (LCN-2), a potential factor that promotes brown fat whitening. The applicant
recently performed a series of screenings in his adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction
model. LCN-2 was suggested to be a leading factor that drives the white to brown
adipose tissue crosstalk to induce brown fat whitening. Therefore, this proposal is set out
to evaluate the central hypotheses: LCN-2, a secreting factor from the white fat, is
induced by mitochondrial distress and promotes brown fat whitening. In Aim 1, cell
culture systems (in vitro) will be utilized to demonstrate that LCN-2 is required in brown
fat whitening. In Aim 2, evidence from mice (in vivo) will be provided to further evaluate
the role of LCN-2 in brown fat whitening and metabolic consequences (i.e., cold
intolerance and obesity). This study will fill a knowledge gap through defining a novel
whitening factor in understanding how the brown adipose tissue becomes whitened.
Furthermore, this study has translational merits because either neutralization of LCN-2
per se or inhibition of the LCN-2 receptor holds an enormous potential to ameliorate
brown AT whitening and, in turn, to identify innovative therapeutics that alleviate obesity."

Chronic posterior eye diseases, such as diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema (ME) caused by
retinal vein occlusion, wet age-released macular degeneration (wet AMD) and non-infectious posterior uveitis
(NU), are associated with high rates irreversible vision loss. Current standard of care for DME, ME and wet
AMD is monthly intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody,
Bevacizumab (Bev), or the fragment, Ranibizumab (Ran). In addition, because those diseases are
characterized by inflammation and fibrosis, intravitreal corticosteroid implant injections every 2~6 months is the
mainstay to treat DME, ME, and NU. Recently, combination therapy of intravitreal anti-VEGF and corticosteroid
implant (Ozurdex) injections has been extensively studied in clinical trials to expect better therapeutic efficacy
in those chronic diseases. However, multiple frequent intravitreal injections are not only invasive and
inconvenient for patients but also increase the risk of complications, such as conjunctival hemorrhage, and
increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Especially, the intravitreal corticosteroid treatment causes serious local
side effects, such as cataract and abnormally high IOP which can lead to glaucoma. Because the peak IOP is
highly associated with the drug (dexamethasone, Dex) concentration in the vitreous/retina released from
Ozurdex, we hypothesize that the local side effect is due to the inability to adjust dosage and burst release
characterized by high concentration in shorter time than desired. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
our novel dose-controllable co-delivery implant of Dex/Ran would reduce the side effects due to uncontrollable
dosage after intravitreal administration, and extend therapeutic efficacy. We recently developed a
biodegradable light-activated implant that can be intravitreally injected and triggered by laser through the lens
of the eye for dose-controlled drug release safely. The drug dosage can be precisely and easily controlled by
varying laser parameters, such as power and duration. The overall goal of this research is to improve the
treatment of chronic posterior eye diseases and reduce side effects caused by current corticosteroid treatment
methods by developing a dose-controllable co-delivery drug implant. The focus of Aim 1 is to complete the
development of a dose-controllable co-delivery Dex/Ran implant and investigate the drug release kinetics in
vitro. Aim 2 focuses on defining effect of different drug delivery methods on reducing side effects, glaucoma,
utilizing human trabecular meshwork cells. Aim 3 will determine in vivo efficacy and reduced side effects of the
implant compared to the traditional methods, i.e. Ozurdex and monthly Ran injections, in a retinal vessel
leakage/edema rabbit model. At the successful completion of this project, expected outcomes include
identifying feasibility of the dose-controllable implants to potentially change the standard of care for chronic
posterior eye drug delivery. In addition, the project will support future R01 application by generating preliminary
data and enhance the PI to be an independent researcher in the field of translational science."

One in six pregnancies is affected by some form of gestational diabetes (GD), a prevalence that is steadily rising
in the context of the worldwide epidemics of obesity and early diabetic onset. Early diagnosis and advances in
maternal glucose control have greatly mitigated the perinatal consequences of gestational diabetes on the
mothers and their offspring. However, these advances have only marginally impacted its long-term
consequences. As such, exposure to hyperglycemia in utero remains associated with increased long-term
morbidities in offspring. The mechanisms driving this pathological transmission across generations have not
been established. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) of the
offspring are stably altered by gestational diabetes and are essential “effectors” of the long-term pathological
effects of gestational diabetes in offspring. Our preliminary data established two reliable mouse models of
gestational diabetes that reproduce not only the perinatal adverse features of the human pathology, but also its
long-term consequence in adult offspring. In these models, we show that gestational diabetes alters the
hematopoiesis of the offspring and that this effect persists to adulthood, even in absence of overt diabetes. This
phenotype indicates the acquisition of a long-lasting memory of metabolic events by the most upstream
hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartments. Importantly, our results also indicate that hematopoietic
alterations present in offspring can contribute to pathologies, such as atherosclerosis. Here we propose to
investigate the interplay between gestational diabetes and the hematopoietic system. Based on our preliminary
data, we will determine in aim 1 how signaling through the receptor of advanced glycation end products (RAGE)
contributes to the acquisition of a diabetic hematopoietic memory in GD offspring. In aim 2, we will establish the
epigenetic modifications that underlie the long-term maintenance of this hematopoietic memory in adult GD
offspring. Our work will decipher the mechanisms underlying the hematopoietic memory associated with
gestational diabetes. Defining these mechanisms will establish potential biomarkers for diabetic hematopoietic
memory. it will also reveal new therapeutic targets to alter the trajectory of the hematopoietic memory and prevent
its long-term pathological consequences."

Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the US, a top killer of Americans, and impacts Mexican
Americans (MAs) to a greater extent than non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). One opportunity to improve stroke
outcomes and reduce disparities may exist through identification and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea
(OSA) in individuals with stroke. OSA in the general population is heterogeneous with respect to
pathophysiology, expression of disease, response to therapies, and association with outcomes. Mechanistic
causes of airway collapse during sleep can be categorized from polysomnography (PSG) data as OSA
endotypes, including an anatomic cause (collapsibility), and 3 non-anatomic causes (pharyngeal muscle
compensation, chemoreflex feedback loop/loop gain, and arousal threshold). Unlike traditional PSG data that
reflect OSA severity and not underlying cause, these endotypes determine response to treatments, and thus
new PSG-based methods to determine endotypes create novel opportunities for personalized care. OSA is
overrepresented after stroke (~75%) and manifests differently compared to the general population.
Furthermore, OSA is more prevalent and severe among MA stroke patients, who on average have a higher
BMI than NHWs, and therefore likely more airway collapsibility. Reasons for the high prevalence and the
mechanistic causes of post-stroke OSA are unknown. Due to interruption of brain pathways, non-anatomical
causes of OSA may be more likely after stroke than in the general population. In contrast, stroke cases with
pre-existing OSA may have endotypes more similar to the general population, with greater contribution from
collapsibility. Leveraging the infrastructure of a longstanding population-based study (BASIC) and its ancillary
study for subject identification, baseline data collection, and baseline PSG, this prospective study with a stroke-
free comparison group, with longitudinal follow-up seeks to: 1) determine specific endotypes and endotypic
profiles that contribute to post-stroke OSA, and how these differ by ethnicity and from those without stroke, 2)
determine how specific endotypic profiles relate to improvement in OSA severity typically observed early after
stroke in order to inform which patients may need longer-term treatment and which may need repeat testing for
OSA, and 3) build a model to predict post-stroke OSA endotypic profiles based on clinical information including
phenotypic data, to assist in selection of most appropriate treatment options without the need for PSG. Newly
proposed facial morphometric measures and other phenotyping will complement the rich demographic and
clinical data for consideration as predictors of post-stroke OSA endotypic profiles. This study will expand our
understanding of the pathophysiology of post-stroke OSA and open the door to personalized medicine for
stroke patients, currently dominated by a one-size-fits-all approach."

facilitative for bilingual children. Proposed studies will move theories of bilingualism and of CSWL forward by

10782478,"The APOE-ε4 (APOE4) variant is the greatest single risk factor for developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease  (AD); however, its involvement in AD is poorly understood. Recently DAB1 was identified as the only genome-wide significant locus in homozygous APOE4 (e4/e4) individuals in the UK Biobank. DAB1's involvement in AD  was profoundly dependent on the e4/e4 genotype and also the DAB1 SNP zygosity, which influenced the  probability of developing AD and the age of onset. Based on this, we hypothesize that there is a genetic  interaction between APOE4 and DAB1 that synergistically augments the likelihood of AD. Both APOE4 and  DAB1 act on the endocytosis-signaling receptors in the APOE-receptor family and have consequences for Aβ  accumulation and microtubule binding protein τ (MAPT) phosphorylation pointing to potential functional  overlap. DAB1 is an obligate adaptor protein on the REELIN signaling pathway that is well characterized for its  roles in brain development. The Reln gene has been shown to impact AD-related phenotypes in mouse models  of the disease, and in the APOE4 study RELN was nominally associated with AD in e4/e4 individuals pointing  to a broader involvement of the RELN-DAB1 pathway in AD. We propose that determining the Dab1 dosage-dependent, AD-related phenotypes that are exaggerated by APOE4 in mouse and culture models will help elucidate how these genes contribute to the increased risk of the disease. We will investigate this by pursuing  the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1. To determine if Dab1 heterozygosity alters early and/or late AD-like pathology in an APOE variant-dependent manner. Specific Aim 2. To determine if Dab1-gene dose influences APOE4-dependent endocytic aberrations. Our long  term goal is to resolve how DAB1 and other  REELIN pathway genes influence APOE4 biology as a means to understand how this apolipoprotein and  defects in endocytosis contribute to the progression of AD."
10890067,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) has been reported in more than 50% of older adults and is strongly
associated with 5 year mortality. Unfortunately, a key weakness of prior research on OD in
aging is that it comes primarily from broad population health surveys using limited screening tests
for OD. The result is that currently there are no methods for organizing patients with OD in aging
based on either disease site or mechanism. Various anatomic sites along the olfactory pathway
may be involved in OD in aging, including the nasal cavity, olfactory neuroepithelium, olfactory
nerves, cribriform plate, and central olfactory structures. At these anatomic sites, OD then likely
occurs through distinct mechanisms that will be associated with unique olfactory-specific
biomarkers. Although prior studies have been instrumental in demonstrating that OD is highly
prevalent in older individuals, most were not designed to comprehensively evaluate the olfactory-
specific measures that would allow classification into subtypes of OD. Our hypothesis is that
patients with OD in aging can be grouped into clinically relevant phenotypes based on
anatomic sites of dysfunction that will provide important mechanistic insights. Our long
term objective is to develop better diagnostic protocols and personalized treatments for patients
with OD in aging. However, in order to develop targeted treatments one must first be able to
classify patients based on the underlying site of disease and likely mechanism. This hypothesis
will be tested using the following Aims: 1) Establish reliable and clinically relevant phenotypes of
OD in older adults, 2) Determine the impact of OD on health and quality of life (QOL) in older
adults, and 3) Determine which baseline factors predict olfactory changes over time in older
adults. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has a stated its
interest in this area, “as the population ages, (to) determine how many more people report…smell
problems that affect quality of life.” This proposal will improve our understanding of clinical
classifications, mechanisms, QOL impact and natural history of OD in older adults and lay the
groundwork for future studies examining therapeutic options to prevent, delay the onset or treat
OD in aging."

Many of the organophosphate (OP) anticholinesterases, such as nerve agents, are highly toxic. Terrorist
actions or accidents involving OPs could lead to mass casualties with potentially high levels of lethality. The
current therapy consists of the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine and an oxime reactivator of the
inhibited acetylcholinesterase (2-PAM in the US). However, 2-PAM is not always effective at saving lives and
cannot effectively penetrate the blood brain barrier, so 2-PAM can leave victims poorly protected. An improved
oxime therapeutic is needed to counteract nerve agent lethality and assist with neuroprotection, so that both
life and brain function may be preserved. Our laboratories have invented, patented and licensed a platform of
substituted phenoxyalkyl pyridinium oximes that have shown better survival efficacy than 2-PAM and, unlike 2-
PAM, attenuation of signs of seizure-like behavior and neuropathology in rats exposed to high levels of highly
relevant nerve agent surrogates. Limited studies in male guinea pigs against sarin have also shown efficacy.
With our current CounterACT Lead Identification U01 the efficacious compounds (the “actives”) have been
down-selected to a lead and an alternate, with Oxime 20 being proposed as the Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredient (API). The proposed project will build on the present survival efficacy, pharmacokinetic and API
toxicity information in rats. Initially a superior vehicle for the API will be developed as a better solvent for the
lipophilic API. A pharmacodynamic aim (Aim 1) will determine in rats (both sexes) whether a lower dosage of
the API will be effective in promoting survival of lethal dosages of a sarin surrogate (nitrophenyl isopropyl
methylphosphonate, NIMP; a G agent chemistry) and a VX surrogate (nitrophenyl ethyl methylphosphonate,
NEMP; a V agent chemistry) alone or in combination with 2-PAM. A pharmacokinetic (PK) aim (Aim 2) will
determine the PK of the API in the new vehicle, plasma protein binding and hepatic microsomal metabolism in
rats of both sexes and will introduce studies of a larger non-rodent test species, the Gottingen minipig, both
sexes. An oxime toxicity aim (Aim 3) will investigate dose responses of the API for gross pathological,
histopathological, clinical chemistry and hematology adverse results in rats and minipigs of both sexes to
identify a Maximum Tolerated Dosage and a No Observed Adverse Effect Level, as well as in vitro genotoxicity
and drug-drug interactions for CYPs and transporters. A chemistry aim (Aim 4) will support the previous 3 aims
by providing the synthesis of NIMP, NEMP and the API, produce a new vehicle with improved solvent
properties, evaluate API stability, and provide initial plans for manufacturing and Chemical Manufacturing
Controls. All studies will be non-GLP and will follow FDA guidance from pre-IND meetings. The overarching
goal of this Lead Optimization project is to provide optimized pharmacological and toxicological information on
our lead oxime in both sexes of two species that will prepare the API to move into advanced development
toward FDA approval."

10877181,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this proposal is to characterize the molecular mechanisms that specify, maintain, and
protect a discrete compartment of pre-patterned but quiescent and undifferentiated progenitor cells
(termed the “Neck”) in the tunicate Ciona. Tunicates like Ciona are the invertebrates most closely
related to vertebrates, and possess a unique biphasic life cycle alternating between a short-lived,
motile larva and a sessile adult. During metamorphosis, a mass wave of programmed cell death
eliminates most differentiated larval cells while sparing set-aside undifferentiated adult progenitor cells
that go on to form the majority of adult cell types and structures. Despite this heterochrony in
differentiation and the complete remodeling of the post-metamorphic adult, the larval and adult body
plans are contiguous and simultaneously patterned during embryonic development.
This peculiar arrangement offers a unique opportunity to study how discrete stem cell compartments
can be set aside and protected for later developmental potential in spite of the differentiation and cell
death around them. The central hypothesis is that the stereotyped specification, maintenance, and
survival of quiescent progenitor cells of the Neck are controlled by precise developmental regulation of
genes encoding rate-limiting components of diverse biochemical pathways. The rationale underlying
the proposed research is that, by exploiting the genomic and cellular simplicity of Ciona and their
radical yet naturally stereotyped transition from a motile larval body plan to a sessile adult one, we can
understand tissue remodeling and cellular turnover in much greater spatial and temporal detail.
The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) We will test whether Pax2/5/8
is required for establishing the Neck as a discrete compartment of adult progenitor cells. 2) We will
test the roles of FGF and Hedgehog signaling in maintaining Neck cells as a quiescent population of
undifferentiated cells. 3) We will test whether the survival of Neck cells during the wave of apoptosis
that occurs in metamorphosis requires the anti-apoptotic effects of Nitric oxide signaling and a unique
class of metalloproteins that bind vanadium, a heavy metal that has been observed to accumulate in
tunicate cells but without a known biological function. These aims will be pursued using an innovative
approach that combines cell lineage-specific CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic gene knockouts with next-
generation sequencing, in vivo fluorescence microscopy and in vitro biochemical assays. The
expected outcomes of the proposed work would be to 1) reveal conserved biological mechanisms that
might be shared with humans, and/or 2) identify highly divergent proteins and pathways that could
nonetheless be harnessed for novel therapeutic tools to treat human disease and injury."
10818527,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Improved treatment strategies for patients with cancer require enhanced tools to better predict patient response,
model clonal heterogeneity, and identify novel treatment options for individual patients. Patient-derived cancer
organoids (PDCOs) are a major advance providing more representative models of the human disease, including
the maintenance of molecular alterations, cell-cell communication, and the 3D architecture found in cancers. Our
groups have significant experience using PDCOs to predict treatment response for patients across cancer types.
These models, however, have unique challenges when used for translational studies, including (1) heterogeneity
between organoids from the same patient, (2) assessment techniques that require sample fixation or reagents
that prevent time-course studies of clonal evolution, and (3) lack of single organoid assessment and low-
throughput culture techniques that limit screens for new drugs.
We have developed optical metabolic imaging (OMI) using two-photon (2P) microscopy to measure treatment
response without a need for reagents (e.g., dyes, labels) or fixation. Our prior studies demonstrated that 2P OMI
can predict treatment response for patients with cancer. However, 2P microscopy is high cost, low throughput,
and complex to operate. To expand the use of OMI across multi-center translational studies of PDCOs, more
readily accessible imaging and analysis methods are needed for high/moderate throughput drug screening and
assessments of organoid metabolic heterogeneity over time. To enhance the accessibility of this technology to
more laboratories and facilitate the expanded use of PDCOs, we have developed a one-photon wide-field (WF)
OMI technique with single-organoid tracking and leading-edge segmentation methods for significantly reduced
cost, reduced complexity, and increased throughput compared to 2P microscopy.
The goal of this proposal is to validate WF OMI techniques for PDCOs that can be widely used for patient
treatment planning, heterogeneity analyses, and new drug development. OMI non-invasively images
response in a 3D sample using the intrinsic fluorescence of the metabolic co-enzymes NAD(P)H and FAD. OMI
can dynamically quantify heterogeneous drug response over a treatment time-course. We have and will continue
to develop hundreds of PDCO lines from metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. These cultures will be
used to validate new methods for more widely accessible OMI tools to predict patient response, identify
metabolic/genetic heterogeneity that underlies resistance to targeted therapy, and perform screens of new drug
candidates. The completion of this work will create technologies to perform high-sensitivity patient-matched drug
screens in a clinical setting, predict the evolution of drug resistance for individual patients, and perform new drug
development in samples that reflect the diversity of human cancers."

Kindlin-2 (K2) is the most broadly distributed of the three mammalian kindlins. It is present in fibrobasts,
chondrocytes, and cardiomocytes, and its global knockout is embryonically lethal. As shown herein, K2 is
highly expressed in the three key cells of blood vessels, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and pericytes,
where it contributes to the functional responses of these cells. Yet, our information on the role of K2 in these
cells is rudimentary with many gaps in knowledge that we will seek to fill. The most well-accepted function of
K2 relates to its essential role in integrin activation, but with more than 20 identified binding partners, K2 may
very well connect to multiple signaling and cytoskeletal nodes. Accordingly, the hypothesis that K2's functions
may be subdivided as being integrin-dependent and integrin-independent will be critically assessed. In Aim 1,
this proposition will be tested by expressing either wild-type or K2Q614W615/AA (K2QW/AA) mutant, which
disables its high affinity binding to integrin β subunits, and assessing specific functional responses in the three
major categories of blood vessel cells. In Aim 2, the role of K2 in EC, SMC and PC will be evaluated in vivo
using cell-type specific, conditional K2KO. Vascular responses to be assessed are permeability, angiogenesis,
atherosclerosis and wound healing. These studies should clearly resolve the functions of K2 in the vasculature.
In studies relevant to human disease, K2 expression patterns in kidneys of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
(SLE) patients and in coronary blood vessels and will be examined. In Aim 3, structure-function relationships
and mechanisms by which K2 mediates cellular responses will be investigated. These studies include an effort
to precisely locate two integrin-independent functions (actin and catenin binding sites in K2). Surprisingly, our
structural analyses indicate that a second K2 binding site exists in the membrane proximal region (as
distinguished from its well-characterized membrane distal site) in integrin β cytoplasmic tails. The function and
specificity of this site in eliciting K2-dependent signaling across integrins will be investigated, and the existence
and function of a homologous site for kindlin-3 in activation and signaling across αMβ2 will also be determined.
Overall, these studies should establish that K2 is a master regulator of vascular cell biology and define the
mechanisms underlying this role in vivo."

The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand the activation and signaling mechanisms of integrins –
a class of heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that control cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion and
diverse adhesion-dependent physiological and pathological processes such as angiogenesis, blood clotting,
thrombosis, and stroke. Discovered four decades ago, integrins have been intensively studied with nearly 75,000
articles in PubMed. Tremendous effort has been made by many laboratories to investigate the mechanism of
integrin activation – the first key step to initiate the cell-ECM adhesion, which led to the discovery and elucidation
of a key integrin activator talin – a large actin-binding protein containing an N-terminal head domain (talin-H) and
a C-terminal rod domain (Talin-R). It is now widely believed that talin utilizes its talin-H to bind integrin
cytoplasmic face to elicit an “inside-out” conformational signal to activate the receptor. However, a recent pilot
study from our laboratory revealed unexpectedly that a constitutively active full length talin is much more potent
than talin-H to activate integrins, challenging the talin-H-only premise for controlling the integrin activation.
Moreover, intact talin is autoinhibited in the cytosol and how it is recruited/activated to activate integrin and link
integrin to actin (outside-in signaling) for promoting cytoskeleton reassembly and dynamic adhesion remains
elusive. We propose to resolve these puzzling issues in three highly integrated aims. Aim1 will elucidate how a
small GTPase Rap1 cooperatively binds talin F0 and F1 domains of talin-H to facilitate the talin recruitment and
how a nascent adhesion adaptor paxillin synergizes with PIP2 to activate talin. Aim2 will investigate that after
activating talin, how paxillin further regulates the talin function by bridging its talin-H as well as talin-R to another
integrin activator kindlin-2 to promote potent integrin activation. The results would provide novel insight into how
talin R contributes significantly to the integrin activation. Aim3 will examine how talin mediates integrin signaling
to actin cytoskeleton – a long speculated integrin outside-in process that has remained poorly elucidated.
Together, our proposed studies are expected to lead to a new paradigm for understanding the cell adhesion
mechanisms by providing a comprehensive view of how talin is regulated to undergo a sequence of dynamic
events to activate integrin and link it to actin filaments leading to cytoskeleton reassembly and dynamic adhesion.
Given the critical involvement of talin and its associated proteins in thrombosis, stroke, etc., our studies may
ultimately lead to the development of better diagnosis and therapeutics for these diseases."

Decisions in complex environments rely on context-sensitive processes for estimating the subjective value of
available alternatives. A course of action that would be beneficial in one context might be disadvantageous in
another. Context has an especially pronounced impact on how time and delay factor into decisions, with
different levels of patience favored in different environments. Understanding the normative cognitive and neural
mechanisms that support context-appropriate calibration of decision processes is a critical step toward
understanding the seemingly impulsive or dysregulated decisions that occur in mental health conditions.
Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is thought to contribute to integrative, context-sensitive estimates of
subjective value via interactions with brain systems involved in memory, motivation, and time estimation.
However, person-to-person variability in the anatomy and functional topography of vmPFC has limited our
ability to target precise and meaningful cortical subregions in mechanistic studies of its normative role or in
studies of clinical populations. The present project seeks to identify and characterize individual-level cortical
subregions engaged during value-based decisions that require event-specific integration of temporal and
contextual information. The project is a collaboration among investigators with expertise using neuroimaging
and computational methods to study value-based decision making, context representation, and memory. Aim 1
will use a foraging-like experimental paradigm in which the value of engaging with a distinctive item depends
on an episodic assessment of how recently it was previously encountered, with either recent (“fresh”) or non-
recent (“ripe”) items having greater reward value in different contexts. We will use multi-session fMRI with a
vmPFC-optimized acquisition protocol to identify individual-specific cortical regions that show activity
modulated by recency-dependent value irrespective of physical item features or recency per se. We
hypothesize that valuation effects will emerge in vmPFC subregions that are reproducible within-individual and
have a systematic profile of functional connectivity with the medial temporal lobe and other brain structures.
Aim 2 will develop a theoretical computational model of cognitive processes for flexibly translating episodic
temporal information into decision value. We will test and refine the model on the basis of behavioral data and
will test for model-predicted representations in our own fMRI data and other existing data sets. Aim 3 will
examine situations in which patterns of context-dependent value must be disengaged and reinstated on the
basis of feedback in a changing environment, and will use fMRI to examine signals associated with contextual
updating in vmPFC and medial temporal lobes. Results from the project will advance our fundamental
understanding of brain processes that support contextually adaptive decision behavior in complex
environments and will lead to new methods for identifying meaningful cortical analysis targets in future studies
of health conditions characterized by maladaptive patterns of decision making."

 Despite the numerous pharmacological and immunological approaches for multimodal glioma treatments
proposed in recent years, glioma phenotypic and genotypic spatial profiles remain heterogeneous and, therefore,
represent the biggest disadvantage for patient outcomes due to the development of treatment resistance.
 Cell fusions through permanent cell-fusion and temporal tunneling nanotube (TNT) formations are novel,
recently discovered sources of intercellular gene transfers and glioma heterogeneity. In our grant, we will provide
a detailed analysis of cellular mechanisms essential for intercellular gene transfer via cell fusion and TNT
formations for different glioma subtypes in patient-derived tissue, mimicked glioma microenvironment in vitro,
and in mouse glioma models in vivo. Cell fusion and TNT formations in the context of tumor heterogeneity will
be detailed by following techniques: i) the high-resolution spatial cell transcriptional and histological profiling in
tissue slices (Visium platform); ii) the RNA-Seq and WES profiling (Illumina platform) on a single-cell level after
cell-type-specific enrichment by flow cytometry technique from dissociated tissue; iii) the proteomics (HCP, mass
spectrometry) analysis of molecular complexes involved in gene transfer at different stages of cell interaction.
Cell-specific Cas9/gRNA- directed gene knockdown in combination with the target rescue experiments and
quantitative Cre/fluorescence-based reporters of cell fusion and TNT formations will be utilized in vitro and in
vivo to complement RNA-Seq, WES, and proteomics data, allowing identification of new targets and providing
seeds for the development of novel pharmacological inhibitors of cell fusion and TNT formations.
 Our preliminary data identified horizontal gene transfer via cell fusion and TNT formations between
glioma cells themselves and glioma/normal host cells in the hypoxic, inflammatory, mechanically stressed,
cytotoxic, and amino acid deprived microenvironmental glioma loci. We analyzed the transcriptomic and
proteomic signature of five PDGx cell lines of different molecular subtypes and confirmed that a central node of
the cellular stress response, the mRNA-binding protein HuR, is an essential regulator of cell fusion and TNT
formations in numerous stress conditions. The key biomarkers of TNT formations (TNFAIP2, GJA1) and
numerous endogenous fusogenes are direct HuR mRNA targets and overexpressed in gliomas in a HuR-
dependent manner. Therefore, we propose that pharmacological inhibitors of HuR function may serve as
suppressors of intercellular gene transfers evoked by cell fusion and TNT formations. In our grant, the impact of
the recently developed and patented by our group inhibitors of HuR dimerization (SRI42127 is a lead compound)
will be assessed in the regulation of glioma heterogeneity in vitro and in vivo. The high throughput genome-wide
in vivo screening of PDGx cell lines transduced with a Human GeCKOv2 CRISPR genome-wide knockout library
will be employed to reveal and compensate potential mechanisms of cell fusion tolerance to the HuR inhibitors."

Chronic autoimmune uveitis is often a treatment-resistant disease, leading to irreversible vision loss in a
significant number of patients, particularly in the working-age population, and thus adds a substantial socio-
economic burden due to consequent healthcare costs and productivity loss. The preponderance of previous
studies investigating autoimmune uveitis have focused on the acute stage of the disease using the popular
murine models of acute uveitis, which in fact uncommonly leads to severe vision loss in humans in contrast
to chronic uveitis. Thus, there is a major deficiency in our current understanding of the precise pathogenic
mechanisms in chronic uveitis. Our laboratory has recently developed and validated a mouse model of
chronic autoimmune uveitis (CAU) in wild-type animals, which replicates the clinical features of chronic
sight-threatening uveitis observed in humans. Using this unique CAU model, we have demonstrated distinct
long-lived memory CD4+ T cells in chronic disease, in contrast to the short-lived effector CD4+ T cells in
acute disease. These memory T cells are antigen-specific, autoreactive effectors (`effector-memory' T cells)
responsible for the chronic persistence of intraocular inflammation in CAU. Furthermore, our preliminary
work reveals a local hypoxic microenvironment within the inflamed retina in CAU, which is associated with
prominent up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), glycolytic metabolism, and Wnt/β-catenin
transcriptional activity selectively in the retinal infiltrating memory T cells but not in other retinal cells. We
thus hypothesize that HIF-1α promotes chronic autoimmune uveitis via maintaining the pathogenic memory
CD4+ T cell pool through regulating metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming of T cells that facilitates
their function and long-term survival. The principal objectives of this project are to (i) determine individual
contribution of HIF-1α, glycolysis, and Wnt/β-catenin activation to uveitogenicity of memory CD4+ T cells;
and further (ii) determine whether HIF-1α modulates memory CD4+ T cells and chronic uveitis through
activating glycolytic metabolism and Wnt/β-catenin transcriptional pathway. To achieve these objectives,
three specific aims have been developed: Aim 1: Is HIF-1α expression by memory T cells required for their
function and long-term survival and maintaining disease chronicity? Aim 2: Is enhanced glycolysis in
memory T cells required for their pathogenic function and driven by HIF-1α? And Aim 3: Is activated Wnt/β-
catenin transcriptional pathway in memory T cells required for their longevity and driven by HIF-1α?
Successful completion of this project will substantially advance our knowledge of molecular mechanisms in
modulating pathobiology of uveitogenic memory T cells and provide potentially novel therapeutic
approaches precisely targeting the underlying cause of chronic autoimmune uveitis."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is an aggressive malignancy that remains largely incurable. The KRAS
oncogene is mutated in 95% of PDAs and acts as a potent driver of PDA growth and maintenance. Oncogenic
KRAS induces a profound rewiring of metabolic pathways that are essential for PDA growth. Interestingly, this
rewiring generates metabolic by-products, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), that can potentially oxidize
macromolecules, resulting in genomic instability and toxic cellular damage. However, in addition to these
indiscriminate activities, ROS can also initiate redox signaling through oxidative post-translational modifications
of proteinaceous cysteines, such that toggling between the reduced and oxidized states of cysteine constitutes
a “redox switch” that can regulate the structure and/or function of a protein. Indeed, using our pancreatic
organoid model (Cell, 2015), we previously showed that oncogenic KRAS promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis in
part by regulating the cyclic reduction/oxidation of cysteines on select proteins involved in the translation
machinery (Cell, 2016), thereby promoting protein synthesis (Cell, 2016), glucose metabolism, and tumor growth
(Nature Communications, 2019). While cysteine is well-recognized for its susceptibility to oxidation, it is often
not appreciated that methionine, the other sulfur-containing amino acid, can be readily oxidized to methionine
sulfoxide, and reduced by the oxidoreductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA). Using a tissue
microarray of patient-derived pancreatic tumors and adjacent normal tissues, we observed a stage-dependent
decrease in MSRA protein expression in tumor tissues. Consistently, acute knockout of murine MSRA using
CRISPR/Cas9 in premalignant pancreatic organoids provides a migratory advantage in vitro and in vivo. Thus,
we hypothesize that redox signaling through oxidative post-translational modification of methionine
residues (Met-oxPTM) represents an unexplored mechanism that supports pancreatic metastasis.
Herein, we propose to i) define the mechanism regulating MSRA expression in PDA, ii) characterize the
functional and clinical significance of oxidized methionine peptides in PDA metastasis, and iii) define and
characterize targetable vulnerabilities created by Met-oxPTM in PDA cells."

 Non-Hispanic Black women (NHBW) are twice as likely as NH White women to suffer SMM, which in-
creases risk for maternal mortality. Although the clinical cause of SMM is multifactorial, the disparity is driven
by structural racism. Despite the breadth of knowledge and existing preventive strategies, prolonged SMM dis-
parities suggest that current efforts alone are insufficient to achieve equity. Thus, alternate approaches are
needed to transform understanding of the causes of SMM disparities and to generate breakthroughs in preven-
tion. We argue that SMM disparities are best conceptualized as dynamically complex systems, consisting of
tightly coupled elements that continually evolve over time. Thus, to address SMM disparities among NHBW,
we will apply complex systems approaches – namely, system dynamics (SD) modeling and system dynamics
group model building (SD GMB) – to answer complexity-informed research questions and enable more effica-
cious prevention strategies.
 The overall aim of this project is to apply complex systems approaches to generate a holistic under-
standing of the dynamically complex systems underlying SMM outcomes among NHBW, and then
translate this understanding into a novel, evidence-based simulation model to be used for evaluating
the effectiveness of interventions that can curb SMM outcomes among NHBW. Our specific aims are as
follows: 1) to use SD GMB to create a qualitative SD model of the dynamically complex systems that generate
SMM outcomes among NHBW; 2) to translate the qualitative SD model into a quantitative SD simulation
model; 3) to identify, evaluate, and enhance the effectiveness of existing and plausible interventions that can
reduce disparate SMM outcomes among NHBW; and 4) to disseminate the quantitative SD model as a simula-
tion-based dashboard for stakeholders and researchers aiming to reduce SMM outcomes among NHBW.
 The successful completion of this project is expected to transform understanding of the development and
perpetuation of SMM disparities by: a) using systems science methods to identify effective solutions to re-
duce racial gaps in health; b) disseminating insights to diverse stakeholders to guide broader community-
level healthcare and social policy decision-making in the presence of dynamic complexity; and c) providing
an initial SD model of maternal health disparities that can spur replication across other contexts. This project
will also impact health disparities research more broadly by: a) demonstrating the potential of convening di-
verse perspectives in maternal health, complex systems science, and participatory research methods in
health disparities research; b) providing transformative evidence of the utility of complex systems approaches
in maternal health disparities research and prevention; and c) generating the first SD model of SMM dispari-
ties that can be expanded or adapted to other contexts (e.g. as a national model), with anticipated and plau-
sible impacts for the broader public and population health fields and related disciplines."

The brain transforms experiences into patterns of activity that control emotions, decisions and
behaviors. Discriminating these patterns of activity allow these experiences to be stored as
distinct entities, separating important stimuli from unimportant ones, and catalogued into
memory. Modern techniques in neuroscience such as large-scale recording, computational tools
for analysis of these datasets and circuit-based manipulations provide an opportunity for
developing a deeper understanding the mechanisms of learning and discrimination. These
efforts are of profound importance to human health, as the inability to encode experiences
appropriate precision is a hallmark of cognitive disorders associated with aging. One way that
neural circuits may discriminate experiences is by, at the population level, separating the neural
representations of these experiences with learning, allowing a readout area to better decode the
stimulus from the patterns of activity. A locus of this computation is the hippocampus (HPC),
which, with learning, encodes the relationships and distinctions between behaviorally relevant
variables. We have recently found the dentate gyrus subregion of the hippocampus classifies
cortical representations of olfactory stimuli, increasing the distance between odor
representations with learning. In this proposal, we aim to understand the mechanism by which
stimulus representations in the DG change with learning. In Aim 1, we will use viral,
electrophysiological and imaging tools to map the cell-types and networks that generate odor
representations in the DG. In Aim 2 we will determine the local circuit mechanisms that control
the flexibility of odor representations with learning, with a focus on dopamine-dependent
modulation of encoding dynamics in DG GCs. In Aim 3, we will determine how aging impacts
the flexibility neural representations in the DG, and how circuit-based manipulations can reverse
neural discrimination deficits in aged mice. Understanding the mechanisms that support
learning-induced flexibility of neural ensembles will facilitate the development of therapeutics for
the treatment of age-related cognitive decline."

 This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Brett Einerson, a Maternal-Fetal Medicine (MFM) physician at
the University of Utah. Dr. Einerson is a promising young investigator in placenta accreta spectrum (PAS)
research. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator and national leader of PAS
studies that evaluate treatments for PAS, including in situ conservative management (CM). This K23 award will
provide Dr. Einerson with the protected time and mentored support to accomplish the following career goals: 1]
develop expertise in clinical trial design and management; 2] acquire proficiency in interview study design and
qualitative assessment; 3] obtain advanced skills in health economic evaluation; and 4] develop and strengthen
research leadership and management skills. To achieve these goals, Dr. Einerson assembled a mentoring
team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Robert Silver, a MFM physician and international leader in PAS
research, and two co-mentors: Dr. Erin Rothwell, a NIH-funded scientist and expert in shared decision-making,
qualitative research, and research ethics, and Dr. Richard Nelson, a federally-funded health economist. Dr.
Einerson also has four advisors with expertise in clinical trials, CM, and multicenter research leadership.
 PAS is an extremely morbid and increasingly common pregnancy condition that often results in massive
obstetric hemorrhage. The standard treatment in the US is hysterectomy, but this treatment is complex,
morbid, and costly. A promising alternative for PAS treatment is CM, a strategy in which the placenta is left in
the uterus. Unfortunately, there are insufficient data available to compare outcomes of these two treatments
because past studies are limited by non-randomized study designs, minimal inclusion of patient values in
making treatment decisions, and nominal consideration of economic barriers to care. A large clinical trial
comparing PAS treatments is needed. Dr. Einerson's research will provide essential data to prepare for a
randomized clinical trial and will provide the evidence base for enhanced shared decision-making regarding
treatments for PAS. He will (Aim 1) evaluate the feasibility of randomizing patients to CM for PAS; (Aim 2)
identify the information needs, outcome priorities, and shared decision-making preferences for PAS; and (Aim
3) quantify the cost of PAS treatments. In Aim 1, Dr. Einerson will design and implement a pilot trial of PAS
patients randomized to CM or hysterectomy to evaluate feasibility of a larger trial. In Aim 2, Dr. Einerson will
conduct interviews with patients, clinicians, and partners to assess the information needs and values of those
who are part of making treatment decisions for PAS. In Aim 3, Dr. Einerson will compare the cost of PAS
treatments using advanced economic analytics.
 The expected outcome will lay the groundwork for a large clinical trial of CM versus hysterectomy for PAS
and help to establish the data necessary for shared decision-making and value-based care in PAS. Completing
these goals and aims will prepare Dr. Einerson for a successful transition into an independent clinical trialist."

The axon initial segment (AIS) is a critical mediator of neuronal function, and changes in its structure or
location have been implicated in several neurodegenerative conditions. In diseases such as diabetes and
Alzheimer's disease, there is a shortening of the AIS with cognitive impairment. Dementia and mild cognitive
impairment are well recognized comorbidities of type 2 diabetes, termed diabetic encephalopathy, that lack in
course modifying treatment options. AIS shortening may be reversible, hence investigating the mechanism
responsible could address this significant gap in patient care by providing new therapeutic targets. The overall
goal of this proposal is to examine the cellular mechanisms responsible for AIS shortening in these patients
while providing the training necessary to support the career development of the applicant. Endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, a cellular condition that activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been
implicated in diabetic encephalopathy. Preliminary studies show induction of ER stress induces AIS shortening,
and inhibition of ER stress prevents AIS shortening in vitro. This NRSA F30 proposal will test the hypothesis
that endoplasmic reticulum stress modulates the axon initial segment leading to cognitive impairment in type 2
diabetes utilizing two aims. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the UPR PERK pathway underlies ER stress-
induced AIS shortening. The PERK pathway of the UPR activates calcineurin, a phosphatase associated with
AIS shortening. This aim will pharmacologically and genetically inhibit PERK in mouse cortical neuron culture
and evaluate changes in AIS structure and neuronal network activity following ER stress induction. Aim 2 will
test the hypothesis that ER stress inhibition ameliorates AIS shortening and cognitive impairment in diabetes.
This aim will inhibit ER stress in db/db mice, an established model of type 2 diabetes, and evaluate changes in
cognitive performance and AIS structure. Confirmation of the central hypothesis in the proposed study will
identify ER stress and AIS shortening as therapeutic targets to mitigate cognitive impairment in diabetic
encephalopathy. Completion of this proposal will also provide opportunities for training key to the applicant's
future research goal to be an independent physician scientist studying changes in neural transmission and
cognitive defects caused by neurodegenerative diseases. This proposal is significant because completion will
elucidate a target for therapeutic research to treat this condition in patients with type 2 diabetes while training a
future physician scientist who will care for them."
10904982,"Dysregulation of lipid metabolism is strongly associated with age-dependent retinal
diseases including age-related macular degeneration (AMD) based on genetic and
epidemiological studies. However, the roles of dysregulated lipid metabolism in the development
and progression of age-dependent retinal diseases remain largely unknown. Mouse models
showing impairment of lipid metabolism and cellular homeostasis in the retina provide excellent
tools to study how dysregulated lipid metabolism impacts retinal health and lead to age-
dependent retinal diseases. We identified one such mouse strain harboring a mutation in
transmembrane protein 135 (Tmem135) that displays signs of accelerated aging in the retina as
well as pathologies observed in AMD including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell
abnormalities, inflammation and photoreceptor cell degeneration. We found that mitochondrial
dynamics are dysregulated in Tmem135 mutant mice. In the previous funding period, we further
identified the role of TMEM135 in lipid metabolism in the retina. Our lipidomics data showed
reduced DHA levels in Tmem135 mice and indicated that TMEM135 has a role in DHA export
from peroxisomes. We also found that TMEM135 is critical for the regulation of peroxisomal
number and lipid metabolism in the retina. The number of peroxisomes is correlated with
mitochondrial morphology and function in Tmem135 mutant mice and mice overexpressing
Tmem135 (Tmgm135 TG), suggesting close interaction between these organelles. Moreover,
the Tmem135 mutation changes expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism in mouse
eyecups, which are similar to genes differentially expressed in RPE/choroid of AMD patients.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that “Regulation of peroxisomal functions through
TMEM135 is essential to maintaining the normal function and integrity of RPE and
photoreceptor cells, dysregulation of which leads to age-dependent retinal disease phenotypes.”
In this renewal proposal, we will investigate how TMEM135 regulates lipid metabolism,
mitochondrial function and retinal function through its role in peroxisomes and DHA synthesis.
Specifically, we will 1) test the hypothesis that decreased DHA levels in Tmem135 mutant mice
are responsible for the retinal abnormalities, 2) determine the contributions of fatty acid
synthesis pathways on Tmem135 mutant retinal pathologies, and 3) test the role of peroxisomes
in mitochondrial homeostasis in the RPE. Successful completion of this project will reveal the
previously unknown role of Tmem135 in age-dependent changes of retinal cells, and identify
factors involved in those processes, which may lead to novel supplementation or treatment
options for aging and age-related diseases in the retina."
10829460,"The goals of this project are to determine how oxidative DNA damage regulates the homology-directed repair
(HDR) pathways that enable telomere maintenance by the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)
mechanisms. Dysfunctional redox regulation is common among cancers and elevates reactive oxygen
species, which generate DNA lesions. Telomeres are highly susceptible to oxidative damage but are essential
for genome stability and sustained cell proliferation. Dysfunctional telomeres arrest cell division or drive excess
chromosomal instability in pre-malignant cells that can cause cell death. To survive and achieve unlimited
proliferation, cancer cells elongate and stabilize telomeres by activating telomerase or ALT. Although less
common, ALT-driven cancers are highly aggressive with poor prognosis. Telomeric single-stranded overhangs
are substrates for both telomerase and ALT-mediated telomere elongation but can self-fold into stable
secondary structures. Previously, we found that low 8oxoG levels stimulate telomerase by altering structure
and overhang accessibility, but that excess 8oxoG damage impairs telomere replication. In this project we will
test the hypothesis that 8oxoG formation and processing at telomeres modulate ALT by promoting replication
fork stalling and altering telomere structures. Using an innovative targeting tool to selectively induce 8oxoG at
telomeres, we obtained preliminary data that 8oxoG increases numerous ALT hallmarks including C-circles,
ALT-associated PML bodies, and telomeric sister chromatid exchanges and mitotic DNA synthesis. Aim 1 will
determine how oxidative base damage modulates ALT and HDR activity in human cancer cell lines, proficient
and deficient for repair. We will induce telomere specific damage or general oxidative stress in ALT and
telomerase positive cells, and will measure cell survival, ALT phenotypes, and various telomere parameters.
ALT requires RAD51 or RAD52 and is regulated by a variety of telomeric structures. Aim 2 will examine how
oxidative lesions modulate telomeric RNA (TERRA) invasion and R-loop formation into telomeres. Using a
single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer detection system, we discovered 8oxoG in telomeric
duplex facilitates TERRA association. We will use complementary cellular studies to examine TERRA
recruitment to telomeres after oxidative damage. Aim 3 will examine how oxidative damage in the telomere
overhang modulates D-loop formation by RAD51-mediated strand invasion, or RAD52-mediated strand
annealing, by using complementary single molecule and biochemical experiments. We will conduct cellular
studies to determine how RAD51 or RAD52 deficiency influence 8oxoG-induced ALT phenotypes. This project
will fill a significant void in our understanding of how general oxidative stress and 8oxoG, in particular, alter
telomere restoration by homology-directed repair and ALT. Ultimately, this knowledge will be highly valuable
for developing new strategies that 1) preserve telomeres to mitigate the effects of oxidative stress on healthy
cells or conversely, that 2) inhibit telomere repair in malignant ALT tumors to halt proliferation."

Glutathione (GSH) is a small thiol antioxidant that is critical in maintaining redox homeostasis, and increases in
glutathione occur in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. Glutathione can also lead to S-glutathionylation
(PSSG), the conjugation of GSH to reactive cysteines in proteins, which can be reversed by the de-
glutathionylase, glutaredoxin (GLRX). While the glutaredoxin/PSSG system has emerged as a key regulator of
redox signaling, little is known about its disruption in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We have made the exciting
discovery that GLRX expression is decreased in human LUAD and that KrasG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis is
enhanced in mice lacking Glrx. In a redox proteomics screen we revealed increases in S-glutathionylation of
ovarian tumor deubiquitinase, OTUB1, which was recently identified as a regulator of System XC-. System XC- is
a cystine/glutamate antiporter that exports glutamate and imports cystine, which is in turn reduced intracellularly
to cysteine, the rate limiting amino acid in glutathione synthesis. System XC- is composed of SLC7A11 and
SLC3A2. OTUB1 binds to SLC7A11 to prevent its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We have made
the exciting discovery that S-glutathionylation of OTUB1 is important in the stabilization of SLC7A11, leading to
increases in GSH. Compared to adjacent control tissue, expression of OTUB1 and SLC7A11 are increased in
LUAD. These exciting findings led us to hypothesize that decreases in glutaredoxin expression in mutant
KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinoma cause increases in system XC- activity through the S-
glutathionylation of ovarian tumor deubiquitinase 1 (OTUB1), augmenting glutathione and promoting
survival of lung cancer cells. Furthermore, we hypothesize that avenues to augment glutaredoxin will diminish
GSH levels leading to increased potency of cisplatin-induced killing of lung cancer cells. In Specific Aim 1 we
will determine whether GLRX status controls KrasG12D-induced tumorigenesis. Specific Aim 2 proposes to
address the importance of OTUB1 S-glutathionylation and System XC- in the augmentation of GSH in KrasG12D-
induced tumors while in Specific Aim 3 we aim to address the impact of AAV-mediated transduction of GLRX on
cisplatin-induced tumor killing in primary LUAD tumor organoids and KrasG12D-driven tumors in mice. Completion
of this proposal will provide new insights into the role of the GLRX-protein S-glutathionylation redox system in
the pathogenesis of LUAD and offers a rationale for augmenting GLRX in lung tumors in order to promote killing.
The pharmaceutical development of GLRX has the potential to offer new therapeutic strategies to combat LUAD,
in combination with standard of care therapy."

Genomics"" is designed for a broad audience of clinicians seeking a strong foundation in genomics, and will be
structured to facilitate collaboration and crosstalk across disciplines. It builds upon the currently funded
program developed at Children's Mercy Hospital (CMH) that uses a multimodal educational approach including
Personal Genome Education Testing (PGET) to engage participants in genomics and precision medicine. The
central goal of the proposed course is to facilitate the implementation of genomic medicine into all aspects of
clinical practice. We will accomplish this goal through the following specific aims: 1) create a flexible teaching
model to optimize genomic education through a combination of well-designed e-learning modules, lectures,
case-based discussions, and hands on workshops, 2) educate course participants on special ethical, legal, and
social implications (ELSI) of genomic testing, 3) to promote the integration of clinical genomic research into
traditional clinical practice. Short and long-term impacts for purposes of curriculum modification and impact will
be collected, with results distributed through scholarly activities (presentations and publications). The
proposed course will enable The Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine (CPGM) to share our translational
genomic expertise with 250 clinicians, committed to the integration of genomic guided precision medicine into
clinical practice, over 5 years."

Ferroptosis is a non-apoptotic cell death process that can suppress tumor formation and
contribute to disease pathology. The long-term objective of this research is to understand the
molecular regulation of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is thought to occur through a stereotypical and
invariant lipid-dependent mechanism. However, in new preliminary studies we have uncovered
evidence for two different forms of ferroptosis defined by unique genetic regulation and metabolic
alterations. We find that ferroptosis triggered by direct inactivation of the enzyme GPX4 requires
the function of the lipid metabolic enzyme ACSL4. A second sub-type of ferroptosis, triggered by
cystine deprivation, does not require ACSL4 or related lipid metabolic enzymes and instead relies
on a novel set of genes. Guided by these new preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that
ferroptosis can be executed by two fundamentally distinct mechanisms. We will test this
hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: (i) defining the role of ACSL4 and related lipid
metabolic enzymes in promoting ferroptosis in response to direct GPX4 inhibition, (ii) identifying
cellular and molecular features that distinguish the two ferroptosis mechanisms in vitro and in
vivo, and (iii) defining genes and processes that regulate ACSL4-independent ferroptosis in
response to cystine deprivation. These studies will be carried out using cutting-edge chemical,
genetic, functional genomic, lipidomic, and imaging tools and methods. This research will advance
our fundamental understanding of ferroptosis, with the ultimate goal of improving human health."

Skeletal muscle wasting/cachexia is a devastating complication of a number of chronic disease
states, such as cancer and in the elderly population. Muscle wasting involves an imbalance in
the rates of protein synthesis and degradation, functional denervation, metabolic abnormalities,
and loss of mitochondrial content and function. TWEAK is a proinflammatory cytokine that binds
to cell surface receptor Fn14 to activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways. We have
found that the expression of Fn14 is increased in skeletal muscle of mouse models of cancer
cachexia and in aged mice. Skeletal muscle-specific ablation of Fn14 inhibits muscle wasting in
a murine model of cancer cachexia. TWEAK represses the rate of protein synthesis in skeletal
muscle both in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, the TWEAK-Fn14 system regulates ER stress-
induced unfolded protein response (UPR) in skeletal muscle of tumor-bearing mice. In addition,
our experiments demonstrate that targeted inhibition of the PERK and/or IRE1/XBP1 arms of
the UPR improves protein synthesis in skeletal muscle of mice. However, the role of the
TWEAK-Fn14 system and UPR pathways in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function
during cancer cachexia and aging remains completely unknown. In this project, we will
investigate the role of TWEAK/Fn14/UPR signaling axis in skeletal muscle atrophy and whether
targeted genetic ablation of Fn14 or components of the UPR attenuate muscle wasting in
preclinical mouse models of cancer cachexia and during aging. Based on our preliminary
results, we hypothesize that the TWEAK/Fn14 system causes skeletal muscle wasting through
the activation of the PERK and the IRE1α/XBP1 arms of the UPR during aging and cancer
cachexia. Our specific aims are to: (I) Investigate the role of the TWEAK/Fn14 system in
skeletal muscle wasting during aging and cancer cachexia, and (II) Investigate the mechanisms
by which TWEAK/Fn14-induced activation of the UPR pathways cause skeletal muscle wasting
during aging and cancer cachexia. Our proposed studies will identify key mechanisms
responsible for the loss of skeletal muscle mass. Successful completion of this project will
provide strong basis for the development of new therapies for sarcopenia and cancer cachexia."

10824352,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death for those
age 65 and older. Costs of care for individuals with AD are substantial: total payments in 2022 are estimated at
$321 billion, and costs will increase by $1 billion each year. AD risk factors include age, sex, and genetics. Of
Americans living with AD, 4 million are women and 2.5 million are men, and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) -e4
allele is the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. In addition, female APOE-e4 carriers are more
likely to progress from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, have more brain atrophy and memory loss, and
develop AD more frequently than age matched males. Hallmark features of AD include the buildup of amyloid
beta (Aβ) and abnormal phosphorylation of Tau, resulting in plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain.
Importantly in AD, disruptions to extracellular vesicle (EV) biogenesis result in altered EV miRNA and protein
cargo, and neuronal EVs in AD contain and propagate both Aβ and Tau. Our previous studies identified
miRNAs in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from living donors that discriminate AD patients from healthy
control (CTL) participants, and we found that combining CSF miRNAs plus CSF Aβ42:total Tau measurements
improves classification of AD and MCI vs. CTL. In the studies proposed herein, we focus on the utility of CSF
EVs and their cargo as more robust biomarkers for AD, that show distinct differences in females vs. males and
those with the APOE-e4 vs. APOE-e3 genotype. Our pilot data in human CSF EVs and postmortem brain
shows that: i) the size of membranous particles is larger in AD vs. CTL CSF; ii) CSF EVs have surface marker
proteins that are unique to AD and/or Parkinson's disease (PD) vs. CTL; iii) CSF EV miRNAs have improved
predictive power for AD vs. total CSF; iv) CSF EV miRNAs show sex and APOE dependent changes in
expression; v) there is increased miR-16-5p in female AD CSF EVs vs. CTL; and vi) a predicted gene target of
miR-16-5p, SNAP-25, is decreased in female AD hippocampus. Together, these studies support that sex and
APOE-e4 both contribute to changes in AD CSF EVs, which may account in part for the higher prevalence of
AD in females, and the increased risk for AD in people with the APOE-e4 genotype. Thus, we propose to
establish the physical features and molecular cargo of AD CSF EVs vs. CTL, within the context of sex and
APOE genotype. We will use our Information Theory method to identify the strongest dependencies that can
distinguish AD from PD from CTL, and to identify candidate biomarkers for high-risk AD. We include male and
female PD to identify CSF EV surface markers and cargo that are unique from AD. We will then identify and
verify gene targets of CSF EV miRNAs that are relevant to AD. Together, our studies will establish specific
biomarkers for AD by combining the physical features, surface marker profiles, miRNAs, and proteins in CSF
EVs. They will also establish the neurologically relevant gene targets of AD EV miRNAs in human brain, which
may contribute to the processes underlying AD pathogenesis and serve as novel therapeutic targets for AD."

Compassionate and effective pain management after surgery represents a foundation of humane medical care.
Opioids still present the mainstay of post-surgical pain therapy: more than 80% of patients are prescribed opioids
for use following surgery. During one year in the U.S., more than 17% of Americans fill at least one opioid
prescription, and, per prescription, the average daily amount exceeded 45 milligram morphine equivalents. In
addition to common side effects, serious risks of opioids include addiction, abuse, and overdose. Prescription
overdose deaths contribute to more than one-third of all opioid overdose deaths and remain five-fold higher than
in 1999. Over-prescription of opioids remains extremely common, with up to 90% of patients after common
surgical procedures reporting leftover opioids. Unused opioids are stored in unsecured locations in 75% of cases
and can create a reservoir that fuels the ongoing opioid epidemic. Most large-scale efforts, such as the CDC
guidelines for prescribing opioids, have focused on chronic opioid use. There is an urgent need to increase
access to high-quality, safe, and scalable interventions to reduce our reliance on opioids for effective post-
surgical pain management at discharge. A diverse team with expertise in pain medicine, perioperative outcomes,
clinical trials, biostatistics, and health economics has been assembled to conduct the Efficiency And Quality In
Post-Surgical Pain Therapy After Discharge “EQUIPPED” study. Our central hypothesis is that pain therapy after
surgery can and should be prescribed in a safer, patient-centered fashion, as opposed to current “one-size-fits-
all” methods. To test this hypothesis, three aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1 will test a provider-facing EHR-
based decision support tool that suggests outpatient opioid prescriptions based on inpatient opioid requirements.
This aim will utilize a pragmatic randomized cluster multiple crossover controlled trial design in about 39,000
patients in four hospitals. Specific Aim 2 will test a patient-facing health informatics app that encourages non-
opioid pain management strategies. This aim employs a randomized controlled trial design in 600 surgical
patients. Two separate clinical trials are proposed because of different outcomes (amount of opioids prescribed
vs. opioids used) and scopes of implementation (multisite vs. single site). The provider-facing tool will be
incorporated into the trial of the patient-facing app using a 2x2 design that facilitates a detailed evaluation of the
individual effects of these interventions, as well as any interactions when using the interventions together. Finally,
Specific Aim 3 will include a cost-effectiveness analysis and compare the individual and combined cost-
effectiveness of a provider-facing and a patient-facing intervention. Completion of this project will demonstrate
that the amounts of opioids prescribed and opioids taken after discharge following surgery can be reduced while
ensuring effective treatment of pain. Increasing access to safe, affordable, and high-quality pain therapy for
surgical patients will drive the positive impact of this application, which directly addresses Special Emphasis

10893370,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The opioid use disorder (OUD) crisis in the US is an epidemic of poor access to care, including medication
assisted treatment (MAT) and evidence-based behavioral interventions to support MAT outcomes. Low-
income, racial/ethnic minority individuals with OUD disproportionately evidence poor MAT outcomes, including
less than half of individuals typically being retained in MAT at six months. Retention is one of the factors most
predictive of future relapse, functioning, and mortality. Implementing evidence-based interventions to improve
MAT retention that are particularly appropriate for the needs of low-income, racial/ethnic minority individuals
with OUD is essential. Peer recovery coaches (PRCs), trained individuals with their own lived experience with
substance use disorder, may be uniquely suited to address common barriers to MAT retention among
underserved populations, including stigma, challenges navigating services, housing instability, other structural
and psychosocial factors. PRC-delivered interventions are a promising strategy for improving MAT retention for
low-income, minority individuals with OUD, yet there are few evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that have
been evaluated for PRC delivery to promote MAT retention. Preliminary work by our team suggests that
behavioral activation (BA) may be a feasible, scalable reinforcement-based approach for improving MAT
retention for low-income, minority individuals with OUD by PRCs. The proposed study builds upon our team’s
formative work to adapt and evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of a PRC-delivered BA intervention
(Peer Activate) to support MAT retention for low-income, minority individuals initiating MAT in Baltimore City,
which has one of the highest overdose-fatality rates in the US and greatest burdens of OUD among low-
income, racial/ethnic minority individuals. In Phase 1, we propose to refine and finalize the PRC-delivered Peer
Activate model and address barriers to implementation for Phase 2 using pre-intervention focus groups with
PRCs, staff, clients, and other key stakeholders (n=24). We will establish the preliminary feasibility,
acceptability and fidelity of Peer Activate in an open-label trial (n=30) and pilot Phase 2 study procedures,
including collecting preliminary MAT outcomes (MAT retention and opioid abstinence at 3 months). Based
upon adaptations in Phase 1, we will then conduct a randomized, Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation
trial to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of Peer Activate vs. treatment as usual (TAU; n=200) on
MAT retention at six months (primary), MAT adherence and opioid abstinence (urine toxicology), and
depressive symptoms (secondary). Implementation outcomes will be assessed at multiple levels (patient,
provider, organization), including assessments of feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and adoption guided by
Proctor’s conceptual model of implementation outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team aims to develop an
evidence-based PRC-delivered treatment model that can be sustainably delivered to improve MAT retention
for low-income, minority individuals with OUD."

Streptococcus sanguinis is a commensal oral bacterium and a pioneer colonizer
of human teeth. It is associated with infective endocarditis and can enter the
bloodstream through oral lesions, invasive dental procedures or routine oral
activities such as chewing, flossing and brushing teeth. Recent developments in
genomic technologies have created an opportunity to study streptococcal fitness
genes as a whole by systems biology. This application proposes in Aim 1 to identify
genes required for S. sanguinis fitness in an infective endocarditis model by
screening a unique, comprehensive library of S. sanguinis genome-wide mutants.
In Aim 2, a comparable analysis will be performed in saliva, serum and blood using
ORF-seq analysis to clarify the findings of Aim 1 and to identify genes required for
fitness, but not growth in saliva. The fitness genes in saliva and blood will be
compared. Fitness genes that are located at critical hubs will be identified in
network analysis and those that are conserved among oral streptococci will be
identified by bioinformatics. In aim 3, the gene regulation of fitness genes will be
studied in depth. This systematic analysis will provide an unprecedented

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven malignancy that is endemic to East and
Southeast Asia. The overall 5-year survival rate for endemic NPC is only 51%, which represents an unmet clinical
need. While NPC tumors are known to be infected with EBV and express PD-L1, little is known about the role of
EBV-specific T cells in the control of NPC and anti-PD-1 therapy has shown a low rate of efficacy (ORR ~20%).
The goal of this study is to better understand the role of EBV-specific T cell responses in NPC immunopathology
and immunotherapeutic response. We will test the specific hypotheses that: 1. EBV-specific T cells contribute to
tumor control elicited by combination anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, and 2.
that the phenotypic and clonal characteristics/dynamics of peripheral EBV-specific T cells can be useful as
indicators of clinical outcomes for NPC patients. To test these hypotheses, we will leverage our access to two
Singaporean NPC patient cohorts: Cohort 1. A 51-patient cohort of new-diagnosis NPC for which viably frozen
PBMCs and archival FFPE tissues are available and Cohort 2. A 50-patient cohort participating in a phase II
trial (NCT03097939 - National Cancer Centre Singapore) testing the combination of Ipilumimab and
Nivolumimab (Ipi.+Nivo.) immunotherapy with longitudinally collected PBMCs and tissue biopsies. Recently
published preliminary analysis (AACR 2020) from this clinical trial shows that combined Ipi.+Nivo. therapy is safe
and achieved durable responses in recurrent and metastatic NPC patients and identified a negative association
between circulating EBV-DNA levels and response. In addition, preliminary analysis of new-diagnosis NPC
patient peripheral blood samples from Cohort 1 show associations between certain phenotypic profiles of CD8+
T cells and clinical parameters such as EBV-DNA levels. Therefore, in Aim 1. we will investigate the clinical
relevance of these preliminarily identified NPC-associated CD8+ T cell phenotypes. In addition to in-depth single
cell transcriptional, functional TCR sequence profiling of these cells, cellular imaging, transcriptional profiling and
bulk TCR sequencing of patient-matched tumor will allow discovery of novel associations between peripheral T
cells and the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 2., we will characterize EBV-specific T cell responses in the NPC
periphery and tumor microenvironment during combination Ipi.+Nivo. immunotherapy treatment to identify novel
associations between the phenotypic profiles of EBV-specific T cells and immunotherapeutic response. In Aim
3., we will investigate T cell clonal dynamics associated with treatment induced changes to the NPC-specific
immune response by comparing the TCR clonal diversity in peripheral blood and tumor biopsy samples from
different stages of treatment. Overall, characterization of EBV-specific T cells phenotypes in the NPC periphery
and the tumor using multiple cutting-edge approaches will not only improve our understanding of the NPC
immune landscape, but also potentially identify clinically relevant EBV-specific T cell phenotypes that could be
tested in future NPC immunotherapy trials."

therapeutic advances due to its complex pathogenesis and genetic heterogeneity. Experimental approaches that
integrate genetics and biology are necessary to further our understanding of this complex disorder. Both common
genetic variants of small effect and rare genetic mutations of severe effect have been implicated in schizophrenia,
with the latter more likely to produce phenotypes that can be measured in vitro.
This proposal describes a 5-year career development program through which I will develop the conceptual
framework and gain the skills necessary to characterize rare, severe mutations in persons with schizophrenia.
My project will be to evaluate, using CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) in iPSCs, genes that share 3 criteria: 1)
each gene harbors a damaging mutation in one or more patients from our studies; 2) each gene is significantly
associated with schizophrenia per criteria of the SCHEMA consortium; and 3) each gene plays a role in chromatin
remodeling or transcriptional regulation.
In Aim 1, I will use CRISPRi to knock down expression of each of these genes in iPSC-derived neurons, then
compare transcriptional signatures before and after loss of gene expression, and to other iPSC models of
schizophrenia. I will also assay for changes in cellular oxidative stress, a cellular phenotype of iPSC models of
schizophrenia.
In Aim 2, I will generate a patient-derived iPSC line for one of the genes from Aim 1, then create an isogenic
iPSC line with the reversion to wild-type of the mutation using CRISPR-mediated homology directed repair.
(Lymphoblast lines of all patients from Aim 1 are available for this purpose.) I will compare patient and revertant
iPSCs with the same assays as in Aim 1, and also for their ability to form mature neurons, their neurite number,
cellular migration defects, transcriptional profiles, and epigenetic effects.
In Aim 3, from my clinic, I will enroll additional patient-parent-parent trios; collect blood for DNA, RNA, and the
establishment of cell lines; organize the collection of longitudinal clinical data; and carry out exome sequencing
and identify damaging variants for my future studies. I have obtained approval of this aim from the UW IRB.

Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) studies in AD have been very successful in identifying genetic
regions contributing to the disease, but almost all have been in Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Most of these
associated genetic regions lie in non-coding, regulatory areas of the genome. That means to understand how
these associated loci influence the risk of getting AD, we must understand the regulatory architecture of the
genome in these associated regions. Recent efforts from our group and others have sought to understand the
genetic underpinning of AD in diverse, admixed populations such as African Americans (AA) and Hispanics (HI).
These studies have shown that different ethnic and racial groups having distinct genetic architectures that can
lead to differing genetic susceptibility. However, while studies like Encode and Gtex have mapped some of the
regulatory architecture of the human genome, they lack information on diverse populations, as these regulatory
mapping studies have also been almost exclusively in NHW, and not necessarily in the actual cell types that are
affected in Alzheimer disease (AD). This proposal will use multiple avenues of investigation to map the regulatory
architecture of the African and Amerindian Genomes, which, together with European, are the
components that contribute to the admixed AA and HI genomes. Once we have this architecture mapped, we
will use it to understand the mechanisms of disease associated with rare variants and associated non-coding
loci identified in AA and HI association studies. To accomplish this, we will use inducible pluripotent stem cells
from AA and HI (Peruvian) AD cases, chosen to maximize either African or Amerindian global ancestries, as well
as brain tissue from AA and HI individuals. With our collaborator Dr. Fulai Jin at Case Western Reserve
University, state of the art Hi-C techniques will be used to map interactions in both the differentiated iPSC lines
(neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia) as well as the frozen brain tissue. We will also use single
nuclei RNAseq and single nuclei ATACseq to evaluate the brains, bulk ATAC and RNAseq for iPSC lines. All
the genomic data will then be complied, along with supporting existing data from European genomes (NHW), to
create the African and Amerindian regulatory maps. We will then take the identified associated haplotypes from
the outside AA and HI GWAS and rare variant studies and “lay” them across our regulatory
landscape to identify the interacting genes and subregions of the haplotypes affecting the risk for AD in these
populations. Next we will use CRISPRa and CRISPRi techniques to verify these interactions. Finally, we will
incorporate all this data with existing data to help identify high quality genetic targets for therapeutic intervention
for AD."
10898758,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We will use Collaborative Cross (CC) mice to define how genetic traits influence innate and/or IgE-mediated
responses of mast cells (MCs) to honeybee venom. In IgE-dependent allergic reactions, crosslinking of MC
high affinity IgE receptors (i.e., FceRI) by the binding of bivalent or multivalent allergen to antigen-specific IgE
activates MCs to secrete three major classes of products: 1) preformed mediators stored in cytoplasmic
granules, 2) newly synthesized lipid-derived mediators, and 3) cytokines, chemokines and growth factors.
These MC products are responsible for many of the signs and symptoms of allergic diseases. MC activation,
with or without the involvement of IgE, is also thought to contribute to the inflammation, tissue damage, and
even fatal shock induced by envenomation. Components of hymenoptera venoms (e.g., honeybee venom),
pharmaceutical agents, and foods are the most common triggers for anaphylaxis in humans. Many people have
been sensitized to hymenoptera venoms and some unfortunate individuals react after exposure to such insect
stings with serious systemic reactions and even fatal anaphylaxis. However, recent experiments in mice and
zebra fish demonstrate that MC-derived proteases can degrade animal venoms and diminish their toxicity. Also,
IgE/FceRI-mediated MC activation can enhance the survival of mice challenged with honeybee venom or a
snake venom, or with S. aureus bacteria. Yet the benefits of “allergic immune responses”, mediated by IgE/MC-
dependent mechanisms, have not been widely recognized. While the exact mechanisms determining whether
the outcomes of hymenoptera envenomation are detrimental or favorable have been elusive, we know that
genetic factors can significantly influence the development, progression, and severity of allergy and
anaphylaxis. We hypothesize that genetic traits, by modulating the strength and/or composition of MC
responses to honeybee venom and/or the Th2-IgE-MC immune axis, can influence the outcomes of
honeybee stings. In this project, we propose to use genetically diverse CC mice to identify genetic modifiers
regulating MC functions in insect venom allergy. In Aim 1, we will screen a panel of CC mice for their
susceptibility to the toxicity of honeybee venom, development and features of venom-specific type 2 immunity,
and induction of MC activation with or without crosslinking of venom-specific IgE/FceRI. We will also perform
quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of the venom-induced phenotypes in CC mice to identify distinct genetic
loci and novel regulators associated with MC-dependent susceptibility vs. resistance to honeybee venom. In
Aim 2, we will confirm, in mouse MCs, important regulators of MC functions that are identified by screening CC
mice using QTL analysis to assess the involvement of these regulators in innate and/or IgE-mediated MC
functions. We think that the identification of genetic modifiers that distinguish beneficial vs. harmful effects of
innate and/or allergic immune responses to honeybee venom will improve the treatment of severe reactions to
insect venom and probably other disorders in which IgE and MCs have a critical role.

10903794,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Epigenetics of the autoantibody response in systemic lupus.
Like “mature” antibody responses to viruses and bacteria, the lupus autoantibody response requires B cell class-
switch DNA recombination (CSR), somatic hypermutation (SHM) and plasma cell differentiation. As we have
shown, epigenetic factors, including histone modifiers (such as Sirt1) and inhibitors (such as butyrate) modulate
B cell expression of AID (gene: AICDA/Aicda) and Blimp-1 (PRDM1/Prdm1), which are critically for CSR/SHM
and plasma cell differentiation, respectively. Towards a better definition of the epigenetic landscape of lupus B
cells, we hypothesize that Tet2, a key epigenetic factor, mediates the lupus autoantibody response, as prompted
the B cell-intrinsic role of Tet2 in CSR/SHM and plasma cell differentiation (our recent findings). We argue that
Tet2 is induced by the stimuli that induce B cell CSR/SHM and plasma cell differentiation, and it is upregulated
in lupus B cells. We also argue that Tet2 boosts transcription of Aicda and Prdm1 through its Fe2+ and a-
ketoglutarate (a-KG)-dependent catalytic activity for DNA demethylation as well as its non-catalytic function, i.e.,
recruiting Ogt (encoded by X-linked OGT/Ogt) to these loci to effect histone glycosylation. Finally, we contend
that B cell Tet2 transduces hormonal, nutritional and metabolic cues into epigenetic changes to modulate
autoantibody responses, as Tet2 transcription could be upregulated by estrogen (E2, our preliminary data) and
vitamin A, and Tet2 is activated by vitamin C, but inhibited by fumarate (a metabolite and a-KG competitor) – as
shown by us, E2 boosts AID expression, which would enhance females’ antibody and autoantibody responses.
 With extensive experience in and commitment to the mechanistic understanding of human and mouse lupus
autoantibody responses, we are uniquely poised to test our hypotheses using molecular B cell biology systems,
cutting-edge epigenetic tools (hydroxylmethyl DNA analysis, bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite conversion, ChIP
and ATAC-Seq), genetically modified mice (TgAicda-creTet2fl/fl, Tet2HxD-mut/HxD-mut and Tet2Ogt-mut/Ogt-mut knockin mice,
TgAicda-creOgtfl/fl, Tet2HxD-mut/HxD-mutTgAicda-creOgtfl/fl, MRL/Lpr TgAicda-creTet2fl/fl, MRL/Lpr Tet2HxD-mut/HxD-mut and MRL/Lpr
TgAicda-creOgtfl/fl), proprietary humanized H-Mice® and Lupus-H-Mice® models. Aim 1 addresses human and
mouse B cell differentiation stage-specific (resting, activated, plasma and memory cell) regulation of Tet2, Tet2
protein stability, E2 upregulation of Tet2 transcripts and underlying mechanisms. Aim 2 addresses the B cell-
intrinsic role of Tet2 in promoting AID and Blimp-1 expression, the underlying mechanisms (active DNA
demethylation and Ogt-mediated histone glycosylation), and potentiation effect of Tet2 inducer vitamin A and
activator vitamin C, and suppressive effect of Tet2 catalytic inhibitor (fumarate, TET-IN-C35 or Bobcat339) alone
or combined with Ogt ablation or Tet2Ogt-mut/Ogt-mut knockin. Aim 3 analyzes dysregulation of Tet2 and Tet2-
mediated epigenetic mechanisms in human and mouse lupus B cells, addresses the role of Tet2 in lupus, and
explores Tet2 inhibitors and Ogt inhibitor ST045849 as lupus therapeutics. Our experiments will unveil novel and
targetable epigenetic mechanisms that integrate environmental cues to inform the lupus autoantibody response."

 2 People with hearing impairment report listening effort as a major barrier to successful social communication
 3 (Hughes et al. 2018), with increases in effort leading to increases in anxiety (Morata et al. 2005), early retirement
 4 (Danermark & Gellerstedt 2004), changes in social behavior and negative self-image (Hétu et al. 1988), and
 5 listening-related fatigue (Edwards, 2007). Fatigued adults have been shown to be less productive in the
 6 workplace, with increases in work absences, more errors and accidents than those not suffering from fatigue
 7 (Ricci et al. 2007; Williamson et al. 2011), and workers with hearing loss taking more sick leave due to complaints
 8 of “mental distress” (Kramer et al., 2006). Therefore, it is critical to understand what aspects of communication
 9 are effortful for listeners with hearing impairment, and the ways that sustained effort leads to accumulated mental
10 fatigue. Previous work has mostly examined listening effort and fatigue separately, with vastly different
11 experimental methods and designs, leaving the mechanistic connection between effort and fatigue unknown.
12 This project is designed to address that need by expanding on previous work to explore whether the same
13 mechanisms that contribute to listening effort are merely episodic, or whether they directly contribute to
14 accumulated fatigue. One of the primary mechanisms of listening effort is mentally repairing misperceived words
15 when perceiving speech; using context to retroactively repair earlier misperceptions is effortful (Winn & Teece
16 2021), yet the same context when used predictively can reduce effort (Winn 2016). The aims of this project are
17 to 1) identify how reliance on cognitive repair to recover misperceptions affects listening effort, and 2) directly
18 measure the impact of sustained effortful listening on accumulated fatigue. The first aim will result in identifying
19 the time-course of effort when repairing early versus later misperceived words. Importantly, these results will
20 show how effort is sustained during language processing, potentially for several seconds after sentence offset.
21 The second aim will explore whether momentary increases in effort accumulate to fatigue, which will be
22 measured physiologically (pupillometry) and behaviorally (reaction time). The long-term goals of this project are
23 to improve our understanding of what makes listening effortful for people with CIs and to understand whether
24 the same mechanisms that contribute to listening effort also contribute to fatigue or are merely episodic increases
25 in effort. These goals directly address the NIDCD’s priority of increasing our knowledge of the mechanisms of
26 the cognitive processes needed for successful communication in more real-world environments. The training
27 program involves extensive instruction in behavioral measures, pupillometry, and advanced statistical analysis
28 relevant to the proposed research. This research will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in
29 hearing and listening effort, at an institution with a strong track record of hearing loss research, a history of
30 training grants, and interdisciplinary collaboration in clinical sensory science."
10813756,"Project Summary/Abstract
 In the United States, millions of people sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) each year carrying individual,
healthcare, and societal costs greater than $45 billion annually. Mild TBI (mTBI) accounts for more than 75% of
all TBIs, with many individuals sustaining more than one. mTBI patients report post-concussion syndrome (PCS)
symptoms that include sleep disorders (insomnia, daytime sleepiness), somatic symptoms (dizziness, headache,
blurred vision), cognitive complaints (memory, executive function), and emotional problems (anxiety, depression,
irritability, disinhibition). For many, PCS is transient, and still 10-25% report persistent PCS symptoms. The
enigmatic PCS symptom presentation and persistence after mTBI urges investigation into dynamic responses
in the brain that tie acute neurophysiology to behavioral function. The investigative team has refined in vivo
imaging methods of miniaturized microscopes (miniscopes) to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood
brain barrier (BBB) permeability in the unrestrained, behaving mouse. New preliminary data leverage the
miniscope headcap to induce impact acceleration (weight drop) closed head injury. The data driving this proposal
show immediate accumulation of fluorescent dextrans in the parenchyma within the field of view. The strength
of this approach eliminates anesthesia during long-duration imaging, permits naturalistic behavior without head
restraint, and locks into a baseplate for repeated imaging of single channel, wide-field, fluorescence. For the first
time, the cumulative effects of TBI on neurophysiology (CBF, BBB permeability, sleep) can be regressed toward
neurobehavioral impairments. The present proposal tests the hypothesis that the cumulative effects of
mTBI on CBF and BBB permeability promote post-traumatic sleep and predict neurological impairments.
Male and female mice are prepared for miniscope imaging through a cranial window and attached baseplate.
The baseplate headcap substitutes for a helmet in closed-head impact acceleration TBI. With a 15 sec transition,
miniscopes visualize CBF and BBB permeability with intraperitoneal dextrans (40-2000 kDa) in vasculature and
parenchyma, respectively. The cumulative effects of mTBI are assessed with impacts delivered twice daily, daily,
or every other day for a week. Aim 1 monitors the cumulative effects of mTBI with varying temporal spacing on
CBF concurrent with post-traumatic sleep and subacute behavioral performance. Aim 2 quantifies the extent of
dextran extravasation with post-traumatic sleep and subacute neurological performance. Neurological outcomes
include anxiety (open field), spatial memory (novel object location), and somatosensory pain (mechanical
hyperalgesia). Twice daily injuries likely show temporal summation of CBF, BBB permeability, and sleep effects,
which are recovered with longer recovery times between injuries. The integration of miniscope imaging and
closed head injury can propel future studies on physiological perturbations and clinical management of TBI."

This project will investigate the long-term impacts of an unanticipated large-scale natural disaster on the
human capital and wellbeing of exposed youth. Data will come from the Study of the Tsunami Aftermath and
Recovery (STAR), a 15-year panel study of coastal communities, households, and individuals in Aceh and
North Sumatra on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, who were at risk of exposure to the 2004 Indian Ocean
earthquake and tsunami. In contrast to previous studies of childhood aversity on long-term outcomes, STAR is
designed to leverage the natural experiment of the tsunami to study the causal effects of large-scale adverse
events on a large sample of individuals that is representative of the pre-tsunami population. Our project will
focus on respondents who were under the age of 17 at the time of the disaster and were therefore in
adolescence and early adulthood (roughly 15-31 years of age) at the 15-year follow-up. We will investigate the
separate impacts of both community- and individual-level tsunami exposures on outcomes related to human
capital spanning education, cognitive performance, and health, as well as domains of early adult life like work
and earnings, marriage, fertility, and migration. We will contribute evidence on how effects differ by age of
exposure and heterogeneity in effects between, for example, males and females, those who lost parents or
other family members. This project will also fully leverage all eight rounds of STAR panel data (one baseline
and seven follow-up rounds) to closely trace out the trajectories of child outcomes in the initial and intermediate
post-disaster periods, as well as continue to follow those outcomes into the longer-term, which will provide
detailed insights into post-disaster resiliency and recovery and into the mechanisms underlying the long-term
impacts of the disaster that studies with fewer survey rounds cannot observe."
10827981,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) – including postoperative delirium, delayed neurocognitive
recovery, and postoperative neurocognitive disorders – are associated with increased morbidity and mortality,
high costs of care, and Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).
Consistent with the recent findings that blood Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 are specific biomarkers for the early
stage of AD, our preliminary data have shown that the patients who go on to develop postoperative delirium
have more than five- and two-fold higher concentration of preoperative blood Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 than
the patients without postoperative delirium, respectively. In addition, blood inflammation biomarker interleukin-6
and C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with PND. Thus, the objective of the proposed prospective cohort
study is to determine whether blood Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 can serve as biomarkers (primary objective) of
PND and enhancers (secondary objective) of the association between inflammation and PND. The hypothesis
is that blood inflammation biomarkers are associated with PND only in the participants with higher blood
amounts of Tau-PT217 or Tau-PT181. Because it is difficult to measure the low concentrations of pTau in
blood, we will employ a newly developed and innovative nanoneedle technology, an ultra-highly sensitive
method to detect low concentrations of molecules, to measure the Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 in blood. We
will establish a system for future studies by recruiting 40 participants (> 70 years old) who will have non-
cardiac surgery under general anesthesia in two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will establish a system to measure
Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 (using both nanoneedle and Simoa for comparison) and IL-6 and CRP (using both
nanoneedle and ELISA for comparison) concentrations. We will determine their relationships with the incidence
and severity of postoperative delirium on the first three days postoperatively. In Aim 2, we will use the recruited
participants in Aim 1 to investigate the associations between these blood biomarkers and delayed
neurocognitive recovery (21 days after surgery) and postoperative neurocognitive disorder (9 months after the
surgery). PNDs will be defined using 3D Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) and CAM-Severity for
postoperative delirium, and neuropsychological tests for delayed neurocognitive recovery and postoperative
neurocognitive disorders. This high-impact prospective cohort study in older adults could provide vital
information for an R01 application to further establish Tau-PT217 and Tau-PT181 in blood as biomarkers and
parts of pathogenesis of PND. Such outcomes will promote the identification of patients with a higher risk of
PND, enable the determination of the effects of intervention(s) to reduce PND, and target PT217 and Tau-
PT181 in blood as the potential intervention of PND, promoting the development of strategies to prevent and
treat PND, ultimately mitigating the establishment of AD/ADRD."
10815787,"Project Summary
Formation and maturation of the human microbiota is associated with lifelong health outcomes, and its initial
composition is heavily influenced by the maternal vaginal microbiota. Perturbations to the maternal vaginal
microbiota in pregnancy or intrapartum are associated with increased risk of multiple health disorders from
preterm birth to developing immune or metabolic disease later in life. Factors that promote an optimal transfer of
microbes to the infant are undefined, and to date, knowledge of this critical process is largely descriptive or
correlative. We seek to overcome this barrier by applying recent advances in model development, particularly
the use of gnotobiotic animals, three-dimensional tissue culture, and cultivation of complex microbial
communities, to generate experimental evidence for host and microbial factors shaping the maternal vaginal
environment during pregnancy. With these models in hand, we will test a hypothesis proposing an entirely novel
mechanism of maternal influence on the initial infant microbiota. Breastfeeding is consistently associated with
improved infant health, reduced risk of infectious disease, and accelerated immune and microbial maturation
within the gut. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), the third most abundant component of breastmilk, serve
as prebiotics for the developing microbiota and shape immune development and tolerance at the gut epithelium.
Quite recently, it has become apparent that HMOs are systemically present during pregnancy, suggesting a
wider influence on maternal and fetal biology than previously appreciated. Clinical studies have correlated
maternal serum HMOs with vaginal microbiome signatures and genetic variants in HMO production are linked
with vaginal pathogen colonization and risk for preterm birth. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that HMOs
modulate the maternal vaginal microenvironment in pregnancy to promote growth of beneficial microbes for
seeding the infant gut and to concurrently support barrier function and limit maternal inflammation. We will test
this hypothesis by: 1) Characterizing the biological activity of HMOs towards human vaginal communities in vitro
and in humanized gnotobiotic mice, and 2) Evaluating immunomodulatory impacts of HMOs at the vaginal
mucosa using human vaginal organoids and gnotobiotic and germ-free mouse models. This research approach
is a complementary merger of the applicant’s background in microbial pathogenesis and animal models of
vaginal colonization and host-microbiome interactions, and the institutional strengths of BCM in the areas of
human microbiome clinical research, human organoid development, and microbiome innovation and
therapeutics. This high impact project will apprise the basic biology of HMO activity in the vaginal tract and
provide a therapeutic tactic to better harness the potential of HMOs in modulating vaginal microbes and immunity.
The breadth of experience necessary to complete this project is readily available through the combination of the
applicant’s experience and supporting collaborators, and will lay the foundation for new findings, publications,
and an exciting research trajectory."

The human heart shows little regenerative capacity following an injury such as myocardial infarction (MI).
Instead, the heart scars, decreasing cardiac function, and leading to heart failure. There is no clinically
meaningful regenerative therapy available for MI patients. By contrast, adult zebrafish regenerate heart muscle
after severe cardiac damage without significant scarring. This is achieved through proliferation of existing
cardiomyocytes (CMs), aided by the environment provided by non-muscle cells, such as the epicardium, a
mesothelial cell sheet covering the surface of the heart. An analogous regenerative machinery of CM proliferation
and epicardium contributions also exists in the adult mammalian heart; however, it is not sufficiently activated
for significant regeneration. Recent studies demonstrated that restoring epicardial factors through the application
of epicardial patches or co-transplantation of human stem cell-derived epicardial cells together with stem cell-
derived CMs after an MI benefit heart regeneration. Thus, enhancing the pro-regenerative activation of the
epicardium may benefit mammalian heart regeneration after MI. We and others previously found that the
zebrafish epicardium is activated by injury and aids muscle regeneration through paracrine effects and as a
source of multipotent cells. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling
epicardial activation that lead to successful heart regeneration. To this end, understanding how regenerative
responses of the epicardium are regulated in adult zebrafish will lead to new therapeutic targets that underlie the
regenerative deficiencies in mammals. To address this, using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we have identified a
transient adult epicardial progenitor cell (aEPC) subpopulation within the epicardium after heart injury.
Transplantation assays implicate a capacity of aEPCs to give rise to perivascular cells, which are critical for
coronary revascularization. Genetic ablation of these aEPCs blocks heart regeneration, suggesting an
indispensable role. Pharmacological manipulations and transcriptome analyses yielded candidate genes that
underlie the activation of aEPCs. Further, unbiased genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility using
ATAC-seq revealed putative regulatory elements that exert transcriptional regulation of these genes. We
hypothesize that activation of a progenitor cell state in the epicardium underlies successful heart regeneration.
To test this hypothesis, we propose to 1) define the cell fates and functions of the aEPCs in adult zebrafish heart
regeneration using genetic fate mapping, genetic ablation, and single-cell transplantation approaches; and 2)
define the molecular mechanisms underlying aEPC activation through genetic manipulations and analyzing
dozens of transgenic lines and mutants. The outcome of this proposal may ultimately inform approaches for
activating the epicardial progenitors to enhance the limited regeneration displayed in humans after MI."
10813093,"The preferred vascular access for hemodialysis uses an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) to increase blood
flow through a vein. Successful adaptation of the venous conduit to the arterial-like fistula environment requires
remodeling of the vein wall without excessive wall thickening, enabling mechanical strength to resist
hemodialysis procedures that puncture the AVF wall with large bore needles 3 times a week. However, the
poor maturation and patency of AVF, especially in women and requiring additional re-do procedures and
surgery, reflects our imperfect understanding of the biology of venous remodeling that leads to successful
venous adaptation to the fistula environment. This knowledge gap creates an unmet need for novel
approaches to enhance venous remodeling and thereby increase successful clinical use of venous conduits.
 During the funding period, we used an innovative mouse AVF model to show that TGF-β signaling
regulates venous adaptive remodeling to improve AVF patency; activation of both the smad2/3 (canonical) and
tak1 (noncanonical) pathways regulate venous remodeling; and endothelial cell-targeted TGF-β inhibition
regulates both collagen density and smooth muscle cell proliferation to improve AVF patency. We present
exciting new data that: 1) expression of the matricellular protein tenascin-C (TnC) is greatly increased and
colocalizes with the remodeling venous wall; 2) TnC regulates AVF patency and TGF-β signaling during
venous remodeling; 3) TnC expression is not downregulated in failed AVF; and 4) TnC knockout mice have
altered proportions of immune cells in the AVF wall. In addition, we have developed the mouse model further to
incorporate chronic kidney disease (CKD) via 5/6-nephrectomy and these AVF faithfully recapitulate human
AVF maturation. We hypothesize that modulating tenascin-C activity will alter venous remodeling, thereby
improving AVF maturation and patency. We will use our translationally relevant in vivo model, an innovative
tool using nanoparticles for local drug delivery, innovative methodology to analyze the cell composition within
the AVF wall, as well as advanced next-generation analyses using transcriptomics techniques that are
available at Yale, to test our innovative hypothesis with the following specific aims:
Aim I: Determine sex differences in TnC expression during human AVF remodeling in vivo. Aim II: Determine
whether TnC function mediates venous remodeling in mice with CKD. Aim III: Determine whether regulation of
immune cells is a mechanism of TnC-mediated venous remodeling.
 A successful outcome of this investigation will have lasting impact by establishing whether TnC
mediates venous remodeling, and thus whether regulating TnC activity is a valuable strategy for clinical
translation to enhance AVF maturation. We will also determine whether reduced AVF maturation in women is
due to sex differences in TnC function as well as in inflammation and/or immunity. We use an innovative
strategy and novel tools and models to alter venous remodeling and thereby improve AVF maturation."

Multiciliated cells (MCCs) occur in airways, ependyma and oviduct and are crucial for respiration, neurogenesis
and fertility. MCCs nucleate up to 300 motile cilia at their apical surface to generate directional fluid flow. Res-
piratory MCCs are responsible for constantly cleaning airways from inhaled pollutants and pathogens to maintain
pulmonary health (mucociliary clearance). Notably, airway ciliated cells are the primary targets for human SARS-
CoV-2 infections, and impaired clearance by defective MCCs, acquired or inherited as genetic ciliopathies, is
associated with chronic airway infections, COPD and asthma. Motile ciliogenesis is directed by > 600 ciliary
genes via sequential and hierarchically organized activity of MCC transcription factors. However, transcriptional
regulation of multiciliogenesis is only partly deciphered, with major knowledge gaps in the early phases of differ-
entiation which establish MCC fate and orchestrate centriolar amplification. E2f transcription factors, evolution-
arily conserved from plants to mammals, are major regulators of cell cycle. The canonical E2f1-6 regulate ex-
pression of genes controlling DNA replication and the mitotic machinery. In contrast, only a few physiological
scenarios are known where the atypical repressors E2f7 and E2f8 are essential. We recently identified an unex-
pected major new role of E2f7 and E2f8 in motile multiciliogenesis of airways, ependyma and oviducts. We
find E2f7 and E2f8 exclusively expressed in two cell populations of airway epithelium, the cycling basal and the
earliest MCCs progenitors. Notably, ablation of E2f7 in mice causes a profound reduction in basal bodies and
cilia numbers in airways, ependyma and oviduct. Additional loss of E2f8 further exacerbates the phenotype,
indicating physiological cooperation. We will test our hypothesis that E2f7 and E2f8 act as the switch from
proliferating uncommitted progenitors to differentiating MCC progenitors which fundamentally requires overcom-
ing the strict once-per-cell-cycle centriole duplication program of dividing cells. We postulate that E2f7 and E2f78
are critical for decoupling centrosome duplication from cell division. E2f7 and E2f78 achieve this by cooperatively
blocking DNA replication and inducing the alternate S*/G2M*-like phases which enables centriolar biogenesis.
This is followed by mainly E2f7 regulating and balancing the early MCC transcriptional program, thereby safe-
guarding centriolar multiplication. This proposal will comprehensively and systematically identify mechanisms,
molecular partners and their place in the transcriptional MCC hierarchy that underlie this new ciliary function of
E2f7/f8. Aim 1 performs single cell mechanistic and functional analyses of E2f7 and E2f8 in MCCs in primary
organotypic cultures. Aim 2 maps E2f7 and E2f8 within the MCC hierarchy and the alternate cell cycle in early
ciliogenesis. Aim 3 identifies the proximal functional protein interactome of E2f7 and E2f8 in multiciliogenesis
with functional validation. The results will greatly expand our fundamental insights into motile multiciliogenesis
and lay the groundwork for identifying potentially causal roles of dysfunctional E2f7/f8 in cilia-related human
airway and lung diseases, crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies for their prevention and treatment."
10867337,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging pathogens that cause substantial morbidity and mortality,
especially among immunosuppressed patients. While NTM are increasingly implicated in healthcare facility-
associated (HCFA) infections and outbreaks, no systematic method for NTM clinical surveillance exists. As a
result, current infection control practices inconsistently detect clinically important increases in NTM rates, or NTM
clusters, leading to delayed outbreak detection and mitigation. Furthermore, the presence of NTM in many
healthcare environments increases the difficulty of determining whether a cluster of positive cultures for a given
NTM represents polyclonal contamination from environmental sources or a true monoclonal outbreak. Therefore,
U.S. hospitals need better approaches for early detection and characterization of HCFA NTM outbreaks.
The combination of 1) systematic analytic techniques for early detection of HCFA NTM clusters and 2) molecular
epidemiology to characterize the relevant NTM represents an innovative and powerful approach to mitigating
and preventing NTM outbreaks in vulnerable populations. The overall objective of this proposal is to combine
optimized statistical process control (SPC) methods with whole genome sequencing (WGS) as an integrated
platform to improve detection and investigation of HCFA NTM clusters and outbreaks. We will use these two
techniques within a hospital network to test the central hypothesis that optimized SPC methods combined with
molecular epidemiology can detect and mitigate HCFA NTM clusters more quickly and effectively than standard
infection control techniques and ultimately reduce morbidity from NTM outbreaks. We plan to test this hypothesis
by pursuing the following three Specific Aims: 1) Develop an optimized SPC strategy for identification of clinically
important increases in rates of HCFA NTM; 2) Compare the effectiveness of optimized SPC surveillance for
HCFA NTM to traditional (non-SPC) surveillance methods; and 3) Utilize WGS to evaluate clonal relatedness of
NTM clinical isolates associated with clinically important NTM clusters. Completion of these Aims will develop a
novel strategy to identify important NTM clusters, improve understanding of NTM acquisition, and ultimately
prevent HCFA NTM infection. This work has potential to change the way healthcare facilities perform NTM
surveillance and prevent NTM infection, thereby reducing the risk of harm to hospitalized patients.
The candidate’s short-term goals include enhancing his skillsets in time series analyses, genomic sequencing,
and multicenter collaborative studies. His long-term goal is to become a successful, independent physician
scientist, well suited to lead a team dedicated to the design and implementation of novel interventions aimed at
preventing healthcare-associated infections in immunosuppressed patients. Several key factors will assist the
candidate in achieving these goals, including close oversight from experienced co-mentors, a supportive and
protective institutional environment, and completion of the proposed research and training plan."

 We have discovered that a single hydride induces global changes to both structure and dynamics within
multiple members of an enzyme family, providing a fundamental link between enzyme structure, dynamics, and
allostery that has implications to the entire oxidoreductase superfamily. Specifically, the BLVRB family are
NADPH-dependent reductases present in multiple organisms where they regulate cellular redox through the
reduction of biliverdin-to-bilirubin and a wide array of flavin substrates. While our recent publications have
revealed that coenzyme binding is coupled to global conformational and dynamic changes, we have now
discovered that there are largescale changes coupled to the oxidation state of the coenzyme as far as 23 Å
away. Thus,
structural
catalytic
the central premise of this application is that a coenzyme's hydride is globally coupled to both
and dynamic changes within an enzyme family and that such global coupling is integrally related to
function.
 The novelty here is that we will explicitly determine how a single hydride, i.e., the difference between
NADPH/NADP+, is globally linked (Aim 1) and how this global coupling controls enzyme function (Aim 2).
Further innovation includes the following. First, we have discovered that hydride-coupled networks can be
modulated by mutations directly to the enzyme/coenzyme interface but also to distally coupled sites, which
gives us the unique opportunity to determine the role of these networks in function. Second, we have
discovered that evolutionarily changing residues modulate hydride coupled networks and function, providing
remarkable insight into the evolutionary role of hydride-mediated coupling and function. Evolutionary
differences will therefore be exploited to identify allosteric networks coupled to the oxidative state of the
coenzyme and simultaneously reveal their evolutionary roles in function. Based on our preliminary data that
includes NMR, X-ray crystallographic, and biochemical studies, we hypothesize that the coenzyme oxidation
induces its own conformational change that is further propagated globally through the enzyme in multiple
BLVRB family members (referred to as “insideout” coupling) and that networks coupled to these changes
modulate function (referred to as “outsidein” coupling). We will address this hypothesis through the following:
Aim 1) Determine how a single hydride modulates the global dynamics and structure within the BLVRB
family of enzymes. NMR solution studies using CSPs, relaxation studies, and ensembles methods will be
used to determine how a single hydride imparts its global regulation to dynamics and structure using three
distinct BLVRB family members with both active site and distal differences (human, hyrax, and mosquito).
Aim 2) Determine the functional role of networks coupled to the oxidative state of the coenzyme.
Biochemical and biophysical methods will be used to determine the functional role of hydride-mediated global
regulation, which include both the role of direct interactions with the coenzyme's hydride as well as the role of
networks of communication coupled to the coenzyme (allostery)."
11005483,"Activity-dependent variation in synaptic AMPA receptor (AMPAR) content, referred to as ‘synaptic plasticity’, is
a mechanism whereby information is stored in neural networks that give rise to higher order cognitive skills
such as learning and memory. During long-term potentiation (LTP), a widely studied form of synaptic plasticity,
extrasynaptic AMPARs are recruited from nearby reserve pools, including perisynaptic regions on the cell
surface and intracellular compartments, and subsequent anchored with the postsynaptic density (PSD). A large
body of evidence spanning decades of investigation has established mechanisms by which AMPARs are
anchored within the PSD. In contrast, the molecular mechanisms that govern AMPAR synaptic targeting to
establish reserve pools of extrasynaptic receptors are largely unknown. Given that recruitment of reserve pools
of extrasynaptic AMPARs underlies the rapid strengthening of synapses that occurs during LTP, the molecular
mechanisms that establish such reserve pools are critical to our understanding of synaptic plasticity and
represent a major gap in our knowledge.
SynDIG (Synapse Differentiation Induced Gene) defines a family of four genes (SynDIG1-4) that encode brain-
specific transmembrane proteins. Here we will determine the function of SynDIG4 (SD4), also known as Prrt1
(Proline-rich transmembrane protein 1) in the regulation of the reserve pool of AMPARs. Proteomic studies
indicate that SD4 is a component of AMPAR complexes; however, SD4 is not enriched in the PSD, but instead
colocalizes with GluA1-containing AMPARs at non-synaptic sites. Remarkably, tetanus-induced LTP, which is
dependent on GluA1, is abolished in acute hippocampal slices from SD4 knockout (KO) while theta-burst
stimulation LTP (TBS-LTP), which is independent of GluA1, is not impaired. Furthermore, SD4 KO mice exhibit
profound deficits in two independent cognitive assays (Morris water maze, novel object recognition),
demonstrating a critical role for SD4 in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory. Moreover, extrasynaptic
AMPARs are reduced in SD4 KO compared with wild-type (WT) neurons. Given that reserve pools of
extrasynaptic AMPARs are critical for synaptic plasticity, we hypothesize that SD4 maintains such reserve pools
of extrasynaptic GluA1-containing AMPARs that are deployed during tetanus-induced LTP.
In this collaborative dual-PI application we propose a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach to investigate
SD4-dependent regulation of extrasynaptic GluA1-containing AMPARs with molecular, cellular, and
electrophysiological methods. In Aim 1 we will define the mechanism by which SD4 maintains extrasynaptic
GluA1-containing AMPARs. In Aim 2 we will determine whether synaptic targeting of reserve pools of GluA1-
containing AMPARs during plasticity requires SD4. In Aim 3 we will test whether homomeric GluA1-dependent
synapse plasticity mechanisms require SD4 ex vivo at multiple ages. The results of these studies will provide
molecular insight into fundamental mechanisms that govern establishment and maintenance of the reserve
pools of extrasynaptic AMPARs critical for synaptic plasticity and address a major gap in our knowledge."

Nowhere are racial disparities in cancer survival rates as striking as in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
because both the patient and the donor contribute to survival outcomes. HLA genetic features are ancestry-
informative. When ancestry-specific features are accounted for, survival disparities are diminished but major
gaps still exist between African, Hispanic, Asian and Caucasian American transplant patients. Relapse of the
blood cancer remains the chief cause of transplant failure; however, the role for the NKG2 axis, the major anti-
tumor pathway, in relapse and survival after HCT is ill-defined. The unmet need is to identify the NKG2
ligand/receptor immunogenetic factors involved in relapse and which account for disparities in survival. If these
factors were known, then prospective risk-assessment of the patient’s germline and optimized donor selection
could diminish or even abolish survival disparities across US populations. We have elucidated the survival
disparities between HCT patients of African, Hispanic, Asian and Caucasian American ancestry, and have
identified key ancestry-informative NKG2 ligand and receptor variants that impact gene expression and
survival. We propose to identify ancestry-specific NKG2 ligand and receptor missense and regulatory variation
that account for survival in each race, and examine the impact of optimal features across races to minimize or
abolish survival disparities in HCT. The specific aims are to 1) identify mechanisms that underpin NKG2
ligand/receptor expression variation in diverse races; 2) define NKG2 ligand/receptor ancestry-informative
variation for survival in each race, and 3) define survivorship disparities with ancestry-specific “ideal”
immunogenetic characteristics. The goals will be achieved through systematic analysis of NKG2
ligand/receptor variation to identify functional variants, followed by large-scale genotyping of related donor,
unrelated donor and cord blood transplant patients and donors and identification of ideal features that inform
survival within each race. The extent to which survival disparities may be diminished or even abolished through
transplantation of patients and donors with ideal characteristics will be defined. The information from this
project will increase the success of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy."

Staphylococcus aureus infections are a major global health problem and remain a significant health burden to
society. In the U.S. alone it is estimated that over three-hundred thousand cases of hospital-associated S.
aureus infections occur yearly at the cost of $2 billion. These infections also contribute to pneumonia, sepsis,
infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and other diseases. S. aureus infections and associated diseases result
from secreted virulence factors and the ability of the bacterium to survive in a wide range of environmental
niches, including hypoxic conditions. Importantly, growth and virulence are regulated by two-component
systems (TCS), which are composed of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a cytoplasmic
response regulator protein. The kinase senses the extracellular environment, and under the appropriate stimuli
transmits a signal across the cell membrane to induce phosphorylation of the response regulator, resulting in
changes in gene expression. The staphylococcus respiratory response AB (SrrAB) TCS is activated under
hypoxic conditions or in the presence of nitrosative stress and coordinates the regulation of virulence factors,
fermentation enzymes, nitric oxide detoxifying enzymes and biofilm formation. In this proposal, the PI will
pursue three aims designed to reveal the regulatory mechanisms of the SrrB sensor histidine kinase. The SrrB
HK is a transmembrane protein that contains an N-terminal extracellular Cache domain and a cytoplasmic
catalytic region (HAMP-PAS-DHpCA) containing a PAS domain. The first aim is to determine the role of the
SrrB PAS domain and how binding to heme impacts SrrB function. The second aim will identify ligands that
bind to the Cache domain and elucidate its sensing mechanism and role in virulence. The third aim will
determine the structural basis for SrrB enzymatic regulation using X-ray crystallography, SAXS and cryogenic
electron microscopy of full-length SrrB reconstituted in nanometer-scale lipid discs. Successful completion of
these studies will provide the molecular mechanism(s) by which SrrB senses extracellular ligands and cellular
redox to regulate catalytic function, and the biological consequences for disrupting this regulation. Our results
will have important implications for the design of novel therapeutic strategies targeting the SrrAB TCS to
combat antibiotic resistant S. aureus strains."
10825592,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Under physiological conditions, cells are subjected to mechanical tension that triggers multiple signaling
pathways and impacts numerous cellular processes, including cell cycle progression. It is well established that
a dysfunction of these tension-sensitive signaling pathways can cause unbalanced proliferation and pathological
tissue remodeling; however, the precise molecular pathways remain poorly defined. As cells experience tension,
the nucleus undergoes significant morphological changes due to its connection with the cytoskeleton that
transmits mechanical force to the nuclear envelope. We recently showed that nuclear flattening activates
transcription factors that stimulate G1/S transition, leading us to hypothesize that the nuclear membrane could
serve as a tension sensor whose activation is necessary for cell cycle progression. Building on these findings,
as well as on the work of others, we will test this hypothesis by applying a combination of biophysics, imaging,
and biochemical approaches to define the nuclear tension-sensitive pathways that control cell cycle progression.
In Aim #1, we will determine whether RhoA-mediated pathways increase actomyosin contractility and nuclear
envelope tension during G1 to stimulate G1/S transition. In Aim#2, we will extend our investigation to the
signaling triggered in response to an increase in nuclear tension and we will define how these signaling events
promote entry into S phase. In Aim#3, we will determine whether tension transmitted to the nucleus during
interphase stimulates mitosis progression. We anticipate that the successful completion of this project will
increase our understanding of the tension-sensitive mechanisms controlling cell cycle progression and will
identify new pharmacological targets to limit cell proliferation in pathological contexts associated with excessive
actomyosin tension."
10812518,"ABSTRACT:
Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a deadly disease of the newborn that affects 7% of patients admitted to the
neonatal intensive care unit and is a leading cause of gram negative, neonatal sepsis. Sepsis is the second
major cause of death among neonates, accounting for one million global deaths per year. Although we have
made progress understanding the effect of maternal colonization patterns on neonatal sepsis, there is a gap in
the understanding of the regulatory processes that regulate intestinal barrier function that contribute to
susceptibility to sepsis. Indeed, the intestine is the largest immune organ in the body and is responsible for
maintaining a barrier to the microbial world within its lumen. Therefore, it is a high priority for the development of
medical interventions to prevent and treat neonatal sepsis. Rho kinases (ROCK) are serine/ threonine kinases
and are involved in multiple cellular processes including regulating tight junction function, actin cytoskeleton
contraction, inflammatory cytokines and cell death. We found that Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) is
activated during NEC, and inhibition of ROCK confers protection against intestinal barrier injury and disruption
of normal TJ homeostasis. Our data suggest that TJ regulation, intestinal barrier function and apoptosis are
regulated by a ROCK dependent, caveolin-1 mediated pathway. Furthermore, we have identified differences in
TJ subcellular distribution and caveolin-1 both in patients with and without sepsis and NEC, and in those of
different gestational ages. The objective of our proposed study is to define the mechanism by which barrier loss
occurs in NEC and to leverage this in order to understand the potential of epithelial-specific ROCK inhibition in
preventing NEC and neonatal sepsis. Our central hypothesis is that the response of the intestinal barrier in
premature infants to injury is altered and is characterized by changes in epithelial ROCK signaling, aberrant TJ
regulation, increased mucosal and systemic inflammation, sepsis and epithelial cell death. We will test this
hypothesis by determining whether inhibition of TJ protein expression and redistribution or caveolin-1-mediated
endocytosis prevent paracellular permeability increases, mucosal and systemic inflammatory responses, and
epithelial cell death in experimental sepsis and NEC. The use of intestinal organoids generated from human
infants and from ROCK and caveolin-1 knockout mice, will provide tremendous translational power and allow us
to probe epithelial functions at molecular, cellular, tissue, and organismal levels. Using pharmacological and
genetic approaches, we will determine if and how TJ responsiveness and ROCK signaling increases cell death
to worsen outcomes in premature infants and whether our interventions prevent or induce sepsis. These findings
have a significant positive impact on human health by providing a new understanding of the mechanisms
governing epithelial intestinal barrier function of the premature infant during NEC and neonatal sepsis."
10894720,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Small GTPases regulate diverse cellular functions and their aberrant activation plays a key role in disease.
Perhaps most signiﬁcant is their association with cancer, a disease where KRAS is mutated in ~1/3 of
patients. With this in mind, the mechanism by which cancer hotspot mutations activate KRAS is a central
concept in cancer biology. Under physiologic conditions, KRAS cycles between an active (GTP-bound) and
an inactive (GDP-bound) conformation. Its slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis is catalyzed by GTPase-activating
proteins (GAPs). Common mutations in KRAS prevent the stabilization of the hydrolysis transition-state
leading to oncoproteins that are thought to be deﬁcient in hydrolysis, insensitive to GAPs, and constitutively
active in cancer cells (i.e., `locked' in their active or GTP-bound, state). Emerging therapies are challenging
the conventional model of KRAS oncoprotein activation. Perhaps the strongest evidence is provided by
inhibitors selectively targeting KRAS G12C, the most common KRAS mutation in lung cancer. G12C inhibitors
bind only to the GDP-bound (or hydrolyzed) conformation and trap the oncoprotein in an inactive state by
preventing the exchange of GDP for GTP. To be eﬀective, these inactive state selective drugs require intact
GTP hydrolysis by mutant KRAS. In a similar fashion, inhibition of nucleotide-exchange (as achieved by
targeting factors upstream of KRAS) has been reported to suppress mutant KRAS activation and/or tumor
growth. This and other emerging therapeutic eﬀects presented in the preliminary data of this application could
not be possible if mutant KRAS GTPases were `locked' in their active state. Our proof-of-principle
experiments suggest the presence of cellular proteins that enhance the GTPase activity of mutant KRAS and
that KRAS oncoproteins are broadly susceptible to inactive state selective inhibition. We now propose (i) to
isolate enhancers of mutant KRAS GTPase activity in cancer cells, (ii) to determine the tertiary structure of
common KRAS mutants in complex with their enhancer and (iii) to characterize the eﬀects of novel inactive
state selective drugs that suppress common KRAS mutants found in cancer. This work will explain the
mechanistic basis responsible for the physiologic inactivation of mutant KRAS and reﬁne the conceptual
model explaining how mutations activate KRAS in cancer. The proposed study will pave the way for key
advances in cancer biology with a large potential for therapeutic and translational impact in patients."

Our prior work using physical maps of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-associated genetic variation in the
context of the 3D structure of the genome in the nucleus of disease-relevant immune cell types have implicated
the kinase HIPK1 as a factor controlling SLE susceptibility. This kinase has been studied in the context of cancer,
but a role for HIPK1 in immunity, tolerance, or SLE has not been explored. In this exploratory, high-risk/high-
impact application we will use genetic and pharmacologic targeting approaches to establish whether HIPK1
regulates T cell differentiation, T cell-dependent humoral immune responses, and SLE pathophysiology in
powerful human and mouse models of follicular lymphocyte differentiation and function. The outcome of these
studies is likely to forward basic understanding of the regulation of humoral immunity and suggest a completely
novel immunomodulatory approach for the management of SLE disease."

Institutional Kidney, Urology and Hematology Advanced Research Training Program (KUH-ART). Our Multiple
PIs (MPIs) have together compiled exemplary records over the past several decades of managing productive
collaborative research programs and of educating and training outstanding young KUH scholars, including the
initial 5-year funding period of the NIDDK T32 Translational Research Training in Pediatric Nephrology

four different institutions– UCLA, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Charles Drew University of Medicine and
Science, and Harbor-UCLA Medical Center/Lundquist Institute located in the LA metropolitan area. Each of our
partner institutions is well represented in leadership to facilitate communication and collaboration among our
cores and institutional sites. In order to carry out the different KUH-ART initiatives, the Administrative Core will
have the following specific aims (1) Establish the organization and governance to support integration of KUH
expertise and resources across our partner institutions and to coordinate with the national network. (2) Support
strong communication between trainees, mentors, our cores, and sites as well as with the national network to
create a highly productive, collaborative environment. (3) Devise and implement a comprehensive tracking and
ongoing evaluation to identify weaknesses and institute continuous quality improvement. The evaluation
approach evaluation team will design and implement a novel and comprehensive tracking and continuous

10887529,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The declining numbers of biomedical scientists and a significant lack of diversity in the scientific
workforce are a grave problem that severely impacted the kidney, urology and hematology (KUH)
workforce, while these fields experienced major scientific advances. The KUH-ART proposes to create
a Professional Development Core (PDC) that will provide resources to recruit and nurture highly
effective KUH scientists not only by aggregating and curating pre-existing programs within the KUH
partner institutions, but by including new programs to expand the horizons of trainees and their mentors.
Novel programs will include the “Being a Leader” certificate course that will allow participants to master
being a leader, and the effective exercise of leadership as their natural self-expression, in real-time and
in any leadership situation. In addition, trainees will have access to the UCLA Anderson School of
Management Healthcare Specialization Courses and the Mentorship Training Program. In effect, the PDC
will be a well-designed, fully supported, well-executed program to fill the space in the pipeline between
early education and academic advancement. We plan to develop individualized, customized curricula
in the form of Individualized Trainee/Mentor Development Plans (ITMDP). The plan will focus on
honing the skills of both the trainee and the mentor that will directly impact the trainee’s development
and will be used for evaluation and feedback. We hypothesize that the KUH-ART PDC will provide the
resources needed for pipeline trainees to ensure that they acquire the knowledge and skills to
successfully traverse their individual research career paths towards independence. We propose the
following specific aims: (1) To develop the infrastructure, and implement KUH-ART trainee-specific
programs to ensure successful transition across all stages of professional development; (2) To develop
and implement programs to provide common knowledge set and skills to support all stages of
professional development; (3) To evaluate, monitor and provide feedback to trainees and mentors to
optimize professional development, based on creation of ITMDPs, and (4) to maximally link the
Professional Development and Networking cores for optimal success with the TL1 program. We are
confident that this integrated, comprehensive set of programs will foster a community of trainees
acquiring the necessary knowledge and skills to allow them to successfully navigate their academic
KUH career pathway."

The overarching objective of the KUH-ART Networking Core is to bring together all NIH-funded trainees
(Kidney/Urology/Hematology) for formal and informal opportunities to learn, communicate, interact, and
collaborate in a vibrant scientific community. This Core’s responsibilities are twofold, to: 1) ensure the
development of key infrastructure and operations that will provide peer networking and outreach; and 2) support
ongoing communication and events across the range of NIH trainees and activities of KUH-ART TL1 and facilitate
access to all Professional Development and Training Core programs. The Specific Aims are:
Specific Aim 1. To establish a digital platform to facilitate learning and social networking across all
trainee levels. After a review of available components for a learning platform, we propose to develop our system
around two robust software packages: Canvas (for repository building), and Slack (an integrated messaging
tool). This foundation will create a virtual community for KUH-ART trainees, fostering communication that is
driven by the trainees themselves. We will plan to work with other funded U2C sites to reach consensus
towards a shared digital platform architecture to link trainees across our sites.
Specific Aim 2. To facilitate communication between KUH-ART trainees and their mentors to promote
long-term trainee engagement, commitment and professional accomplishment. Aligned closely with
Professional Development Core efforts, we will use networking opportunities to facilitate career development,
including alumni and other key individuals that will foster trainees’ biomedical research insights and trajectories
in different ways (e.g., academic; industry; government; non-governmental organizations).
Specific Aim 3. To create a seamless path for communications across KUH-ART partner institutions and
networking across external programs. Across existing programs at UCLA, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center,
Charles Drew University, and the UCLA-Harbor Medical Center/Lundquist Institute, we will operationalize
methods to streamline communications, activities, content curation and delivery for sharing within our KUH-ART
network. Trainees will be able to interact, both online and in-person, with individuals within the UC2, as well as
across other training programs.
The successful implementation of this Networking Core will ensure that NIH-funded trainees in biomedical
sciences will be connected, digitally and otherwise, in a community that fosters their learning, communication,
mutual support, scientific growth, and career development."
10834231,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CULLIN-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) employ ~200 adaptor proteins to bind and ubiquitylate substrates,
and their dynamic assembly with adaptor proteins is regulated by the neddylation cycle together with the
CAND adaptor exchange factor. Several CRLs have been linked with turnover of proteins involved in aging,
cell cycle control, DNA repair, transcription, and cellular signaling pathways. Despite these advances, our
understanding of the CRL system is incomplete for several reasons. First, the majority of studies on CRLs
have focused on the functions of a small number of well-studied adaptors. As such, we have a limited
understanding of the targets and biological functions for a substantial portion of the CRL system. Second, the
many studies have been performed in cancer cell lines, leaving open the roles of these proteins in a more
physiological setting. Third, many adaptors likely have multiple substrates and function through structurally
related degrons in diverse substrates, yet we do not understand the biochemistry of degron targeting for the
majority of adaptors. Such information can broadly inform discovery of biological functions, as has been the
case for a small number of CRL adaptors such as TRCP. To bridge these knowledge gaps, our work has
focused on the development of genetic methods to rapidly identify CRL adaptor targets and cognate degron
sequences in substrates, and on the development of proteomic approaches that allow global quantification of
proteome remodeling in response to cellular, genetic, or chemical cues. In AIM 1, we build on our discovery of
10 N/C-End E3 ubiquitin ligases that recognize their targets based on sequences at their N or C-termini to
systematically elucidate their targets and roles in proteome remodeling as cells undergo differentiation to germ
cell lineages. Human stem cell differentiation to germ cell lineages is associated with alterations in the
abundance of >30% of the proteome, and we propose that N/C-End E3s play a central role in proteome
remodeling, in part via quality control dependent protein degradation. This aim also builds on our extensive
characterization of CRLs in this system, and on the development of multiple proteomic methods that provide a
quantitative understanding of protein turnover and remodeling during changes in cell state. In AIMs 2 and 3, we
further develop an experimental platform for genetic discovery of CRL targets and degrons (including regulated
phosphodegrons), as well as matching of substrates and degrons with specific CRL adaptors. We provide
examples of how these two platforms have resulted in the mechanistic dissection of new pathways for turnover
of key transcription factors involved in nutrient signaling and propose to analyze newly discovered substrate-E3
pairs using systematic biochemical and cell biological approaches. Our expectation is that these studies will
substantially advance our understanding of the molecular determinants in CRL dependent protein degradation
and will provide unique insights into mechanisms underlying proteome remodeling during changes in cell state."

 The goal of this project is to develop and validate a novel electrophysiological source imaging (ESI) approach
based on biophysically constrained deep neural networks (BioDNN), to significantly improve surgical planning in
drug resistant focal epilepsy patients. Epilepsy affects about 70 million people worldwide. For approximately 33%
of the 3.4 million Americans with epilepsy, seizures are not controlled by medications alone. Epilepsy surgery is
the most viable option for curing drug resistant focal epilepsy, only if seizure sources can be accurately localized
and safely removed. There is a clinical need to innovate technological tools for better surgical planning of focal
epilepsy. We propose in this project a novel ESI technology based on biophysically constrained deep neural
network (BioDNN) to provide accurate, robust, and objective spatio-temporal estimates of the underlying
epileptogenic zone (EZ). Of innovation is that the trained neural network, is capable of imaging brain sources
without the need to tune the model’s hyper-parameters by an operator for every new instance of data, thus
making the technique objective and easy-to-use in clinical settings. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Establishing
and Validating the BioDNN for Imaging Epileptogenic Tissue from EEG Inter-ictal Epileptiform Discharges (IEDs)
of Focal Epilepsy Patients. We will establish, optimize and validate the proposed BioDNN for imaging EZ from
IEDs in EEG in 200 focal drug resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients, in comparison to clinical “ground truth"". Aim 2.
Developing and Validating the BioDNN Model for Imaging Epileptogenic Tissue from MEG Inter-ictal Epileptiform
Discharges of Focal Epilepsy Patients. We will develop and optimize the BioDNN model for imaging EZ from
MEG IEDs and validate the MEG-BioDNN model and compare with the EEG-BioDNN model in 80 focal DRE
patients in comparison to clinical “ground truth. Aim 3. Developing and Validating the BioDNN Model for Imaging
Epileptogenic Tissue from Ictal EEG of Focal Epilepsy Patients. We will develop the BioDNN for imaging the
SOZ from scalp ictal EEG and validate it from high density ictal EEG recordings in 120 focal DRE patients, in
comparison to clinical “ground truth”. The successful completion of the proposed research will establish a novel
machine learning technology to non-invasively localize and image underlying epileptogenic tissue from interictal
and ictal electrophysiological biomarkers. The establishment of such a novel technology promises to significantly
improve the precision of intracranial EEG electrodes implantation and aid surgical planning, leading to significant
improvement in surgical outcomes, and benefiting numerous drug resistant epilepsy patients.

Chronic stress is comorbid with a wide spectrum of conditions, such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances,
and pain. Chronic stress plays a crucial role in exacerbating pain and the loss of quality of life. The mechanisms
by which stress exacerbate pain, and how these mechanisms contribute to nervous system pathology, are
poorly understood. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to rectify this deficiency.
In this application, we study how interoceptive and somatic pain inputs interact within lateral parabrachial
(PBl) circuits to affect behavioral responses to pain. We focus on interoceptive inputs from catecholaminergic
neurons with the caudal mediodoral nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) because these neurons play a pivotal
role in facilitating behavioral responses to stress and emotional stimuli. We Hypothesize that chronic stress
potentiates catecholaminergic NTS (NTScat) inputs to PBl and amplifies nociceptive signaling within PBl,
resulting in enhanced behavioral responses to pain. We propose 3 aims:
Aim 1: Noxious stimuli activate the NTScat èPBl circuit in naïve animals. We predict that: (1A) Noxious
stimuli enhances NTScat neuronal activity; (1B) Optogenetic activation of NTScat neurons causes NA release in
PBl; and (1C) Reversible inactivation of NTScat neurons results in diminished release of NA in PBl in response
to noxious stimulation.
Aim 2: Chronic stress alters dynamics of NA release from NTScat terminals in PBl. In an animal model of
chronic stress we predict: (2A) NA release in PBl evoked by noxious stimulation is enhanced by chronic stress;
(2B) PBl neuron responses to noxious stimuli are enhanced by chronic stress; inactivation of NTScat inputs to
PBl attenuates these responses; and (2C) Suppression of NTScat inputs to PBl attenuates the effects of chronic
stress on pain-related behaviors.
Aim 3: NA released by NTScat terminals presynaptically regulates sensory and affective pain inputs to PBl and
increases its excitability. We predict that NA released from NTScat afferents: (3A) Has a prolonged faciliatory
effect on spontaneous synaptic activity in PBl; (3B) Suppresses inhibitory inputs from the central nucleus of the
amygdala to PBl; and (3C) Facilitates excitatory inputs to PBl neurons from superficial dorsal horn afferents."
10817819,"The pathophysiological basis of selective neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease remains controversial. Recent genetic and biochemical analyses have uncovered aberrant LRRK2 kinase activity as a salient feature of late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) of both familial and idiopathic origin. Familial LRRK2 mutations are generally associated with elevated kinase activity. Identifying the pathophysiological processes that regulate LRRK2 kinase could provide
a critical window to understand the pathogenesis unique to PD. LRRK2 is recruited and activated at enlarged lysosomes induced by lysosome stressors, chloroquine (CO) and LLOMe. We hypothesize that LRRK2 recruitment to the stressed lysosome is part of the lysosome stress response that acts to return lysosome to the basal states. LRRK2 association with stressed lysosomes is typically transient Remarkably, the LRRK2 association with stressed lysosomes becomes dramatically enhanced in PD-associated Vps35-D620N mutant cells. This finding suggests that LRRK2 becomes excessively activated by the lysosomal stress in Vps35-D620N cells. Thus, stress-induced LRRK2-lysosome
association and activation are tightly regulated, and this regulation is disrupted by a mutation that causes familial PD. A small focused chemical inhibitor screen for additional regulators of LRRK2-lysosome association identified PKD. PKD, similar to LRRK2, is activated by lysosomal stresses, while its inactivation led to aberrant LRRK2-lysosome association and activation. This proposal aims to identify the molecular entity that recruits LRRK2 to stressed lysosomes and characterize the role of PKD-signaling pathway in LRRK2 activation and pathogenic toxicity. This proposal's completion could provide a biochemical mechanism underlying pathogenic LRRK2 activation, identify PKD as a novel regulator of LRRK2, and ascertain lysosomal stress as a pathophysiological trigger to late-onset PD"

Jul 1, 2021 – Jun 30, 2026
Project Background: Outbreaks of illness caused by consumption of fruits and vegetables
(produce) contaminated with disease-causing microorganisms have a measurable and
important negative effect on public health in the US, due to costs of medical treatment, loss of
productivity, and, in too many instances, mortality. The FDA has promulgated a Produce
Safety Rule intended to foster the implementation of preventive measures that reduce the
likelihood of microbial contamination throughout the produce industry. Broad compliance
with this rule will require education, outreach, technical assistance, inspection, and
enforcement activities beyond the scope of existing FDA programs. State food safety regulatory
agencies can assist the FDA in this public health initiative by leveraging existing programmatic
resources to create state-run produce safety regulatory programs. The Wisconsin Department of
Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection (DATCP) has worked to implement the Produce
Safety Regulatory Program (PSRP) in Wisconsin for the past five (5) years and desires to
continue.
Project Goals: The goal of this project, DATCP’s Produce Safety Regulatory Program (PSRP), is
to expand DATCP’s capacity to educate and promote further implementation of the Produce
Safety Rule to diverse members of the Wisconsin agricultural community. Project personnel
will: 1) continue to perform a jurisdictional self-assessment to determine available and needed
resources, 2) develop a dynamic inventory of produce farms in Wisconsin that are subject to the
Produce Safety Rule, 3) continue to improve and create educational, outreach, and technical
assistance programs to guide grower compliance, and 4) develop the infrastructure, along with
inspection and compliance procedures, necessary to implement a fair, effective, efficient, and
sustainable produce safety regulatory program."

This proposal describes the formation of an experienced multidisciplinary team that is well equipped to
complete a comprehensive field epidemiology study of chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu) in
the endemic region of Uddanam in South India. This India-FOCUS (India- Factors of CKDu in Uddanam Study)
team represents well-established experts in kidney disease, epidemiology environmental science, and project
management as well as extensive experience in field work in low resource settings. The India-FOCUS team,
who have long standing prior collaborations, will facilitate the successful establishment of a case control
longitudinal study that includes 400 participants with CKDu and 800 controls with repeated visits every 9
months. The recruitment strategy for participants with CKDu is designed to allow for careful study of the known
familial clustering by the inclusion of at least 100 families with 2 or more affected individuals. Recruited controls
will be matched to cases by age, sex, location and occupation. Study participants will undergo careful
phenotyping including a detailed medical history, exposure history, standardized validated questionnaires,
detailed family pedigree charts, clinical examination. The study will collect biospecimens (blood, urine, hair,
nails) from all participants at regular prespecified intervals to measure kidney function, biomarkers of kidney
injury, and biomarkers of various environmental exposures (Aim 1a & 1b). A subset of patients will undergo
detailed evaluation of heat stress and additional precise measurements of glomerular filtration rate. We will
also implement a detailed environmental sample (air, water, soil, silicone bands) collection protocol that will
parallel biospecimen collection to facilitate targeted and untargeted analyses of environmental exposures (Aim
2). The results of individual testing and environmental samples will be appropriately returned to the study
participants and the community at appropriate time points to help inform the development of effective
preventive and interventive measures (Aim 3). Study participants will be followed longitudinally and incident
CKDu cases will be identified among the controls. Our study is designed to identify the genetics, exposome
and gene-environmental interactions that represent the underlying etiology and risk factors for progression of
CKDu. Community engagement will allow the development of sustainable interventions to reduce the burden of
CKDu in these communities."

During the past two decades, prostate cancer (PCa) has become the most commonly diagnosed cancer and
ranks as the second leading cause of cancer deaths for American men. Prostate biopsy is the standard
procedure for evaluating the presence and aggressiveness of PCa. Guided by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)
and preprocedure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), small pieces of tissues are removed from the prostate.
The architectural heterogeneities are assigned a Gleason score as a quantitative description of the
aggressiveness. However, TRUS has low sensitivity to PCa. MRI has limited availability, and a spatial mismatch
can occur when co-registering the preprocedure MRI with the real-time TRUS. Therefore, standard TRUS-guided
biopsy, either with or without additional MRI, suffers from missing or under-sampling clinically significant tumors,
leading to under-grading of PCa. At-risk patients with rising blood-based biomarkers undergo repeated and
saturated biopsies, causing extra diagnostic costs and time as well as anxiety and pain.
We propose to solve this long-standing technical gap in PCa diagnosis by introducing a needle photoacoustic
(PA) probe for online guidance of TRUS biopsy. As validated in our preliminary studies on both animal models
and human subjects, quantitative multispectral PA signal analysis possesses the unique capability of objectively
characterizing the architectural heterogeneities in prostate tissues and grading of PCa in vivo. Our needle PA
probe has an all-optical design that allows a small probe dimension to avoid causing additional invasiveness to
the current biopsy procedure. Taking advantage of the optical penetration, the needle PA probe can assess the
histopathological and molecular information in a tissue volume much larger than that of a standard biopsy core.
Hence, PA pre-biopsy measurements, performed together with the TRUS needle biopsy, can provide highly
valuable diagnostic information covering the whole prostate. Core extractions can then be focused within the
suspicious cancerous region(s). The central hypothesis of this research is that a fine needle probe-based PA
prostate pre-biopsy can guide prostate biopsy, improve the core yield, and decrease false negative rates. The
objective of this study is to validate the correlation between the PA measurements and the PCa grading through
an observational human subjects study. The specific aims include investigating the performance of the needle
PA probe in accessing PCa using 1) biopsy tissue cores; 2) ex vivo human prostate samples procured through
prostatectomy, and 3) in vivo human subjects. We will leverage the research team's extensive expertise in the
clinical practice of PCa diagnosis and pathology as well as PA technology. The proposed prebiopsy procedure
is designed within the framework of current clinical practice and is therefore highly translational. The knowledge
gained in this study will prepare us to conduct a future clinical trial of the proposed diagnostic procedure in
detecting PCa. Once successfully tested, the PA pre-biopsy will benefit PCa patients by facilitating accurately
targeted needle biopsies for the early detection of clinically significant PCa."
10656950,"Project Summary and Abstract
Evading immune responses is a hallmark of cancer. Solid tumors create a microenvironment that prevent
detection of tumor cells by the immune system and block anti-tumor T cell activity. The therapeutic value of
targeting immune evasion pathways is highlighted by the recent clinical successes of alleviating T cell
suppression via immune checkpoint blockade in a handful of solid tumors. However, anti-tumor T cells are not
generated in most solid tumors, which greatly limits the application of checkpoint blockade. One reason for this
is the paucity and dysfunction of antigen-presenting dendritic cells (APCs) in solid tumor microenvironment
(TME), but the underlying pathways are poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to discover and delineate
pathways that control APC recruitment, differentiation, and function in TME. The overarching goal is to target
these pathways to enhance antigen presentation and adaptive immune responses for solid tumor
immunotherapy. I have previously developed powerful genetically engineered mouse models of sarcomas, a
type of lethal solid tumor, as well as murine models to study antigen-presenting cells. Using these tools, we
have recently discovered that retinoic acid (RA) produced by tumor cells act on tumor-infiltrating monocytes to
prevent their differential into dendritic cells, instead promoting their differentiation into immunosuppressive
macrophages. Furthermore, we have found that the cytokine IL13 promotes RA production in tumor cells.
Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that IL13-induced RA production by tumor cells prevents the
generation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells in TME. Our three specific aims will; delineate the mechanism
by which RA affects monocyte differentiation and antigen presentation (Aim 1), uncover the source of IL13 in
TME and its impact on anti-tumor immune responses (Aim 2), and examine the potential of targeting IL13 and
RA signaling for tumor immunotherapy (Aim 3). This work will have significant impact on our understanding of
immunomodulation in solid tumors and extend our understanding of how tissue metabolites can control
monocyte differentiation. Our findings will also open new avenues for solid tumor immunotherapy based on
targeting RA signaling and APCs. The clinical implications are particularly impactful for sarcomas where
current treatment options are extremely limited. Our work is innovative because it will open new avenues of
research examining the role of retinoid signaling in APC differentiation and tumor immunity. There are many
commercially available small molecule inhibitors of RA signaling, but none has been used for therapeutic
purposes. Therefore, our work will not only provide a proof of concept for RA blockade in tumor
immunotherapy, but is also amenable to rapid human translation."

The recent advent of highly potent inhibitors of the androgen receptor and androgen biosynthesis has had the
unfortunate iatrogenic effect of fueling new lethal prostate cancer phenotypes in patients. In particular, non-
neuroendocrine androgen receptor-low castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), an aggressive form of this
disease, is increasing in occurrence amongst patients and is uniformly fatal. The main barriers against
therapeutic advances are a paucity of relevant disease models and a very poor understanding of the
mechanisms that give rise to this phenotype. The process of protein synthesis has long been considered
subordinate to alterations at the levels of DNA and RNA in cancer etiology. However, work from our laboratory
and others have revealed that protein synthesis control is a dynamic process that coordinates not only bulk
mRNA translation, but also the specialized translation of distinct mRNAs important for cancer phenotypes.
Recently, our laboratory has developed and characterized a new in vitro and in vivo toolkit of both human and
murine androgen receptor-low CRPC. We have used these models to discover a critical link between androgen
receptor signaling and the process of mRNA translation initiation, which is critical for androgen receptor-low
CRPC growth. We hypothesize that androgen receptor-low CRPC is driven by the specific translation of
distinct mRNA networks, thereby leading to persistent tumor growth, which may represent a therapeutic
vulnerability. Our long-term objective is to utilize state-of-the-art mouse models, ribosome profiling, and patient
derived xenografts to definitively investigate the fundamental link between the androgen receptor and protein
synthesis control in a highly relevant and newly emerging disease course for prostate cancer patients. To do
so, we will address the following aims: 1) determine the mechanism by which the androgen receptor
communicates with the translation apparatus, 2) delineate how aberrant protein synthesis drives the translation
of distinct oncogenic mRNAs, and 3) elucidate the therapeutic efficacy of targeting translation initiation in
androgen receptor-low CRPC.
Ultimately, these studies are poised to uncover a new paradigm for gene regulation in androgen receptor-low
prostate cancer and provide the preclinical basis for targeting the protein synthesis apparatus in an
increasingly common highly aggressive disease."

 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous, systemic autoimmune disease that causes
significant morbidity and early mortality, especially in minority populations and in women of child-bearing age.
By the time patients reach SLE classification, the majority exhibit organ/tissue damage and ongoing,
aggressive inflammatory processes. Preventing SLE would reduce the risk of irreversible organ damage and
treatment-related toxicities, but requires identification and validation of drivers and restraints of disease
progression during this pre-/early-clinical time period. Our research groups have made important progress
toward deciphering aspects of preclinical autoimmunity. A few findings include showing: autoantibodies occur
in linked-subsets years before clinical disease, demonstrating humoral epitope spreading and peripheral
immune dysregulation in preclinical autoimmune transition, defining immune endotypes of autoantibody
positive healthy individuals, identifying activated B cell and select myeloid cell subsets preceding SLE disease
flare, and establishing viral reactivation preceding SLE disease onset.
 Through our newly formed ADAPTS consortium, we will address these gaps with twelve available,
complementary pre-disease unique collections that span this continuum from benign autoimmunity to active
SLE, which includes clinical data, questionnaire information, biospecimens, autoantibody and other
experimental data from nearly 11,000 participants. A subset of the highest-risk individuals earlier in this
continuum will be followed for autoimmune and clinical progression. These cross-sectional collections are
augmented with longitudinal transitional cohorts which include over 400 individuals who transition to SLE with
pre-disease samples and clinical data. Our investigative team members bring strengths in clinical investigation,
innate immunology, cell-free nucleic acid sensing, soluble mediator characterization, multi-omic analyses,
cellular immunology, immune metabolism, systems immunology, bioinformatics and strong, productive
collaborations. Building on our published and new preliminary data, our ADAPTS consortium of clinical and
basic scientists will assess potentially independent or complementary mechanisms of disease progression and
immune restraint by testing the roles of RNA-sensing pathways, cell-free nucleic acids, age-associated B cells
and autoantibody characteristics, myeloid cell subsets, T cell lymphopenia and lymphopenia-induced
proliferation, T cell immunometabolism, as well as select environmental (microbiome, virome), genomic and
innate and adaptive immune responses as drivers of SLE disease. We will also validate and refine predictive
models of clinical SLE disease development to inform future prevention trials and assist the field through
molecular and clinical endotype identification of the preclinical time periods. Data from this integrated research
program will inform targeted immune-mediated prevention trial development, selection of cellular/molecular
and pathway-directed therapies, and the design of longitudinal SLE natural history or prevention studies."

Chronic itch severely diminishes quality of life. Although several neuronal populations that are important for itch
have been identified, we lack a population-level view of the neurons that detect itch stimuli in the dorsal root
ganglia (DRG), integrate itch in the dorsal horn, and convey itch to the brain. Moreover, although kappa opioid
receptor (KOR) agonists inhibit itch, we do not yet have a clear understanding of the neural basis of the inhibition
of itch. We propose to bridge these critical gaps in knowledge with 2-photon (2P) Ca2+ imaging of neural
populations that are engaged in response to itch and those that are inhibited by KOR agonists. A network view
of how pruritic information is initially integrated—and where KOR agonists act to inhibit this circuitry—will provide
key insight into the neural coding of itch, and may elucidate new avenues for treatment. Here, we propose to
use 2P Ca2+ imaging in the ex vivo somatosensory preparation to define the neurons that are engaged by three
types of disease-relevant itch: urticaria from mass cell degranulation, the AEW model of dry skin itch, and the
SADBE model of contact dermatitis. In Aim 1 we will characterize the DRG neurons that mediate itch; in Aim 2
we will characterize the corresponding responses of spinal excitatory neurons and spinal projection neurons;
and in Aims 3 we will analyze how this pattern of activity is altered in the presence of a KOR agonist, which
inhibits itch. Overall, we will test the hypothesis that distinct types of itch engage common excitatory interneurons
and common spinal output neurons, and that KOR agonists reduce activity in one or more of these populations,
including spinal output neurons. These experiments will provide new insight into the neural circuits that mediate
disease-relevant itch and how this circuitry can be inhibited by KOR agonists through a population view of the
neurons that detect itch in the periphery, integrate itch in the dorsal horn, and convey itch to the brain."

 Adult stem cells must meet the dual demands of lifelong persistence and continued production of
derivatives, as needed. Highly proliferative stem cells that support continuously renewing epithelia, as in
human skin and intestines, are especially important medical targets of investigation to understand how
mutations initiate pre-cancerous amplification, and how stem cells might be used for regenerative therapies.
Recent investigations of Follicle Stem Cells (FSCs) in the Drosophila ovary have illuminated a detailed
picture of their behavior, including direct differentiation to two different cell types, locally graded proliferation,
independent regulation of division and differentiation, and remarkable similarities to the organization of
mammalian intestinal stem cells. FSCs now provide an exceptional opportunity to exploit Drosophila
genetics, accessibility to comprehensive high-resolution fixed and live imaging, and a relatively simple
system to examine the organization, dynamics and regulation of highly proliferative adult stem cells in detail.
 FSCs function as a community in which individual stem cells behave stochastically and compete for
niche space. FSCs directly differentiate to a quiescent cell type at the anterior face of the FSC domain and
to proliferative Follicle Cells (FCs) at the posterior face. FSCs also divide more rapidly in posterior regions
and dynamically exchange locations. FSC behaviors are substantially guided by the strength of two graded
signaling pathways (Wnt and JAK-STAT) of opposite polarity. Potential effectors of these signals will be
sought, in part, through single-cell expression profiling. Their function in regulating FSC proliferation and
differentiation will be tested using established lineage analyses of genetic variants that yield quantitative
measures of location, cell division and differentiation responses. These will be supplemented by new
methods that examine cell cycle reporters in fixed and live samples, and by developing “GRASP” reporters
of surface interactions between marked FSCs and neighboring FCs, ECM and germline cysts to explore the
mechanism of FSC conversion to FCs.
 Adult stem cell function depends on prior development of appropriate numbers and organization of
stem cells and supporting niche cells. Recent insights show that FSCs and niche cells share common
precursors, with fates acquired gradually through progressive refinement of cell locations. Potential signals
and mediators that guide specification of the first FCs will be investigated to provide complementary insights
to those gained from studying FC formation in adults, where the morphological changes and signaling
environment differ significantly.
 Genetic manipulations affecting division rates, differentiation and signaling profiles of the whole FSC
community will be used to expose community regulative mechanisms that can modify FSC behavior,
responses or the signaling environment in order to maintain stem cell numbers and function."
10799656,"Microelectrodes (ME) implanted in the nervous system are critical tools for neurophysiological research and in
clinical applications that use neuromodulation to treat motor-disability conditions. However, long term stability
and functional performance are the critical barriers for implanted ME that have limited their use in clinical
applications. Vascular disruption during ME implantation and their continued presence in the brain tissue leads
to erythrocyte/hemoglobin entry in the brain parenchyma, which results in iron to be released and accumulated
in the tissue. While iron is essential for various physiological functions, an overload of free iron contributes to
oxidative and inflammatory mediated cell damage. Our central hypothesis is that iron accumulation in the brain
tissue after ME implantation contributes towards chronic oxidative stress, microglial degeneration and
neurodegeneration and thus, results in poor neural signal quality. Congruent with our findings, we also
hypothesize that chelation of excess free iron can improve long-term functionality of implanted ME. The goal of
this proposal is to develop an iron chelation approach, by using the iron chelator deferasirox (DFO), to mitigate
the neuroinflammatory response to improve long-term performance of ME implanted in the brain. The study will
use multiple techniques that include 1) transcriptomics (qRT-PCR) of the entire brain tissue harboring the ME
to provide a macroscopic overview of ongoing inflammatory reactions and not just the tissue at the recording
sites which is commonly reported in literature, 2) spatial transcriptomics and proteomics at recording sites,
within the same tissue slice, to provide information at high spatial resolution, and 3) immunohistochemistry, all
combined with electrophysiology, to produce a comprehensive dataset with readouts of both protein and gene
expression in the brain tissue. Further, the study will use materials science and surface chemistry approaches
to develop local chelation approach for modulating iron species at the electrode-tissue interface. Aim 1 will
determine the effects of iron chelation on microglial degeneration and neurodegeneration and its impact on
neuronal recordings. Systemic administration of immunomodulatory drugs is often not the best strategy as 1)
drugs need to cross the BBB, which limits their availability at the injury site and 2) require large dosages, which
has systemic side effects. Further, studies have shown metal chelators, if present in high concentration, lose
their selectivity during systemic chelation therapy, resulting in homeostatic chemical imbalances in which other
metal ions are depleted. These concerns provide the rationale to locally modulate the iron species at the
electrode-tissue interface. Aim 2 will develop an iron chelator embedded hydrogel coating on ME for
modulating excess free iron at the electrode-tissue interface. By studying the dynamics of iron accumulation,
with and without chelation, in relation to other inflammation pathways simultaneously, the project has the
potential to uncover potential signaling targets that can be immuno-modulated for improving long-term
electrode function."
10833174,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Overexpression of Cyclin D1 (CCND1) is recognized as a major resistance mechanism to HER2 targeting
agents. Patients with CCND1 amplification have the worst response to trastuzumab-containing therapy, and
CCND1 overexpression is enough to render cancer cells insensitive to HER2 inactivation. Furthermore, tumors
that evade HER2 targeted therapy by reducing HER2 expression rely on CCND1 overexpression and are
extremely sensitive to its ablation. Thus, targeting CCND1 is a promising strategy for overcoming resistance to
HER2-targeting agents in breast cancer patients. Although CCND1 itself is not a druggable target, this protein
has a rapid turnover, and its steady-state level in cells is tightly regulated by ubiquitin-mediated degradation.
Perturbation of CCND1 deubiquitination accelerates its degradation. We have recently discovered a novel,
previously uncharacterized deubiquitinating enzyme – USP27X, whose higher expression significantly correlates
with poor survival of HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Importantly, our studies identify USP27X as a critical
regulator of CCND1 protein stability in HER2 therapy-resistant breast cancer cells. Ablation of USP27X severely
reduces xenograft tumor growth and significantly increases cell sensitivity to HER2 and CDK4/6 inhibitors. We
hypothesize that USP27X can be a key therapeutic target in HER2 therapy-resistant or recurrent breast cancer
through CCND1 degradation. This project focuses on understanding the functions of USP27X in CCND1
regulation and elucidating the roles of this deubiquitinating enzyme in cancer development and progression. We
will utilize several engineered cell lines as well as a novel and clinically relevant mouse model carrying a
conditional Usp27X allele to 1) Elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the reduced CCND1 steady-state
levels in USP27X ablated cells 2) Determine how the loss of USP27X will affect tumor development and
progression in vivo, and 3) Define how abrogation of USP27X activity alters the therapeutic response of HER2
therapy-resistant cells to HER2 inhibition. USP27X is a druggable target, and our studies will illuminate new
avenues for therapeutic intervention in HER2 therapy-resistant and CCND1 dependent cancers. Although there
are no USP27X specific inhibitors currently available, the studies proposed in this project are essential for
establishing this deubiquitinating enzyme as a drug target as they will provide a rationale for developing USP27X
specific inhibitors."
10914044,"ABSTRACT: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, with 80% of the burden in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Yet, the epidemiology of CVD in LMICs is poorly understood given
the absence of population-based local data. In 2018, we established the Haiti CVD Cohort (HL143788), the
first population-based longitudinal CVD cohort in the region to estimate the prevalence of adjudicated CVD
risk factors, diseases, and their association with poverty-related social and environmental determinants. We
successfully enrolled 3,005 Haitians and found:
environmental

national
1) 30.4% had hypertension (HTN); 2) stress, high salt diet, and
lead exposure were associated with increased blood pressure; and 3) 11.6% had heart failure
with higher rates among adults <40 years ( This data has informed
HTN guidelines and interventions for CVD treatment.
4.5% in Haiti vs 0.3% in the US).
With renewal of this R01, we can extend follow-
up of this well-characterized cohort to ~22,000 PY to capture critically important incidence data spanning
risk factors, events, and poverty-related determinants needed to inform CVD prevention. We will estimate
incidence rates across strata and identify high-risk subgroups and population-level modifiable factors that can
be targets for future evidence-based CVD prevention. This study is uniquely positioned to address hypotheses
specific to CVD in LMICs and among young Black populations, where data in the US is sparse. We
hypothesize uncontrolled HTN increases risk for incident HF in young adults, and environmental lead and high
dietary salt are major population-level modifiable factors associated with incident CVD. Our Specific Aims are:
1. Determine the 7-year incidence of CVD risk factors and adjudicated events in the Haiti CVD Cohort.
 CVD risk factors include HTN, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, kidney disease, poor diet, smoking,
physical inactivity, and inflammation. CVD events include HF, stroke, transient ischemic attack, angina,
 myocardial infarction, and CVD mortality.
2. Identify predictors of incident CVD risk factors and events, including poverty-related social and
 environmental determinants. We will identify modifiable predictors and high-risk subgroups for future
individual-level interventions, with power to detect minimal HRs ≥1.2 across exposures with 10-50%
prevalence. We will identify population-level modifiable factors using population attributable risks.
3. Characterize the local context to identify optimal implementation strategies for future evidence-
 based interventions to prevent CVD at the individual and population level. We will use mixed methods
 including multisector qualitative interviews and surveys to understand the contextual factors influencing the
 implementation of future interventions targeting quantitative data in Aims 1-2.
This research is essential for fighting the CVD epidemic in LMICs, is enthusiastically supported by the Haitian
Ministry of Health, and will inform our understanding of CVD health disparities in the 21st century."
10840453,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The early and accurate diagnosis of congenital abnormalities using prenatal genetic screens and diagnostic
tests (PS&D) is pivotal for patients to make healthcare decisions informed by medical facts and their values
about pregnancy, children, family, and reproduction. A core component of high-quality, evidence-based, and
equitable prenatal care, PS&D are also significant because congenital abnormalities are one of the leading
causes of infant mortality in this country. The data obtained from testing is significant; it may lead some to un-
dergo additional procedures to optimize neonatal outcomes or, if a serious condition is identified, to end the
pregnancy. Given the ramifications of these decisions for the patient and family, it is a priority to ensure that all
pregnant patients can make decisions about PS&D that are informed and meet their needs and values. An ur-
gent problem exists: Patients face significant barriers to making informed decisions about the use of PS&D, the
first step to evidence-based, ethical, and equitable access to these healthcare resources. As a result, there are
insufficient mechanisms to provide informed and equitable access to the four million patients who seek prena-
tal care in the U.S. each year. The goal of this study is to ensure that pregnant patients have the resources
and support needed to access PS&D in an informed and evidence-based fashion by (1) developing an innova-
tive digital tool to support patients' decision-making and (2) contributing fundamental knowledge to advance
science in a way that promotes patients' access to new prenatal applications of genomic science and technol-
ogy. Our central hypothesis is that, by focusing on patient engagement as a key driver to improve patient
outcomes, the use of an evidence-based artificial-intelligence (AI) powered patient engagement tool will in-
crease patients’ ability to seek information and structure a decision-making process that, in turn, (1) in-
creases informed decisions about PS&D and (2) decreases decisional conflict associated with those deci-
sions. This project is innovative because it will apply AI medical technologies to support patients' informed ac-
cess to PS&D and providers' efforts to structure patient-centered prenatal care, understanding diverse patient
populations' technology experiences, resources, and attitudes about its use in prenatal care decisions. This
study is significant because it will bridge the gap in existing data needed to overcome persistent barriers to pa-
tients' informed access to PS&D that remain unmet, addressing factors that critically impact prenatal care qual-
ity, safety, and outcomes. These results are expected to have an important positive impact on public health, as
informed access to advances in genetic technologies is foundational to the ethical practice of medicine and a
key component of healthcare quality, access, and outcomes. We anticipate that this study’s findings will ulti-
mately contribute to preparing pregnant patients and their partners to make informed choices that reflect their
needs and preferences as individuals and parents."

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common, life threatening disease that affects
1/400-1/1000. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 and PKD2, which encode polycystin-1 and
polycystin-2 (PC1 and PC2). Remarkably, the function of the polycystins remains enigmatic almost 30
years after their cloning and 20 years after their discovery on renal primary cilia. Besides cilia, PC1 and
PC2 are also found in other subcellular locations including extracellular vesicles (EVs). Urinary EVs can
be used as biomarkers of renal disease including ADPKD. Whether these polycystin-carrying EVs are of
ciliary origin and what role EVs play in healthy and diseased kidneys remains unknown. In the model
organism C. elegans and mammals, the polycystins LOV-1/PC1 and PKD-2/PC2 are architecturally
similar, act in the same genetic pathway, function in a sensory capacity, localize to primary/sensory cilia,
and are shed in EVs, suggesting ancient conservation. We will use our established C. elegans model and
fluorescently labeled ciliary EV cargoes PC1 (LOV-1) and PC2 (PKD-2) to study ciliary EV shedding,
bioactivity, and targeting in living animals. Super resolution, real time imaging reveals that LOV-1 and
PKD-2 co-localize on ciliary EVs and that cilia shed polycystin-carrying EVs from two distinct sites - the
ciliary tip and the ciliary base. Ciliary tip EVs shedding is triggered by mechanical stimulation and functions
in animal-to-animal communication. For example, males deposit PKD-2-carrying EVs onto the vulva of the
hermaphrodite during mating. We also used PKD-2::GFP to enrich and profile the C. elegans EV
proteome, and, more specifically, the polycystin EV signalosome. We hypothesize that polycystin-carrying
EVs act as discrete signaling units and carry specific cargo for biogenesis, cargo sorting, signaling, and
targeting. In Aim 1, we will define the relationships between polycystins and the components of polycystin-
carrying EVs. In Aim 2, we will ascertain the function of polycystin-associated EV cargo and test the
hypotheses that the polycystins and associated proteins function as a signalosome in ciliary EVs and in
ciliated sensory neurons. In Aim 3, we focus on EV function in health and disease by studying PKD1
and PKD2 pathogenic mutations and variants of uncertain significance in our C. elegans model. This
competing renewal application will uncover the fundamentals of ciliary EV biology and the functions of the
polycystins on cilia and EVs. Our studies will provide insight about the biology of normal and pathological
processes that require or are modulated by EVs including ciliopathies."

Pathogenic fungi of the genus Cryptococcus contribute to nearly 200,000 deaths annually world-
wide. However, not all Cryptococcus isolates cause lethal infections; some are relatively benign
whereas others are hypervirulent. Differences in pathogenicity are often correlated with variation
in speciﬁc morphological and physiological features such as the ability to grow at high tempera-
tures, the size of the protective polysaccharide capsule surrounding the yeast cell, or resistance to
antifungal drugs. To advance the understanding of Cryptococcus biology and cryptococcal disease,
we seek to identify genetic differences between isolates and species that lead to changes in viru-
lence and virulence-related traits, to disentangle the effects of genetic variants on gene networks
and pathways that govern such traits, and to understand the ecological interactions that contribute
to pathogenesis.
 We propose to apply population and quantitative genomic approaches and microbial experi-
mental evolution to dissect the genetic basis of variation in virulence and virulence-related traits in
Cryptococcus. We propose three inter-related speciﬁc aims: Aim 1) Build mapping populations and
carry out Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping in Cryptococcus neoformans, Cryptococcus deneofor-
mans, and Cryptococcus gattii to identify genes and alleles that contribute to differences in virulence
traits and resistance to anti-fungal drugs; Aim 2) Employ a novel chemical epistasis approach to
dissect the impact of natural variation on signaling pathways and transcriptional networks that
control virulence traits; and Aim 3) Utilize trait mapping and experimental evolution to identify
genetic variants that modulate interactions between Cryptococcus and phagocytic amoeba and test
whether these variants correlate with virulence in cellular and animal models of fungal disease."

The brain tumor microenvironment (TME) is dominated by myeloid cell infiltrates which are mostly brain resident
microglia and infiltrating glioblastoma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs). Despite this fact, most clinical trials for
glioblastoma have been directed to T cell-based immunotherapies, which have failed to impact outcome for most
patients. Targeting glioblastoma based on re-education of GAMS to enable immunological clearance is the goal
of this clinical trial. The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a negative regulator of both
innate and adaptive immunity and this pathway is markedly up regulated in the TME. We have previously
developed and tested, in the context of Phase I clinical trials, a first-in-man blood-brain-barrier penetrant small
molecule inhibitor of STAT3, designated WP1066. The Phase I trial results have shown that WP1066 is well
tolerated and is inhibiting the STAT3 target in immune cells. As a monotherapy, WP1066 treatment has
demonstrated the ability to stimulate robust anti-tumor response in multiple preclinical studies that is further
enhanced with radiation therapy, which is standard of care for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and is known to
increase tumor immunogenicity. Unbiased nanostring analysis of treated tumors revealed that activation of
antigen presentation in the TME with the combination treatment. For the research proposed here we want to
extend our preclinical findings to newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients. In this clinical trial, we will test the
hypothesis that the administration of WP1066 with radiation will induce T cell-dendritic cell cluster interactions in
the glioblastoma microenvironment, and this induction, in turn, will increase progression free survival (PFS) for
glioblastoma patients. In specific Aim 1, we conduct a Phase II trial with an expansion cohort for the combination
of WP1066 and radiation in newly diagnosed MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma patients. In cohort 1, newly
diagnosed MGMT unmethylated, IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma patients will be treated with 8 mg/kg of WP1066
while undergoing standard-of-care radiation therapy at a daily dose of 2 Gy. PFS will be used to ascertain if there
is indication of treatment benefit. In cohort 2, patients for whom gross total resection was not achieved will be
treated with the combination of radiation and WP1066 with the intent of obtaining treated tumor, if a surgically
amenable lesion is present. Such tissue would allow for analysis of TME immune activation and cluster
interactions, drug concentrations and target engagement in Aim 2. Aim 2 will also use longitudinal textural MRI
analysis to correlate inflammatory responses in the TME by using our STAT3-specific multiplex immune
fluorescent panel and complementary ex vivo flow cytometry and nanostring profiling. STAT3 target inhibition,
including within specific immune cell populations, will be ascertained through use of the multiplex panel, which
will also inform regarding the induction of cluster interactions in the tumor. HPLC quantification of WP1066
concentrations in both enhancing and non-enhancing tumor will be used to determine drug pharmacokinetics. In
Aim 3, we will clarify which human GAMs in the TME trigger T cell activation, and if such activation is altered by
STAT3 inhibition."
10839489,"Mapping proximal and distal splicing-regulatory elements
PROJECT SUMMARY
Alternative splicing (AS) of precursor mRNA is a molecular mechanism that allows single genes to generate
multiple transcript and protein isoforms, providing a major driving force of molecular diversity in mammals
including humans. AS is tightly regulated temporally and spatially to determine the types and level of protein
products expressed in specific cellular contexts. Such regulation is dictated by numerous splicing-regulatory
elements (SREs) in the alternative exon or flanking introns that are recognized by RNA-binding splicing factors.
Aberrant splicing caused by disruption of SREs is implicated in an expanding list of genetic diseases ranging
from neurological disorders to cancer, as well as phenotypic variation in human populations. This is reflected in
recent findings that splicing quantitative trait loci (sQTLs) are as prevalent as gene expression QTLs, and they
are similarly enriched in genetic variants associated with human diseases identified by GWAS. In addition,
modulation of splicing or correction of dysregulated splicing has become a powerful therapeutics approach.
Despite the remarkable progress of the field, identification of causal splicing-disrupting variants and therapeutic
targets has been severely impeded by the lack of comprehensive SRE annotations in the human genome, as
compared to similar maps of transcriptional or epigenetic regulatory elements. To fill in this tremendous gap,
this study proposes an unbiased, high-throughput screening approach to map functional SREs, including those
in distal regions that are largely overlooked by current studies. If successful, this platform technology will facilitate
the genomic research community to study gene expression regulation, elucidate genotype-phenotype
relationships, and develop RNA-based medicine."
10881913,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a highly morbid condition, in large part due to secondary brain
injury from Early Brain Injury (EBI) and Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI). EBI occurs 1-3 days after ictus and is
characterized by blood brain barrier breakdown, neuroinflammation, and neuronal cell death. DCI occurs 4-12
days after ictus and results from a combination of large artery vasospasm and microcirculatory deficits. Given
that EBI and DCI are caused by wide-ranging neurovascular deficits, we believe that effective SAH therapy will
require a multiplicity of protective effects to maximize the chance of efficacy. We therefore applied a powerful
protection strategy with known pleiotropic effects – Conditioning-based therapy – to experimental models of
SAH. Conditioning is a concept whereby the brain's inherent resistance to injury can be enhanced by exposure
to non-harmful stress stimuli. Previously, we showed that hypoxic conditioning initiated before SAH (Hypoxic
Preconditioning) provides robust protection against DCI in an eNOS-dependent manner. Recently, we extended
upon these results in three important ways: 1) We showed that hypoxic conditioning initiated 3h after SAH
(Hypoxic Post-Conditioning; HPostC) also produces robust neurovascular protection; 2) We showed that the
NAD+-dependent deacetylase, Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), is a key mediator of this protection; and 3) We showed
preliminarily that Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) is likely a key upstream molecule driving the
neurovascular protection afforded by HPostC. NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme in the NAD+ salvage pathway
that converts nicotinamide (NAM) to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) enabling biosynthesis of NAD+, which
is an essential co-factor of SIRT1 leading to its activation.
In the present grant, we will test our central hypothesis is that NAMPT-driven NAD+ production plays a causal
role in the neurovascular protection afforded by HPostC in SAH, and that this protection is either partially or
completely SIRT1-mediated. The Specific Aims are (1) Test the hypothesis that NAMPT is necessary for the
EBI and DCI protection afforded by HPostC in SAH; (2) Test the hypothesis that therapeutic strategies designed
to augment NAMPT activity or increase NAD+ levels mimic the EBI and DCI protection afforded by HPostC in
SAH; and if so, determine if this protection is partially or completely SIRT1-mediated; and (3) Determine the
translational potential of therapeutic strategies targeting NAMPT and NAD+ by assessing their impact on long-
term cognitive deficits after SAH. Methods used include: (a) Two complementary mouse models of SAH; (b)
Assessment of NAMPT, NAD+, and SIRT1 levels; (c) Assessment of neuroinflammation, neuronal cell death,
vasospasm, microcirculatory deficits, and short- and long-term neurobehavioral deficits; (d) Pharmacologic and
genetic inhibition of NAMPT and SIRT1; and (e) Pharmacologic and genetic augmentation of NAMPT or NAD+.
Overall, the work proposed in the present grant has the potential to identify an entirely new therapies for the
treatment of patients with ruptured brain aneurysms – NAMPT activation or NAD+ augmentation. If successful,
these studies will result in an improved understanding of the breadth, mechanism, and sustainability of HPostC-
induced neurovascular protection in SAH and determine the translatability of NAMPT- and NAD+-directed
therapeutics."

How a single inhibitory hormone can balance the inhibition of beta and alpha cells is a major and poorly
understood aspect of islet physiology. The central hypothesis is that the pancreatic delta cell coordinates with
beta cells to attenuate insulin and glucagon secretion by inhibiting Ca2+ and cAMP while concurrently
remodeling the F-actin cytoskeleton to limit exocytosis. The rationale for the proposed research is that
elucidating the mechanisms and circumstances of delta inhibition of alpha and beta cells would establish a better
understanding of the physiological role of delta cells. This hypothesis will be tested in 3 specific aims. Aim 1 tests
the hypothesis that beta and delta cells coordinate responses largely independently of gap junctions via the
exchange of paracrine factors. Beta and delta cell calcium behavior will be quantified across hundreds of beta
and delta cells in the same intact islets by GCaMP6. Dye injection experiments will determine if gap junctions
can account for the coordinated delta and beta cell behavior. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that endogenous delta
cell feedback inhibition leads to robust intra-islet elevations of SST that coordinate alpha and beta cell
behaviors via the combined inhibition of cAMP and Ca2+. Beta cells primarily respond to glucose with Ca2+.
Insulin release is potentiated by cAMP. Ca2+ and cAMP will be quantified across hundreds of alpha and beta cells
expressing biosensors for Ca2+ and cAMP in islets with or without SST. We will quantify local SST release via
unique Sstr2 and Sstr3 (ant)agonists to determine the relative importance of cilia SSTR3 and cell-surface Sstr2.
Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that activation of SSTR2 and SSTR3 on alpha and beta cells differentially inhibits
exocytosis by remodeling the cortical F-actin network by activating RhoA GTPase. F-actin remodeling will be
tested directly using FRET biosensors for RhoA expressed by stable MIN6 cells and primary islets in response to
SST, by measuring dynamic remodeling of cortical F-actin via LifeAct, and by quantifying transcriptional changes
to stimulation of primary alpha and beta cells with SSTR2 and SSTR3-selective agonists. The research is
conceptually and technically innovative, in the applicants' opinion, as it evaluates the important physiological
role of delta cells within intact islets in attenuating alpha and beta cell activity. It attains this by applying new
technologies to overcome the hurdles that have previously precluded such studies. This is significant because
delta cell control over glucagon and insulin secretion has broad translational importance towards novel strategies
to curb the diabetes epidemic in the US."

Glomerular disease manifests as nephrotic syndrome with high-grade proteinuria with co-morbidities, and is characterized by podocyte injury and loss, which are critical determinants of disease progression. Glomerular disease can unfortunately be frequently refractory to current treatments, leading to progression to chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease. Thus, there is an unmet medical need to identify more effective and less toxic podocyte-targeted treatments for glomerular disease. We have previously demonstrated that PPARγ agonists and thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone, protect podocytes from injury, reduce proteinuria and glomerular injury in an animal model of glomerular disease, and improve clinical outcomes in nephrotic syndrome. Despite these advances, lack of their podocyte-specific mechanistic understanding and unwanted side effects has impeded their robust clinical application. Their widespread use as anti-diabetic drugs has also been under scrutiny, which has however led to the emergence of more selective modulators of PPARγ which have shown promise in recent clinical trials (NCT02638038). Motivated by these developments and to enable the clinical application of PPARγ modulation, here we seek to move away from traditional agonists and toward selective modulation of PPARγ for the treatment of nephrotic syndrome. Our recent data reveals that GQ-16, a more selective modulator of PPARγ, that binds to PPARγ distinctly from traditional agonist pioglitazone, reduces proteinuria and nephrotic syndrome-associated comorbidities in a rat model of minimal change disease with high efficacy, while resulting in reduced adipogenesis and lipid accumulation, compared to pioglitazone. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that pioglitazone and GQ-16 activate or restore common and distinct glomerular genes and pathways. These downstream effects in podocytes are likely directed by the PPARγ1 splice variant, distinct from the adipocyte-γ2 variant. Based on these findings, our central hypothesis is that PPARγ can be selectively modulated for better targeted therapeutic treatment for nephrotic syndrome with reduced side effects and that its podocyte-protective effects are regulated transcriptionally. To test our central hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims: 1) Determine podocyte-specific direct transcriptional targets of PPARγ, and 2) Determine the beneficial role of selective modulation of PPARγ in treating nephrotic syndrome. Successful completion of these studies will advance the understanding of podocyte-specific PPARγ signaling and identify a potential therapeutic strategy to treat podocytopathies by a next generation PPARγ-modulator."

Current tuberculosis (TB) control in the presence or absence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
is suboptimal: Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), the sole TB vaccine in clinical use, provides only limited
protection during childhood and multi-drug chemotherapy faces challenges due to the alarming spread of drug
resistance. An integrated approach combining chemotherapy with a therapeutic vaccine given after exposure to
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) could be a way forward. TB vaccine research mostly focused on prophylactic
candidates aiming to prevent infection. Therapeutic TB vaccines with novel mechanisms of action are needed
(i) to complement existing chemotherapy and prevent relapse thereafter, and (ii) to cure latent TB infection (LTBI)
or prevent reactivation. T lymphocytes are critical for the control of TB infection and the specific T cell response
elicited by a vaccine has been used as a key correlate of immunogenicity. In contrast, B cells are understudied
in all areas of TB research. Using a deep immunophenotyping approach, our preliminary data in mice suggest
that TB infection leads to dramatic changes in the landscape of B cell subpopulations. We identified a novel B
cell subset with marginal zone (MZ) phenotype that was activated, had a memory phenotype and expressed
receptors recognizing the human cytokines A Proliferation-Inducing Ligand, APRIL, and B cell Activating Factor,
BAFF, critical for B cell development and survival. Functional studies indicated that murine MZ B cells contributed
to Mtb containment in mice. Surprisingly, these B cells expressed a panel of Th1 cytokines, well studied in T
cells, suggesting a possible role in the first line of defense against TB infection. We found that MZ B cells were
depleted in blood of TB patients and TB/HIV coinfected people. Our hypothesis is that MZ B cells can be restored
by antitubercular therapy and harnessed for TB vaccine development. To test this, we genetically engineered
BCG to express the human cytokines APRIL and BAFF that stimulate development and longevity of BAFF
receptor- and APRIL receptor-expressing B cells, including MZ B cells. We will determine the safety,
immunogenicity and prophylactic efficacy in mice. The therapeutic efficacy will be evaluated in two novel
innovative mouse models that allow us to determine the capacity of cytokine expression in BCG strains to prevent
relapse after drug treatment and to reduce the reactivation frequency of paucibacillary TB mimicking aspect of
LTBI in humans. We will determine the frequency of MZ B cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
from people having LTBI and TB, across HIV status, including antitubercular and antiretroviral therapy. We will
stimulate PBMC of the same cohorts with cytokine-expressing BCG strains to study the immunological
consequences and to demonstrate, in principle, the feasibility of these vaccines during therapy of TB, HIV and
TB/HIV coinfection. We will monitor the global landscapes of T cells and B cells by high parameter flow cytometry
to define immunological correlates of TB infection and vaccine protection. Our proposal will determine whether
B cells can be harnessed by cytokine-secreting B cell-targeting BCG vaccines for TB vaccine development."
10893511,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Much remains unknown about how the presence or absence of insurance coverage for in-vitro fertilization
(IVF) affects the health outcomes of women and infants, health care utilization, and IVF use among less
affluent and younger women. The investigators’ long-term goal is to generate compelling new evidence that
can improve the health of women and infants. The objective of this application is to quantify the impact of
insurance coverage for IVF on women with infertility and their infants. The central hypothesis is that insurance
coverage for IVF is associated with improved IVF-related health outcomes for women and infants; reduced net
health care utilization and total medical expenditures during the first year after birth; and increased IVF use
among less affluent and younger women by mitigating a key financial barrier that influences how women use
IVF. The rationale for this project stems from the fact that few health insurance plans cover IVF, which leads to
two main issues. First, many women forgo or delay using IVF due to cost, and IVF is more successful and has
fewer complications when performed at younger ages. Second, when left to pay $15,000 out-of-pocket for an
IVF cycle, women have a financial incentive to increase the likelihood of a birth by transferring multiple
embryos during that IVF cycle. There is no additional cost to patients for transferring multiple embryos, but
doing so greatly increases the chance of having high-risk twin, triplet, or other higher-order multiple births.
Surveys of diverse women with infertility have shown that they are willing to transfer fewer embryos per IVF
cycle if IVF is covered by insurance. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three Specific Aims: 1)
Evaluate the impact of insurance coverage for IVF on health outcomes for women and infants; 2)
Determine the impact of insurance coverage for IVF on health care utilization; and 3) Examine the
impact of insurance coverage for IVF on IVF use in different income and age groups. All three Aims will
be completed using a large, national sample of commercially insured women aged 20-45 years from 2001-
2019, and will identify women who undergo IVF cycles both with and without insurance coverage and the
infants born from those IVF cycles. The proposed research is innovative because it uses a novel approach to
identify IVF cycles in claims data, including IVF cycles paid for out-of-pocket. In addition, this approach will
allow–for the first time–a robust examination of multiple maternal and infant health outcomes and health care
utilization for one year following IVF and childbirth. The proposed research is significant because it will answer
important questions about the potential benefits to women, infants, and the health care system of insurance
coverage for IVF and will provide evidence to guide major stakeholders. In particular, a better understanding of
the impact of insurance coverage for IVF will lead to healthier women and infants by providing patients,
employers, and policymakers with actionable knowledge that will help them make evidence-based decisions
about insurance coverage for IVF."
10841031,"Fear-related disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are often characterized by an
inability to inhibit and extinguish fear memories leading to pathological expression of fear-related behaviors.
For progress to occur with targeted rationally-designed therapeutic approaches, a greater understanding of
the neural circuitry mediating fear inhibition and extinction is needed. This proposal utilizes cutting-edge, cell-
type specific approaches targeting circuits that control amygdala fear inhibition and extinction, via medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) cell-type specific neural pathways, to align with
NIMH research priorities by cutting across RDoC domains in the NIH strategic plan for identifying the
pathophysiology of fear-related disorders.
 It is critical that we understand the role of specific cell types projecting to the amygdala supporting fear
inhibition and fear extinction learning. This Competitive Renewal expands our prior work dissecting function of
cell-type-specific mechanisms in the amygdala that differentially mediate fear and extinction. In addition to
other neuronal subtypes, our prior work dissected roles of the CRF and Thy1-specific neuronal populations
within the mouse Basolateral Amygdala (BLA) nuclei, demonstrating distinct molecular and physiological
functions underlying fear and extinction pathways. Here we aim to extend this work using a variety of
currently available intersectional circuit dissection tools, to understand the role of medial prefrontal cortex
(mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) projections in regulating amygdala CRF and Thy1 populations.
 We predict that this approach will identify novel pharmacological targets for fear inhibition and
extinction, pursuing new pathways for fear-related anxiety disorders. Our central hypothesis is that the
specific pathways within the mPFC and vHPC to BLA circuits, involving projections to fear-controlling
amygdala CRF- and Thy1-positive cells, contribute to the mechanisms of fear retention. Targeting
these specific pathways will provide greater understanding of fear inhibitory control. This hypothesis will be
tested through the following Specific Aims: 1) Explore the role of mPFC and vHPC projections to CRF and
Thy1 cells in amygdala in control of fear and extinction. 2) Identify activity patterns in mPFC and vHPC
neurons projecting to fear-controlling cells in amygdala using GCaMP miniscope and fiber photometry. 3)
Explore synaptic and network-level mechanisms of repeated stress-triggered fear renewal, focusing on mPFC
and vHPC projections to amygdala CRF and Thy1 positive neurons, respectively. 4) Perform cell type
specific RNA profiling of amygdala-projecting mPFC and vHPC neurons (both CRH/Thy1 targeted cells and
engram activity dependent cells) with and without chronic stress. The identification of novel targets will
advance our understanding of circuitry underlying fear behaviors and will provide unique avenues for
therapeutics."
11145558,"Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis in the cell and are essential for growth and cell
division. Genetic defects that interfere with ribosome biogenesis reduce translation and growth
and cause human diseases. Heterozygous mutation of many ribosomal protein genes causes
Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, which is associated with early onset anemia, morphological defects,
and cancer predisposition. Ribosomal protein genes are also haploinsufficient in the fruitfly
Drosophila, where they cause reduced protein synthesis, slow growth and development, and
morphological defects. Unexpectedly, these effects are found to have a transcriptional basis, that
is, ribosomal protein mutations activate a transcriptional program which controls translation and
the other effects. This project will determine how ribosome biogenesis defects cause human
diseases and cancer by elucidating the molecular mechanisms of this transcriptional response in
Drosophila, and exploiting mutations that prevent cells reacting to ribosomal protein mutations.
The project will use ribosome profiling methods to define the hierarchy of steps at which
translation of the genome into protein is altered and highlight those likely to be relevant to
cancer, anemia, and morphology. The project will use gene modification approaches to define
the specific roles of individual protein isoforms and domains in the effects of ribosome
biogenesis defects. The project will explore what physiological and selective role is played by
the cellular responses to ribosome biogenesis defects, and their contribution to promoting health

10848340,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cancer cachexia (CC) is a wasting syndrome characterized by decreased appetite, weight loss, and muscle
wasting in cancer patients leading to decreased physical function and poor quality of life, shortened lifespan, and
higher medical costs. To this date, there is no approved treatment for CC. Paradoxically, muscle wasting and
weakness are also very common side effects of some chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, a first-line
therapy for several cancer types. Since current interventions for preventing or treating cachexia associated with
cancer or cisplatin are suboptimal, there is an urgent need to develop new therapies to improve muscle mass
and function in these conditions.
5’-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an intracellular energy sensor that plays a
central role in skeletal muscle physiology through the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism. It
has also been shown to decrease inflammation in a variety of cell types. AMPK is of particular interest in the
context of CC because, although the mechanisms underlying cancer cachexia are not fully understood, one of
the primary triggers of CC is increased inflammation and oxidative stress. Impaired mitochondrial function
is also thought to be one of the main contributors to muscle dysfunction in CC. However, the function of AMPK
in CC, as well as its potential therapeutic role in preventing muscle wasting and weakness are not known. This
study aims to characterize the role of AMPK in cisplatin- and lung cancer tumor (Lewis Lung Carcinoma, LLC)-
induced CC, and evaluate the potential for modulating AMPK as a therapeutic target for these conditions.
Specific Aim 1A will investigate if genetic (AMPKα2 activity inhibited) or pharmacological inhibition of AMPK
(Compound C) exacerbates cisplatin-induced muscle wasting and dysfunction in mice; whereas promoting
AMPK activation by its agonist AICAR attenuates this myopathy. Specific Aim 1B will determine whether
activating AMPK attenuates cisplatin-induced myopathy in C2C12 myotubes and characterize the signaling
pathways involved. Specific Aim 2A will determine if AICAR attenuates LLC tumor-induced muscle wasting and
dysfunction and Compound C exacerbates these deficits, and Specific Aim 2B will determine the same effects
of AMPK modification on LLC media-cocultured C2C12 myotubes and elucidate the underlying molecular
pathways. The overall hypothesis is that AMPK is essential for maintaining muscle function during cachexia;
promoting AMPK activation by AICAR counteracts cisplatin- or tumor-induced muscle wasting and weakness,
whereas inhibiting AMPK activation will exacerbate this myopathy. We postulate that the effects of AMPK are
mediated by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress while promoting mitochondrial function. Ultimately,
our findings from this study will provide evidence of the potential therapeutic role of AMPK in CC, and benefit
cancer patients by improving their quality of life and longevity. This project will also allow me to transit to an
independent investigator in cancer cachexia and muscle research."

Project Summary:
The Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) network project will establish the first comprehensive
public resource correlating genetic variation due to somatic mosaicism in human tissues from all development
layers in the human body. The SMaHT Network will have multiple centers to support the advancement of three
primary initiatives: 1) somatic variant discovery, 2) data analysis and network organization, and 3) technology
and tool development. The data from the SMaHT network project will provide an unparalleled research resource
for investigators to gain new insights on genetic variation due to somatic mosaicism processes in healthy human
tissues. In addition to capitalizing on new emerging methodologies to study somatic mosaicism in human tissues,
the SMaHT program includes an Ethical, Legal, Social Implications (ELSI) study to further our understanding of
the ELSI factors in human tissue donation for somatic mosaicism research.
To support the advancement of the SMaHT network project, this proposal will establish a Tissue Procurement
Center (TPC) that will provide the SMaHT network with multiple, high quality human tissue samples from the
same individual across all three developmental layers for their experimental analysis. To meet the challenges
for SMaHT network, our proposal is utilizing a multi-institutional effort with extensive expertise in human tissue
collection, research, pathology, imaging, biobanking, and ELSI study analysis. This span of expertise is essential
for the TPC to successfully deliver well-annotated, suitable tissue samples to support the generation of reliable
and reproducible results and data interpretations from the SMaHT network experimental procedures. In addition,
the TPC will lead the SMaHT network ELSI study to shed light on the ELSI-specific factors in human tissue
donation for somatic mosaicism research. To enable a more extensive analysis of these factors, the SMaHT
network ELSI study will include evaluations on Tissue Requesters (TRs) and Family Decision Makers (FDMs).
Collectively, our TPC team is committed to establishing an unequaled TPC for the SMaHT network program to
support the advancement of somatic mosaicism research, the associated ELSI factors, and ultimately the
development of new clinical approaches to treat disorders driven by genetic variations from somatic mosaicism
in human tissues.
Relevance:
The Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) network project will provide the first comprehensive
public resource of analyzing genetic variation due to somatic mosaicism in human tissues from all three
developmental layers. The SMaHT network program will create a new, state-of-the-art research resource to
support new discoveries in the biology and disease mechanisms that are propelled by somatic genomic
alterations in human tissues and facilitate the development of new clinical approaches for disorders derived from

Dental anxiety (DA) affects a striking 50-80% of adults and 6-22% of children. Individuals affected by DA often
exhibit disruptive behavior and avoidance of dental care, leading to major adverse health outcomes, including
increased rates of decay, pain, extractions, infections, emergent care and even hospitalization. DA frequently
develops in childhood due to traumatic experiences and can lead to lifelong DA. Behavioral management
techniques aimed at improving dental experiences must be employed during childhood to avoid these
sequelae. For patients with severe anxiety and decay, pharmacological interventions may be used. However,
sedatives and general anesthesia are frequently met with caregiver objections, as they carry low risks for
adverse events, including neurological injury and death. Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) with a trained therapy
dog has been used widely as a non-pharmacologic behavior guidance approach in numerous medical settings.
Though in its nascent stages in dentistry, the novel use of AAT in a pediatric population holds promise for
behavior management, reducing anxiety, mitigating pain, and creating positive associations. Furthermore, our
data from 800 patients and parents confirm a pervasive desire for canine AAT in dentistry. The objective of this
study is to evaluate whether AAT alleviates stress and improves perceptions during pediatric dental care. We
hypothesize that AAT significantly alleviates biometric and self-reported measures of anxiety and pain in
pediatric dental patients (with relative measure improvements of >20%). We propose to evaluate effects of
AAT on objective measures of stress and pain during preventative treatment using salivary stress hormones,
heart rate, sweat response, and observational coding data (Aim 1) along with patients' perceptions of dental
pain, anxiety, and future visits with validated questionnaires (Aim 2). As part of an ongoing randomized clinical
trial, data are collected from patients (age 4-7 years) randomized to a short AAT protocol, a long AAT protocol
and an active control with a dental exam and cleaning (N=180, 60 per group). Altogether, data generated from
these aims will be used to measure the impact of AAT on pediatric dental patients to guide implementation.
This secondary data analysis project will generate results on feasible, rapidly implementable protocols for AAT
use in dentistry to mitigate DA and improve experiences, to reduce dental avoidance and its significant health
sequelae. Our interdisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to conduct the proposed work as we have the
innovative methodologies, RCT patient data and samples, BLS2 facilities, and expertise to achieve our aims.
This application includes collaboration between experienced and junior faculty across multiple disciplines to
ensure the rigor and translatability of our findings."
10839481,"Project Summary
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections seen in the emergency department (ED)
and one of the most common reasons antibiotics are prescribed in the U.S. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing
and excessively long durations of therapy are two major causes of increasing antimicrobial resistance.
Standard treatment for patients discharged home from the ED is an oral course of antimicrobial therapy for a
set number of days. Physicians recommend that patients complete the full-course of antimicrobial therapy
regardless of the time of symptom resolution. However, this approach disregards host and pathogen factors
that affect an individual’s unique response to treatment. An alternative approach would be to direct a patient to
discontinue their antibiotics upon symptom resolution, i.e., patient-directed antimicrobial duration (PDAD). A
critical evidence gap is that a patient-centered approach has not been evaluated in clinical trials, but may
decrease unnecessary antibiotic exposure, lowering the risk of adverse events (AEs) and resistance
promotion, while resulting in similar outcomes as those treated with a standard approach.
Antimicrobial resistance has complicated UTI treatment with the prevalence of fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistant
Escherichia coli now exceeding 20% in some US locations. The Infectious Diseases Society of America
guidelines identified a research gap to understand the role of 3rd generation cephalosporins for outpatient
treatment of acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis (AUP) in the setting of high rates of FQ resistance. The need
for FQ alternative treatments is particularly pressing because of increasing reports of FQ-associated serious
adverse events (SAEs). A critical need exists to identify alternative antimicrobial strategies that could improve
patient outcomes and decrease the risk of AEs and resistance promotion. As opposed to short-course FQ
treatment, for β-lactam regimens, IDSA recommends a 10-14 day treatment duration, thus allowing an
opportunity to explore PDAD to minimize collateral antibiotic damage.
To overcome the inertia associated with the traditional recommendation to complete a full-course treatment
and demonstrate the safety and feasibility of conducting a large randomized controlled trial, we propose a pilot
study comparing PDAD to a fixed indication-specific duration using an oral 3rd generation cephalosporin for
women with AUP treated as outpatients. If our study hypothesis is confirmed, then results from a large clinical
trial will support a paradigm shift in the way antimicrobial therapy is prescribed for patients with AUP and other
common infectious diseases."

From early childhood, children need to develop views about when to help others and when to refrain. In
deciding whether to help, children often need to balance their personal concerns with their own interests
against their moral concerns with the interests of a recipient. Children who never help others may become
socially isolated, whereas children who always help others may be taken advantage of. Developing a
discerning prosociality is therefore key to healthy development. The preschool years is a transformative
period in prosocial development, when children’s household involvement increases in many communities
and when they become more able to reason about competing moral and personal considerations.
However, much prior research on prosocial development has examined stable individual differences,
seeking to identify characteristics of children who, on average, help more than others. In contrast, much
work on children’s moral reasoning and judgments has focused on situational variability—how children
judge helping as okay in some situations but not others—rather than stable individual differences. The
proposed research will test predictions of a model that incorporates insights from both of these research
traditions by examining how individual stability and situational variability in evaluative reasoning about
helping can explain stability and variability in prosocial behaviors. To explain how a discerning
prosociality develops, the proposed model also bridges a second tension in the field: that between
caregiver socialization and child autonomy. Research on caregiver socialization has often defined healthy
development as consisting of children adopting the values and practices of their caregivers. By contrast,
constructivist approaches have focused on how children scrutinize the values and practices of their
caregivers, accepting some and rejecting others. According to the integrative model tested by the
proposed research, children’s evaluative reasoning about helping develops through conversations with
caregivers, who can draw children’s attention to either personal or moral aspects of the helping situation.
To test key model predictions, the proposed research will involve naturalistic observations, structured
interviews, and storybook conversations. Through these activities, the project will assess caregiver-child
interactions around helping, as well as children’s prosocial reasoning, judgments, and actions in response
to both hypothetical and actual events. An ethnically diverse sample of 150 4- to 6-year-olds and their
families will be recruited to participate in one home visit and one virtual session. This initial study will
test predictions of the basic scientific model about how preschoolers develop prosociality through
reasoning. The findings will inform a larger intervention study aimed at leveraging everyday caregiver-
child conversations to strengthen children’s healthy prosociality."

The long-term goal of the study is to elucidate the mechanism(s) of the strain-dependent tau transmission and search for therapeutic targets to inhibit the transmission procedure. The central hypothesis is that the imprinted properties of tau strain impair neuron biology via transmission activities.

Our specific aims are to test the following hypotheses: (Aim 1) amyloid β plaques pathology interact with different forms of tau pathology and modulate of tau transmission; (Aim 2) the conversion of pathological conformations is the molecular basis of tau strain-dependent pathogenicity; (Aim 3) novel genes modulating tau transmission can be targeted as therapeutic strategies for tauopathy. This contribution is significant since the study will elucidate the molecular basis of the diversity of tauopathy and provide specific strategies to treat the diseases.

 This project aims at integrating computational modeling and innovative measurement technologies to
understand the complexity of single-cell aging and the emergent dynamics from the underlying regulatory
networks. Aging is closely associated with many diseases, such cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative
diseases. Advances in understanding the basic biology of aging will facilitate the development of new
interventional strategies to mitigate age-related diseases and prolong human healthspan. Although studies in
model organisms have identified many genes and factors that influence lifespan in eukaryotes, emerging
challenges are to understand how these genes and factors interact and operate dynamically to drive the aging
process and to determine the lifespan. During the previous funding period, our multidisciplinary team, using
microfluidic and imaging technologies combined with computational modeling, discovered that isogenic yeast
cells age with two distinct forms: one with decreased ribosomal DNA (rDNA) silencing and nucleolar decline
(Mode 1) whereas the other with heme depletion and mitochondrial decline (Mode 2). We further identified a
core molecular circuit, consisting of the lysine deacetylase Sir2 and the heme-activated protein (HAP)
transcriptional complex, that governs the fate decision toward one of the aging paths in single cells. Building
upon these results, for the next funding period, we will investigate the age-dependent dynamics of the energy
homeostasis and protein homeostasis systems, two conserved aging hallmark pathways in eukaryotes, and their
interactions with the Sir2-HAP fate-decision circuit. In Aim 1, we will quantitatively characterize the interactions
between aging and the energy homeostasis system and develop a model that simulates the aging dynamics of
the system. In Aim 2, we will quantitatively characterize the interactions between aging and the protein
homeostasis system and develop a dynamic model of proteostasis in aging based on the data collected. In Aim
3, we will combine experiments with modeling to characterize, simulate, and predict single-cell aging trajectories
and lifespan under complex environmental conditions, with a combination of different nutrients and stresses. The
proposed research will advance a quantitative and predictive understanding of regulatory networks underlying
single-cell aging under complex environmental conditions, laying the foundation for interventional strategies for
ameliorating age-related diseases and promoting longevity."

African American (AA) men have the highest incidence and mortality rate from prostate cancer (PCa) in the
United States. Prostate multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can sensitively
detect prostate tumors by integrating anatomical and functional information. The current standardized scheme
for interpreting mpMRI is the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS). However, detecting
cancerous lesions currently does not account for racially associated MRI characteristics in PI-RADS.
Our preliminary data showed a significant difference in detecting clinically significant PCa (csPCa) between AA
and CA men using PI-RADS when the tumors are in the transition zone (67% vs. 80%, respectively, p=0.026).
In addition, there was a distinctive difference in the PCa perfusion (that is, Ktrans) between AA and CA men, when
measured by quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (qDCE). When PI-RADS-based interpretation was
combined with the Ktrans threshold value specified for AA men, the csPCa detection rate in the transition zone in
AA men was improved to 76%, becoming not statistically different from that in CA men (p=0.180).
We developed a point-of-care portable perfusion phantom named P4 to improve the reproducibility of qDCE
measurement across different institutes. The P4-based error correction significantly reduced the variability in
qDCE measurement across three MRI scanners in two institutes and improved the specificity of Ktrans for csPCa
detection from 86% to 93%. We hypothesize that the racial disparity in PCa diagnosis can be reduced by using
racially associated qDCE measurement after P4-based error correction.
We propose to test this hypothesis in a multi-institutional setting at the University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). Our team will collect and link clinical, radiologic,
and histopathologic information using patient-specific 3D-printed prostate molds, software registration, and
expert annotation before and after radical prostatectomy. The highly curated radiology-pathology dataset will be
used (1) to characterize the qDCE measurement associated with tumor microenvironment in AA and CA groups,
using co-localized quantitative radiology-pathology analyses after P4-based error correction, (2) to investigate
whether the racially associated MRI-based tissue characterization improves the detection of aggressive PCa,
and (3) to develop the race/ethnicity-specific deep learning model for the improved detection of aggressive PCa.
When the Aims are successfully accomplished, the improved detection of PCa in both AA and CA men is
anticipated, compared to conventional strategies, reducing the racial disparity in detecting aggressive PCa."

The remarkable regenerative potential of the liver in young mammals is due to the ability of quiescent
hepatocytes to nimbly respond to mitogenic signals. This relies on a well-coordinated gene regulatory
program, which we propose is embedded in the hepatic epigenome. The epigenome serves dual roles in
regulating gene expression and in protecting cells from the threat of transposable elements (TEs), which if
unleashed can cause DNA damage and genomic instability. A complex combination of epigenetic marks
organizes the genome into regions (i.e. chromatin states) which dictate which regions stay open and which
stay closed. Closed chromatin states encompass silenced genes and most TEs. Open chromatin states
contain actively transcribed genes as well as genes held in a poised configuration in anticipation of signals
that alter their expression to change cellular function or identity. We discovered that genes that promote
liver regeneration are poised in quiescent livers, with repressive (H3K27me3) and activating (H3K4me3)
marks. Since H3K27me3 was lost on these genes during regeneration, we conclude this is a key element of
the epigenetic code that confers regenerative potential to young livers. We uncovered a surprising flexibility
in this code through studying the epigenetic regulator, UHRF1, which is essential for maintaining DNA
methylation during DNA replication. We found that Uhrf1 loss in hepatocytes (Uhrf1HepKO) resulted in global
DNA hypomethylation, but did not activate TEs. We attributed this to epigenetic compensation by
H3K27me3, which became enriched on hypomethylated TEs and depleted from promoters in Uhrf1HepKO
mice, with a concomitant premature activation of pro-regenerative genes and accelerated liver regeneration
in these mice. Our central hypothesis is that the youthful epigenetic code permits transcription factor
access to pro-regenerative genes while restricting access to TEs, and that this code is rewritten
during aging, resulting in TE activation and regenerative decline. We further hypothesize that UHRF1 and
H3K27me3 are key elements of this code. To test this, we will identify the molecular mechanisms of
epigenetic compensation in young Uhrf1HepKO livers and will examine the role of H3K27me3 in pro-
regenerative genes regulation in wild type livers (Aim 1). By Integrating epigenomic and transcriptomic
profiling of aged mouse and human livers compared to chromatin states in young livers, we will establish
how aging repatterns the hepatic epigenome to repress pro-regenerative genes and activate TEs (Aim 2).
In Aim 3, we explore whether depleting H3K27me3 can rejuvenate the liver. Together, the outcomes of this
work will uncover how the dual roles of the epigenome – gene regulation and suppression of transposon
threat – are integrated in regulating liver regeneration in young mice and will provide a foundation to
manipulate the epigenome to augment regenerative potential in the elderly and those suffering from liver
failure."

a-Thalassemia (a-thal) is caused by insufficient production of the a-globin protein due to either deletional or non-
deletional mutations of endogenous a-globin genes. In patients with severe a-thal (no or minimal synthesis of a-
globin chains), a blood transfusion independent-state is achievable through allogeneic bone marrow
transplantation, but this approach is limited to only some patients and is plagued by potential serious adverse
effects, such as graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease. No mouse models of severe a-thal are available to
study this disease and to test new therapies. Our proposed work will address these knowledge gaps by
developing, characterizing, and validating mouse models and gene therapy vectors for treating severe a-thal.
We hypothesize that new mouse models of a-thal will define the basic mechanism that governs RBC synthesis
in the presence of excess ß-globin chains and how it affects erythropoiesis, iron metabolism and coagulation. In
our first aim we will characterize these features in novel mouse models of severe a-thalassemia. As preliminary
studies, we generated adult animals that do not produce a-globin chains (AG-KO) through transplantation of both
AG-KO fetal liver and conditional AG-cKO hematopoietic stem cells into wild-type recipient mice. These animals
demonstrate a worsening phenotype, with red blood cells (RBC) that express only b-globin chains. Due to severe
limitation of these RBC to deliver oxygen, the mice eventually succumb to a condition resembling hypoxemia,
showing splenomegaly, liver and kidney iron deposition, and vaso-occlusive events. We are now generating
animals that only express one copy of the a-globin gene to characterize this disease in the context of minimal
synthesis of a-globin chains. Most of the patients affected by a-thal carry large deletions of the a-globin genes.
These deletions represent a serious challenge for gene therapy approaches based on genome editing.
Therefore, we hypothesize that severe a-thal can be safely rescued by gene addition. In our second aim we will
fully validate lentiviral vectors carrying the a-globin gene for their safety and ability to reverse the most severe
forms of a-thal. We identified ALS20aI, in which a-globin is under control of the ß-globin promoter and its locus
control region, as the most efficient vector. One copy of ALS20αI yields exogenous a-globin at a level
comparable to that produced by one endogenous a-globin gene. Indeed, ALS20aI rescues animals generated
with AG-KO fetal liver or conditional AG-cKO hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that a relatively low vector
copy number could result in dramatic therapeutic benefits. We will test ALS20aI or its derivatives for their ability
to express the safest and highest level of a-globin in mouse hematopoietic stem cells and human-derived
erythroid cell lines that synthesize low or no a-globin chains. We will then evaluate the constructs for their ability
to rescue the abnormal features observed in a-thal patient cells. Thus, the goals of this study are to develop
novel adult mouse models of a-thal and an effective gene therapy approach for this disease."

Epilepsy affects about 1% of people, and one-third of cases do not respond effectively to drug treatment.
Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy are candidates for surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone, a
potentially curative treatment. Clinical functional MRI plays a critical role in planning for neurosurgery in
epilepsy. FMRI provides data to localize eloquent cortex, to assess the risks and benefits of a planned surgical
resection, and to allow a resection to be tailored to the individual patient. The primary challenge to acquiring
high quality functional MRI is motion of the participant. Motion reduces the temporal signal-to-noise ratio
(tSNR) by misaligning the BOLD signal, motion creates spin history artifact, and motion can move parts of the
brain out of the imaging field of view. These artifacts in turn lead to both false positive and false negative
detections of functional activity, which compromise the fidelity of functional localization. This is usually detected
and corrected to the extent possible, by discarding motion corrupted data, and using only motion-free
segments. Since sufﬁcient data must be acquired for such an analysis, fMRI acquisitions are designed to
acquire redundant data to allow for loss to motion. At our institution, and others, this additional imaging time
alone has been estimated to more than double the cost of fMRI imaging studies. The loss of fidelity and
increased cost due to motion compromises the utility of the fMRI in planning for surgery. This is especially
critical in patients who have difficulty following instructions, such as elderly, ill, or pediatric subjects. There is an
unmet need for improved motion monitoring, prospective and retrospective correction for motion for fMRI. To
improve the utility and decrease the cost of fMRI, we propose to develop, apply and evaluate novel technology
to enable real-time self-navigated motion monitoring and improved correction for fMRI, through the following
four specific aims: Aim 1: Develop and evaluate reduction of motion enabled by real-time slice-by-slice motion
monitoring during fMRI; Aim 2: Develop and evaluate the reduction of motion artifact from slice by slice
retrospective motion correction; Aim 3: Develop and evaluate the reduction of motion artifact from real-time
slice by slice prospective motion correction (PMC); Aim 4: Assess the utility of motion monitoring, retrospective
motion correction and prospective motion correction for improving functional MRI for planning for epilepsy
surgery."
10836011,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preemptive use of antivirals (PET) to control cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia in hematopoietic cell transplant
recipients (HCT-R) was a therapeutic advance balanced by elevated toxicity. Newer drugs such as letermovir
(Prevymis) have lower toxicity with increased efficacy. FDA approval of Prevymis was for 100 consecutive days
(d) of prophylaxis which reduced CMV reactivation by ~2fold in high and low risk HCT-R. The antiviral effect
waned after 18 weeks without a survival benefit. We co-developed with NCI, a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA)
vaccine named Triplex expressing CMV immunodominant antigens. We published a safety study in healthy
volunteers showing strong immunogenicity of the vaccine (NCT1941056), which preceded a published
successful placebo-controlled and randomized Phase 2 trial (NCT2506933) of CMV-positive (P) HCT-R with
either CMV-Positive (CMV-P) or CMV-Negative (CMV-N) HCT donors (HCT-D). The Phase 2 trial met its primary
endpoint of reduced CMV reactivation in the vaccine arm by 50% with accelerated reconstitution of protective
CMV immunity. Triplex outcomes can be improved; one approach is to vaccinate the immunocompetent HCT-D
as demonstrated by our impressive preliminary results from an ongoing pilot study (NCT3560752) which showed
that all HCT-R (N=12) receiving stem cells from vaccinated matched related donors (MRD) were protected from
requiring PET. We hypothesize that Triplex injection of HCT-D will initiate protective immunity by transfer of
expanded CMV-protective T cells as a component of the stem cell infusion to the HCT-R, preceding dosing with
Prevymis, thereby eliminating its need. In Aim 1, we propose a Phase 2 randomized placebo-control trial (in
centers not prescribing Prevymis for MRD-HCT) with eligibility of CMV-P HCT-R with MRD (intermediate risk)
undergoing T-cell replete HCT for hematologic malignancy. CMV-P HCT-R will be randomized to receive stem
cells from HCT-D receiving a single injection of Triplex or placebo identical to the pilot trial. This trial will show
that a single HCT-D vaccination is sufficient to replace 100d of Prevymis to prevent PET usage in MRD-HCT-R.
In the 180d trial period we will assess PET usage, measure CMV-specific CD8/CD4 T cells with the goal of
associating frequency, memory phenotype, and gene expression with protection against reactivation leading to
viremia or disease. To extend Triplex benefit to haploidentical HCT-R treated with post-HCT cyclophosphamide
(PTCY) who are at high risk for CMV reactivation, in Aim 2 we propose a two-stage (Phase 1b/2) trial to choose
an optimal Triplex vaccine strategy that promotes effective immune reconstitution with minimal CMV reactivation.
All HCT-D will be vaccinated once with Triplex, and all HCT-R will be boosted with 3 Triplex injections on d28,
56, and 100. The initial open-label Phase 1b segment will either have patients abstain from Prevymis, or given
21d-100d of prophylaxis. The vaccination regimen with the least usage of Prevymis that still results in no increase
in reactivation compared to standard Prevymis will be selected for follow-on randomized Phase 2 segment of
vaccination with reduced or no Prevymis dosing compared to standard of care Prevymis with no vaccination."

Liquid biopsy modalities that can non-invasively detect disease-associated biomarkers from biofluids can enable
early cancer detection and patient monitoring with implications for improved survival rates. However, current
methods have not achieved critical sensitivity and accuracy to be approved for population screening programs.
New spectrochemical liquid biopsy methods, such as Raman and infrared spectroscopy, coupled with machine
learning models are emerging as next-generation diagnostic modalities. Yet, fundamental physical limitations of
light-matter interactions using conventional optical setups hinder the analytical performance of molecular
spectroscopy techniques. Here, we propose to employ novel electromagnetic metasurfaces that can advance
the analytical sensitivity and chemical selectivity of infrared absorption spectroscopy enabling its real-world
applications in the biomedical field. Moreover, our innovative laser-based spectral imaging approach can achieve
on-chip spectrometer-less chemical fingerprint retrieval eliminating clinically incompatible, complex, and bulky
instrumentation requirements.
The long-term goal of this project is to develop a rapid, label-free, portable, and non-invasive cancer detection
platform based on sensitive and accurate chemometric liquid biopsy and machine learning-aided discrimination
modalities. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) determine a potent metasurface design that can
robustly extract chemical fingerprint information from a complex biosample matrix, (ii) identify optimized design
parameters for spectral imaging-based on-chip fingerprint retrieval (iii) establish measurement protocols and
data processing pipeline (iv) identify a machine learning model by which sensitive and accurate sample
discrimination can be achieved. In the short term, we will pursue two specific aims: 1) develop novel engineered
metasurfaces for sensitive and specific spectrochemical biofluid analysis and demonstrate spectrometer-less
on-chip chemical fingerprinting 2) Test and validate the platform using biofluids from an ovarian cancer patient
cohort and non-cancer controls. Our proposed approach is innovative because it catalyzes the state-of-the-art
laser-based infrared spectral imaging technology with powerful nanophotonic tools to enable its impact in
biomedical diagnostics and address an unmet medical need. In addition, the proposed interdisciplinary project
is significant because it is expected to develop a non-invasive and accessible health screening platform that can
ultimately impact the clinical management of cancer and the survival outcomes equitably among diverse
populations."

10906301,"Lacrimal gland (LG) is an exocrine tubuloacinar gland that secretes the aqueous layer of the tear film.
Any alteration in the quantity and/or quality of tears produced by LG can result in aqueous deficiency dry
eye disease (ADDE). ADDE is a chronic condition affecting millions of Americans, with symptoms ranging
from a dry itchiness to blurred vision and accompanied by an increased risk of eye infections. Regenerative
and stem cell therapies that target LG repair are now coming to the fore, however, our understanding of LG
stem and progenitor cell biology is still incomplete. Our previous experiments on progenitor cell
transplantation label retaining cell (LRC) analysis and cell lineage tracing with clonal analyses suggest adult
LG has reserve or extremely plastic progenitor cells especially in the Sox10+ cell lineage and that LG
progenitor may have a therapeutic role in ADDE. Our recent studies demonstrate that myoepithelial cells
(MECs) retained high level of plasticity and are able to differentiate into acinar cells upon LG injury or
transplantation. Moreover, genetic elimination of MECs in vivo showed that they are required for LG
progenitor and acinar cell function. We also showed that LG inflammation could be mediated by the
Pannexin-1 (Panx1) membrane channel glycoprotein - a key regulator of inflammasome assembly.
Inflammasomes are large intracellular multiprotein complexes that activate proinflammatory cytokines in
response to infection and tissue damage or chronic inflammation. Our study suggests that the epithelial
cells sense damage/inflammation and contribute to the inflammatory response by producing the pro-
inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 Beta(IL-1Beta) and IL-18. Moreover, we showed that blocking pannexin-1
(Panx1) or Caspase 4 in LG reduces pro-inflammatory cytokine release and improves transplanted cell
engraftment. In a new proposal we will study the molecular and cellular nature of LG progenitor and
surrounding differentiated cells in healthy and chronically inflamed LG. First we will evaluate the Sox10+
(MEC and acinar) lineage establishment in healthy and diseased LGs and investigate the role Sox10
expression in Krt5 expressing progenitors in establishment of the MEC lineage. Second, we will investigate
the role of inflammasome pathways in LG progenitor and other epithelial cell function and LG repair in SS
mouse models Third, we will use a combination of anti-inflammatory Panx1 pathways blocking therapies
and cell transplantation for LG repair. We expect to identify key mechanisms responsible for LG dysfunction.
Our analysis of inflammasome pathways may facilitate development of entirely new drug treatments for
ADDE. Our studies will also provide important enabling information for use of LG progenitor cells in cell
replacement therapy for dry eye diseases that have no effective treatment or cure."

11165575,"ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the US, and unlike many other tumor
types, there are no known effective therapies targeting dominant oncogenic drivers. Almost all CRCs have
mutations that activate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, but direct inhibition of β-catenin is difficult, and
blocking Wnt ligand activity leads to significant on-target bone toxicity. Thus, while targeting Wnt directly is
challenging, aberrant Wnt pathway activation may induce tumor-specific vulnerabilities that can be exploited for
CRC therapy. Using a genome-wide genetic screen, we found that Wnt activation induces profound
sensitization to therapeutic asparagine depletion using asparaginase in drug-resistant leukemias. This effect is
dependent on Wnt-induced inhibition of GSK3, but is independent of APC or β-catenin. Instead, asparaginase
sensitization is mediated by Wnt-induced inhibition of GSK3-dependent protein degradation, a catabolic source
of amino acids required for asparaginase resistance. CRC provides a unique context in which to test
predictions from our model, because these tumors almost all have mutations that activate Wnt/β-catenin, but
these can function either upstream or downstream of GSK3. Using human CRC cell lines and genetically
engineered mouse intestinal organoids, we found that asparaginase had little effect on CRCs with mutations of
the downstream Wnt factor APC, but was profoundly toxic to cases with R-spondin translocations, which
activate Wnt signaling via ligand-induced inhibition of GSK3, and thus inhibit GSK3-dependent protein
degradation. Importantly, this approach has little detectable toxicity to normal intestinal or epithelial cells. This
suggests that this approach has a potent therapeutic index that could transform clinical outcomes for the
thousands of patients who die of CRC every year, and a clinical trial based on these data is under
development. However, we do not understand key aspects of the biology underlying this RSPO/Wnt-induced
therapeutic vulnerability. Defining the precise molecular events that dictate RSPO/Wnt induced asparaginase
sensitivity is critical for prospectively identifying clinical responders, designing rational approaches to improve
therapeutic response, and overcoming treatment resistance. These knowledge gaps will be addressed in the
following Aims: 1) Determine how RSPO ligands induce sensitization to asparaginase. 2) Investigate the role
of GSK3α body formation as a cellular response to asparagine starvation. 3) Determine the role of oncogenic
KRAS and TP53 mutations in therapeutic response of RSPO fusion CRC to asparaginase. This proposal is
expected to provide fundamental insights into the amino acid starvation response and its impairment by
aberrant Wnt signaling, cellular processes fundamental to metazoan life whose molecular basis and
therapeutic exploitation remain poorly understood. Given our highly complementary expertise in asparaginase
biology and Wnt signaling, this MPI team is uniquely poised to translate these advances into highly innovative
therapeutic interventions."
10884302,"Spinal Muscular Atrophy is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by insufficient amounts of SMN protein.
SMA is caused by loss or mutation of the SMN1 gene and retention of the SMN2 gene. The SMN2 gene is a
modifier of phenotype where milder SMA cases having more copies of SMN2. Rarely SMA patients have a
missense mutation in the SMN1 gene. We can use these mutations and the protein domains they disrupt to
study the function of the SMN protein. We have shown that SMA missense mutations are not functional by
themselves but can function in the presence of some full-length wild-type SMN protein. Furthermore, we have
shown that N and C-terminal SMN missense mutations can complement each other and rescue snRNP assembly
in the complete absence of full-length wild-type SMN protein in mice. We have developed cell line that
conditionally removes functional SMN to allow us test SMN missense mutations in culture. We have also used
this cell line to test for suppressors of the SMNE134K mutation. We have identified a suppressor in the SmF
protein that fully restores snRNP assembly lost due to the SMN E134K mutation. We now have a system to
screen for suppressors of SMN missense mutations. In this proposal we will test the SmF suppressor we have
found in two different SMN E134K mouse models and determine if this mutation rescues the SMA phenotype
and survival of the SMA mouse. Thus, we can study the separate functions of SMN in snRNP assembly from
the function of SMN in the axon. We will screen for additional suppressors using other SMN patient derived
mutations to test other functional domains of SMN. We will investigate the role of SMN in the axon independent
of Sm assembly by introducing HuD and truncated forms of SMN into the SMA mice via scAAV9. We have
shown in cells that Smn exon2B is not required for cell survival. We will test scAAV9-Smn∆2 in SMA mice to
confirm this finding and rescue the SMA phenotype. Finally we will test the role of profilin in axonal function in
the SMA mouse using the SMNS230L mutation. Using genetic mutations we can dissect the functions of SMN
in splicing and in the axon to resolve the underlying mechanism by which reduced SMN protein causes SMA."

Abstract:
The rapidly increasing number of microbial genomes has revealed an enormous diversity of proteins without
any known function. We still know relatively little about over half the proteins encoded in a typical bacterial
genome, and traditional laboratory techniques are too time consuming to characterize even a small fraction of
the observable universe of proteins. This neglected ""dark proteome"" potentially contains many important
determinants of virulence, antibiotic resistance, and disease. Casting a light on the dark proteome is possible
through comparative genomics because proteins interacting across evolutionary timescales leave behind a
signature of coevolution that can be used to connect proteins of unknown function with proteins of known
function. This 'guilt-by-association' analysis helps to generate hypotheses about the cellular role of unexplored
proteins. Here, we develop novel methods for quantifying coevolutionary signals, and we apply these methods
to an unprecedently large collection of genomes spanning the microbial tree of life. This project will result in a
network of coevolving genes that we will make publicly accessible as a web tool for biomedical research. To
further harness the power of comparative genomics, we will develop and deploy web applications that provide
deeper insights into the universe of microbial proteins."

Vascular calcification is a hallmark of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction
and stroke, which are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world. Although coronary artery
calcification (CAC) is a strong independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the genetic determinants of
CAC and the molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification remain incompletely elucidated. In a multi-cohort
study with more than 22,000 participants, we identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the arylsulfatase E
(ARSE) locus that are associated with coronary artery calcification. In an in vitro model of calcification, our
preliminary experiments demonstrated that inhibition of ARSE or a related protein sulfatase 1 (SULF1)
prevented the calcification of coronary and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Furthermore, we
found that SULF1-deficient mice are protected from developing vascular calcification. Based on our preliminary
evidence, combining a human genome-wide association study, in vitro VSMC experiments, and an in vivo
murine model of vascular calcification, we have identified ARSE and SULF1 to be novel activators of vascular
calcification. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which these
sulfatases promote vascular calcification and atherosclerosis. First, using a series of VSMC functional assays,
we propose to determine the specific role of ARSE and SULF1 in promoting VSMC osteogenic phenotype
switch and calcification. We will also ascertain whether the sulfatases induce the development of vascular
calcification and atherosclerosis in vivo using mouse models. Second, we have uncovered an important role for
ARSE and SULF1 in regulating autophagy and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. We will
determine if the effects of ARSE and SULF1 on VSMC-mediated vascular calcification is dependent on their
effects on autophagy and/or BMP signaling. Lastly, we will examine the associations of the ARSE index variant
with a range of electronic health record phenotypes, as well as with additional vascular calcification
phenotypes including aortic calcium volume and density, aortic valve calcification and mitral annular
calcification. Furthermore, we will conduct the first genome-wide association study to identify novel genetic
determinants of coronary calcification density. The experiments proposed will provide important mechanistic
insights into the function of sulfatases in the vasculature and into the underlying molecular and genetic
mechanisms of vascular calcification and atherosclerosis."

Delirium has a devastating impact on older adults and their care partners. It is associated with in hospital
adverse events (e.g., falls), declines in physical and cognitive function, nursing home placement and increased
mortality. Despite its poor outcomes and high costs, < 50% of all delirium cases are detected in routine care.
To address this challenge, in READI (Researching Efficient Approaches to Delirium Identification) we
developed, validated, and field tested the Ultra-brief CAM (UB-CAM), a two-step delirium identification protocol
that combines an ultra-brief 2-item screen (UB-2) with a validated diagnostic tool (3D-CAM). We enrolled 527
patients, avg. age 80 years, 35% with ADRD, at 2 study hospitals, performed reference standard delirium
evaluations on 924 hospital days (153 with delirium), followed by blinded UB-CAM App-directed assessments
by physicians, registered nurses, and certified nursing assistants. The UB-CAM was feasible (97% completion
rate), brief (average 1 min 15 seconds), had overall accuracy of 89%, and performed well by all disciplines. We
found similar positive results in the enriched subset of READI participants with Alzheimer’s Disease and
Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). We simultaneously conducted qualitative research to
understand barriers and facilitators to implementation of delirium screening. While READI substantially
advanced the field, it did not test full scale implementation of screening among all hospitalized older adults.
We now propose to take this critical next step in READI-SET-GO (READI—Sustaining Effective Translation to
create Gero-Friendly Organizations) by integrating daily delirium screening using the UB-CAM into routine care
for every older adult admitted to 6 acute medical/surgical units at 3 hospitals in 2 states. We will conduct a
stepped-wedge implementation design, where UB-CAM screening will be launched at a new unit every 6
months over a 42-month study. We will utilize evidence-based implementation strategies and test fidelity,
accuracy, sustainability, and impact. Using a pragmatic cohort of 20,000 older adults, plus a nested patient-
oriented sample of 1050 older adults enriched for AD/ADRD, we propose the following Specific Aims,
 1. To test the fidelity, accuracy, and sustainability of integrating daily nurse screening for delirium
 using the UB-CAM into routine care for all hospitalized older adults.
2. To evaluate the impact of UB-CAM delirium screening on patient and care partner centered
 outcomes and perceptions of care assessed at one month follow-up interviews.
3. To evaluate the impact of UB-CAM screening on rates of delirium complications (falls, pressure
 injury, aspiration) and adverse delirium management (psychoactive medication, restraint use).
Findings from the proposed study will be readily adopted into clinical care and will directly inform best
practices for delirium screening, particularly for vulnerable older individuals with AD/ADRD. Our results have
the potential to make the hospital a safer place for older adults, improving outcomes and reducing distress."

data correlating TDP-43 inclusions with cognitive decline in AD patients. TDP-43 associated AD has been
termed as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) as well as other acronyms,
underlying the newly-recognized importance of TDP-43 in AD (AD-TDP). AD is the most common cause of
mid- to late-life cognitive impairment and dementia, afflicting ~30 million people worldwide Based on an
extensive review of clinical and pathological studies, TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with an amnestic
dementia syndrome that occurs in older adults. A statistical analysis of attributable risk suggests that TDP-43
associated AD is a major public health issue accounting for up to 20% of cases of clinically diagnosed AD
dementia. This TDP-43 proteinopathy is a distinct clinical and pathological entity from other TDP-43
associated diseases that may also be treatable with a TDP-43 targeted therapy, such as amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) and certain forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-TDP). Therefore, successful
completion of this project has the potential to identify TDP-43-based therapeutics for the treatment of other
diseases where TDP-43 plays a major and causative role. We have discovered small molecules that bind to
TDP-43 in such a way as to inhibit binding of RNA to TDP-43 and prevent TDP-43 aggregation, with activity
suggestive of a therapeutic effect in three models: (1) human wild-type and mutant TDP-43 expressed in
Drosophila, (2) induced motor neurons (iMNs) from C9orf72 patient-derived iPSCs, and (3) mice expressing
human TDP-43 (Thy1 promotor). Evidence from 2-D NMR studies and computational docking analysis
suggests that these inhibitors are binding to ribonucleotide recognition motif RRM2 which contains one of the
amino acids involved in a critical and functionally-relevant salt bridge with RRM1. A recent PET imaging study
describes a metabolic marker to potentially select AD-TDP patients for clinical trials based on ratios of FDG
imaging in different regions of the brain. In this project we seek to discover, validate and develop new small-
molecule inhibitors of nucleic acid binding to TDP-43 and TDP-43 aggregation inhibitors to treat AD-TDP. Aim
1 is the optimization of in vitro potency and drug-like properties of novel TDP-43 ligands including penetration
into the brain and acceptable half-life and safety measures using a comprehensive battery of pharmaceutical
industry-standard assays and criteria. Aim 2 involves target engagement studies using hTDP-43 transfected in
HEK293T cells, patient-derived induced motor neurons from iPSCs, dynamic light scattering analysis of
aggregation, and X-ray crystallography of ligands bound into TDP-43. Aim 3 is evaluation in animal models of
TDP-43 pathology, initially using a Thy1 promoter followed by a hTDP-43 based mouse model that
demonstrates cognitive impairment in the absence of locomotor deficits. Aim 4 includes IND-enabling studies,
scale-up synthesis, multi-species PK and rodent toxicity."

Kidney transplantation (KT) is a lifesaving intervention for the 10,000 people living with HIV (PLWH) and end-
stage renal disease in the United States. Confirmed as safe and effective in the early 2000s, this practice has
rapidly expanded in the past decade amid transformative antiviral advances for HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) as
well as passage of the HIV Organ Policy Equity (HOPE) Act permitting HIV-to-HIV transplantation. Despite the
complex nature of this vulnerable population, neither the landscape of serious infections nor an understanding
of optimal immunosuppression to balance infection and kidney rejection risk has been defined. It is critical to
understand this paradigm as infection causes >20% of early deaths following KT and rejection, which results in
immunosuppressive intensification and a more susceptible host, is 2-4-fold more common in HIV+ KT
recipients.
The goals of this proposal include characterizing the burden, timing, and spectrum of serious infections after
HIV+ KT with comparison to matched HIV- KT recipients to understand differential risks associated with
recipient HIV status (Aim 1). This will be accomplished through development of the largest cohort of HIV+ KT
recipients to date by linking the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients and the US Renal Data System,
which also incorporates Centers for Medicare and Medicaid claims data to ascertain serious infection events.
Pharmacy clearinghouse data will augment infection, rejection, and antimicrobial prophylaxis ascertainment.
Next, among the population of HIV+ KT recipients, a risk factor analysis will be performed with focus on
biological variables and immunosuppressive regimens associated with developing serious post-transplant
infections (Aim 2). The goal of this analysis is to inform targeted monitoring and prophylaxis to prevent
infectious complications in HIV+ KT recipients. Finally, the association of donor HIV status with serious
infection risk will be explored through the robust infrastructure of the ongoing HOPE in Action multicenter
clinical trials of HIV-to-HIV KT (NCT03500315, Aim 3). This analysis will incorporate rich data on HIV+ organ
donors and recipients including hitherto unexplored HIV biology and laboratory markers, in the context of
robust infection and rejection reporting.
Taken together, this proposal seeks to delineate the landscape of serious infection among PLWH undergoing
KT in the modern era using a comprehensive infection ascertainment schema and rigorous epidemiologic
methods. Ultimately, the goal is to advance understanding of infectious complications in this unique and
emerging group and drive evidence-based practices that improve long-term post-KT outcomes."
10883725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US, and
podocyte injury is a key event in DKD and primary glomerular diseases. In vitro and in vivo studies with
experimental mouse models demonstrated a protective role of retinoic acid (RA) against podocyte injury in
glomerular diseases, but these findings had not been validated in human studies. Leveraging the glomerular
transcriptomic datasets of human primary glomerular disease available from the Nephrotic Syndrome Study
Network Consortium (NEPTUNE), we recently identified retinoic acid receptor responder protein 1 (RARRES1)
as a gene whose expression was negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline
and associated with worsened renal outcomes in patients with primary glomerular disease, suggesting that
RARRES1 is a risk gene for human glomerular disease. Since RA signaling had been shown to be largely
renoprotective against podocyte injury in experimental CKD models, these results suggested that RA signaling in
vivo may in fact confer dichotomous cytoprotective (RARRES1-independent) and cytopathic (RARRES1-
dependent) effects in the regulation of podocyte homeostasis. Indeed, our in vitro and in vivo findings show that
increased podocyte RARRES1 expression leads to podocytopathy in mice, whereas decreased RARRES1
mitigates podocyte injury and disease progression in experimental mouse model of FSGS. Mechanistically, the
cleavage of membrane-bound RARRES1 in its extracellular domain into a soluble form (sRARRES1) and its
subsequent endocytic uptake is required for RARRES1-mediated podocyte apoptosis. These results indicate a
critical role of RARRES1-mediated podocyte injury in glomerular disease, which were recently published in JCI
[Chen et al. 2020, PMID: 32634130]. Expanding on these results, we further posit that RARRES1 is a key
pathogenic inducer of podocyte loss and DKD progression. Since RARRES1 cleavage is critical for the podocyte
apoptosis in vivo, a better understanding of RARRES1 cleavage mechanism can be translated therapeutically to
attenuate podocyte loss in DKD, and ii) since sRARRES1 levels increase in the plasma and urine of DKD patients,
plasma and urinary sRARRES1 may serve as a prognostic biomarker of DKD progression. Therefore, in this
application we propose to 1) examine the mechanism of RARRES1 cleavage and its role in kidney cell injury in
vitro; 2) Examine the contribution of RARRES1 in DKD pathogenesis in vivo; and 3) Examine whether the
sRARRES1 detection can be utilized as a prognostic biomarker for future incidence or progression of DKD,
leveraging two cohorts (ISMMS BioMe biobank and ACCORD). Moreover, this proposal will address the current
knowledge gap on the dichotomous role of RA in podocyte homeostasis."
10844637,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Enhanced training in infectious disease-related research is critical for the generation of new knowledge that
can be applied to the treatment and prevention of clinical problems. In this long-standing training program,
Molecular Basis of Infectious Diseases (MBID), we focus on the development of microbiologists with the
skills to advance our understanding of molecular biology, microbiology, bacterial and fungal pathogens, and
host-microbe interactions, and the ability to recognize opportunities for translation of that information into
clinical applications. The purpose of the MBID T32 is to 1) provide an optimal environment for training new
scientists in the latest concepts and techniques in microbiological research; 2) enhance the understanding
among young scientists of current challenges in clinical infectious diseases; and 3) teach critical thinking skills
that prepare students for research careers in which they contribute to and influence research efforts that lead
to effective solutions for important infectious disease problems. The 21 diverse faculty members participating in
the renewal of this predoctoral training grant are from five partner and neighboring institutions: University of
Texas Health Science Center at Houston, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Rice
University and Institute of Biosciences and Technology of Texas A&M University. Our faculty have a record of
high research productivity, extensive collaborations, investigator-initiated NIH funding, and graduate student
and postdoctoral fellow training. They have mentored 80 predoctoral trainees during the past ten years, and
currently are mentoring 47 PhD students. The training program includes a core curriculum that draws upon
relevant courses at participating institutions, intensive and interactive research experiences, monthly MBID
meetings, annual retreats, weekly seminars and journal clubs, career and professional development activities,
interaction with underrepresented summer undergraduate students, and participation in infectious disease
grand rounds. The MBID faculty have a strong track record in the recruitment, training, and career
advancement of underrepresented groups. For the next grant period, enhancement of the successful MBID
predoctoral training with an improved curriculum, additional training faculty, and the addition of a predoc–
postdoc mentoring program are proposed. The training program will undergo regular evaluations by external
experts and adjustments made to the program as needed. MBID takes advantage of the strong research and
mentoring expertise of its faculty and the educational activities already in place and to leverage all the available
resources to train the next generation of scientists focused on tackling pressing infectious disease and public
health issues. The highly collaborative environment provides the perfect opportunity for trainees to acquire the
skills, expertise and intellectual abilities to foster innovative research and prepare them for careers in which
they contribute to effective solutions for important infectious disease problems."
10929980,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory arthritis with a prevalence of around 0.6%
in the general population and is a common chronic autoimmune disease in the veteran population. RA patients
suffer greater mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases. This increased burden is in part related to the
immune derangements of RA itself, and some of it is attributable to the immunosuppressive therapies that are
used to treat RA.
 Herpes Zoster (HZ) reactivation is the most common opportunistic infection of treated RA patients and
is about double that of the general population. HZ already has a lifetime risk of 20-30% in the general
population. Until the recent approval of a recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV, brand name Shingrix) there was
only the live attenuated vaccine, Zostavax. It was infrequently used in RA patients on treatment due to its
contraindication in immunosuppressed individuals as it is a live virus vaccine. RZV being a subunit vaccine
does not have this limitation. In addition, RZV has been found in the general adult population to be highly
efficacious (>90%) even in persons over age 80. This has resulted in a significant potential opportunity to
protect RA patients even on immunosuppressive therapy.
 Immune protection from HZ is much different than immunity to primary varicella zoster (VZV) infection
(chickenpox) which is primarily antibody-mediated. Work from an innovative primate model of HZ suggests
that cell-mediated immunity (CMI), specifically by CD4+ T cells, is a key for protection. All of the vaccines
previously studied in RA patients have been ones that elicit protection through antibody-mediated mechanisms
and not CMI. The effect of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on vaccine immunogenicity or
efficacy, in particular focused on RZV elicitation of CMI is not known. The proposed study is therefore
innovative, in that they propose to determine the effect of RA and DMARD treatment on the immunogenicity of
RZV. Analysis of response to RZV in RA patients proposed in this study has direct clinical relevance and
translational potential. It may influence the choices of DMARDs to be utilized as there are many options for
treating RA. It could provide data that supports a clinical trial using drug windowing where the treatment with
DMARD is withheld transiently after vaccination to improve the response.
 They hypothesize that RZV will have a reduced immunogenicity in RA patients compared to
non-RA controls and that RA patients on anti-metabolite synthetic DMARDs will have reduced
immunogenicity more than those on biologic DMARDs such as TNFi.
 They will perform a laboratory blinded observational study of 100 RA patients, the overwhelming
majority of whom are on DMARDs, and 100 age-matched non-rheumatology subjects to determine the
difference in immunogenicity of RZV between these populations.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. To determine the magnitude and differential effects of synthetic and biologic
DMARD therapies on the immunogenicity of RZV in RA patients.
Aim 2 To determine the mechanistic pathways of both reduced and robust vaccine specific responses
to RZV using systems biology approaches and to determine the signatures that is associated with
these responses in RA patients on DMARDS.
Aim 3. To compare adverse event profile of RZV vaccination in RA patients to age-matched non-
rheumatic disease individuals."
10930812,"Humans are highly social beings that are motivated to seek out, engage in, and maintain interpersonal
relationships with others. This fundamental human drive is referred to as social motivation. However, Veterans
with schizophrenia often experience disruptions in social motivation, resulting in poor social functioning.
Current evidence-based treatments are not sufficiently effective at improving impairments in social motivation
in Veterans with schizophrenia. To inform novel treatment development, new experimental approaches are
needed that will generate a more complete understanding of this pervasive problem. The current proposal
adapts a theoretical framework of social motivation from the National Institutes of Health (NIMH) Research
Domain Criteria (RDoC), which parses social motivation into two major components: social attention and social
memory. Social attention refers to the bias to preferentially attend to social aspects of the environment, and
involves stages of attention capture and sustained attention. Social memory refers to the ability to remember
who we interacted with to establish and maintain relationships, and involves stages of memory encoding and
retrieval. It is not clear the stage at which social motivation impairments begin to emerge for Veterans with
schizophrenia. Additionally, the relative contribution of these two social motivation components on social
functioning is not known. Social functioning in schizophrenia has traditionally been assessed using clinician-
rated interviews, which has limited specificity in understanding the complexities of real-world social functioning.
The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate the relative contribution of the two social motivation
components (social attention and social memory) and their specific stages of processing on real-world social
functioning in Veterans with schizophrenia. The proposal utilizes an innovative multi-modal approach that
elucidates stages of processing with electroencephalography (EEG), and real-world social functioning with
digital phenotyping via smartphone technology. The results of this study have the potential to advance our
understanding of social motivation in schizophrenia and to identify specific treatment targets that will reduce
the cost and burden associated with this debilitating disorder at the VA.
In addition to addressing the above research goals, this Career Development Award (CDA) will provide the
applicant, Lauren T. Catalano, PhD, with the training in the areas of: (1) translational research in the social
neuroscience of schizophrenia and social motivation; (2) advanced electroencephalography (EEG) techniques;
and (3) digital phenotyping via mobile smartphone technology. The applicant’s career goal is to become a VA-
based psychology clinician researcher, working to improve the social disability experienced by Veterans with
serious mental illness. The training outlined in this CDA application will lay the groundwork for the applicant to
develop an independent research program within the VA focused on social motivation in schizophrenia. The
VISN 22 Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Center (MIRECC) at the VA Greater Los Angeles
Healthcare System (GLA), and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) provides an excellent
environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed study. The primary mentor will be Michael F. Green,
PhD, the Director of the VISN 22 MIRECC Treatment Unit, Director of the VA Research Enhancement Award
Program (REAP) for Enhancing Community Integration in Homeless Veterans, and an established researcher
in the field of schizophrenia. The applicant will also receive specialized training from an expert in EEG
methodology in Veterans with serious mental illness (Jonathan K. Wynn, PhD), and a leading expert in mobile
assessment methodology in Veterans with serious mental illness (Eric L. Granholm, PhD)."
10889104,"California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (CPP), the lead institution for this grant, is partnering with the
University of California, Riverside (UCR), the RO1 institution, in a Bridges Master’s of Science (MS) to the
Doctorate Program (2021-2025). The overall program goal is to increase the number of MS students from
underrepresented minority (URM) racial and ethnic groups, low socio-economic backgrounds and those with
disabilities successfully transitioning to PhD programs in biomedical research. There will be 4 Cohorts of 6 MS
students per year (24 students total). Each student will have a CPP Faculty Research Mentor (FRM), a UCR
FRM, a CPP Faculty Advisor (FA) and a UCR FA. Bridges students will have 2 years to complete their MS
research project at CPP, participate in research-related skills at both institutions, take a UCR course and conduct
a 10-week summer research internship at UCR. The grant objectives will be: a) students complete MS programs,
are accepted and make a successful transition to a PhD program; b) students increase research knowledge and
skills needed to become biomedical independent researchers; c) students increase confidence in preparedness
for PhD programs; d) students deepen awareness of biomedical careers; e) CPP-UCR partnership creates an
integrated support system, faculty development, and networking for students to succeed in PhD programs. Short
term outcomes will be: 1) completion of doctoral program within 5 years; 2) presentation and publication of their
research; 3) CPP expands STEM research collaborations with UCR, other RO1 institutions and STEM industries;
4) increase CPP and UCR support of URM students through research opportunities, and post-doctoral positions.
Long term outcomes will be: 1) Bridges support system is integrated and sustained at CPP and UCR; 2) STEM
careers are supported by students’ families; 3) gaps closed in preparation and professional representation of
diverse groups in STEM research; 4) barriers of difference removed to create an inclusive STEM community.
Each student will be matched and integrated into CPP FRM and UCR FRM labs, present research findings,
attend seminars, journal clubs, workshops and scientific conferences at both institutions. To enhance faculty
mentoring, the CPP and UCR faculty will participate in professional development workshops and, since most
faculty have limited industry experience while a majority of the new PhDs enter industrial positions, faculty will
be encouraged to do a 4-6 week residency in industry. In addition to student panel discussions, Bridges students
will be paired with CPP MS alumni or UCR PhD predoctoral candidates to provide near-peer mentoring.
Leveraging these activities will build student confidence, communication skills, scientific ethical behavior, STEM
networking and awareness of future career opportunities. Sense of community will expand further by inviting
students’ families to program socials at the beginning, middle and end of the program to engage family. By
nurturing a sense of community amongst the Bridges students, their mentors, and their families, the students will
have a strong support network to help them complete a PhD and have a successful STEM career."
10874724,"Administrative Core – Project Summary
 The Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (WF ADRC) provides a comprehensive, integrated
infrastructure to facilitate research aimed at identifying the causes of AD, and elucidating the role of
vascular/metabolic factors in transitions from normal aging to AD and other dementias. The WF ADRC also
provides resources to better understand disease heterogeneity and the multi-faceted impact of health
disparities on AD risk. The Administrative Core ensures that ADRC scientific and programmatic goals are
achieved by providing visionary oversight and effective governance to all Center activities, and scientific
direction to the Center as a whole. The Core will be directed by an Executive Committee, whose members
include the Director, Associate Directors, Core and Service Leaders, and the Program Manager. The
Executive Committee will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) composed of institutional
leaders who meet regularly to facilitate the achievement of ADRC aims and promote the growth of AD
research at WF. The Core will be also guided by an External Advisory Committee (EAC), chosen in
consultation with the NIA and consisting of members of other ADRCs and scientific leaders. The EAC will
meet annually to review WF ADRC program goals and progress. We will also seek input about ADRC
engagement with our community and participants through our Community and Participant Advisory Boards.
 Expansion of AD-related research and impactful utilization of valuable scientific resources are important
goals for all ADRCs. The Administrative Core Committee for Resource Utilization and Research EXpansion
(CRUX) oversees a coordinated series of activities to ensure that ADRC resources contribute to high-impact
research and that new translational scientists are brought into the field. In the past cycle, the CRUX facilitated
the rapid and successful integration of our new ADRC into the larger ADRC network, providing data and
biospecimen resources to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), the National Centralized
Repository for AD (NCRAD), other ADRCs and AD investigators world-wide. Through its distinctive theme and
innovative phenotyping, our ADRC contributes to National Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) Research
Milestones involving metabolic/vascular factors, health disparities, translational models and trial design.
 WF ADRC’s ability to achieve its scientific and educational mission depends on the efficacy of its
Administrative Core. In its inaugural cycle, Core leaders developed and led vigorous interdisciplinary research
and educational programs. We have established effective Executive and Internal Advisory Committees,
launched a successful pilot program that has drawn creative new investigators to AD research, and established
multiple high-impact collaborations. Our comprehensive activities to date demonstrate that Administrative Core
members have the vision, influence, and commitment to ensure the far-reaching success of the WF ADRC."
10874729,"Clinical Core – Project Summary
 The Clinical Core (CC) is the centerpiece of the Wake Forest Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center
(WF ADRC), providing rigorously collected and innovative resources to advance the ADRC themes: to
elucidate the factors influencing the transitions from normal aging to MCI and dementia, with special
emphasis on understanding the role of vascular and metabolic conditions and health disparities in
these transitions. Although in existence for only four years, the CC has surpassed its original enrollment
target of 500 participants. As of August 2020, we enrolled 583 participants (20% from underrepresented
groups), contributed 1135 UDS3 evaluations and 555 MRI images to NACC, and 295 samples to NCRAD. The
CC has also contributed 256 well-characterized participants to clinical studies. Consonant with the WF ADRC
focus on early transitions, the cohort is weighted toward cognitively normal adults and participants with MCI,
with a smaller number of participants with AD, mixed AD/vascular or other dementias. All participants have
been carefully characterized with the UDS3 and MRI, and with specialized metabolic and vascular measures.
Many participants have also undergone lumbar puncture, amyloid or tau PET, and mitochondrial analysis. In
the coming cycle, we will increase the CC cohort size to follow 600 participants and will introduce a panel of
innovative biometric measures relating to sleep, physical activity, glucose metabolism, and vascular function.
 The CC cohort is well-suited to address WF ADRC themes and provide resources that will
contribute to greater understanding of the influence of metabolic/vascular factors and health
disparities on ADRD risk. Approximately 70% of CC participants have glucose intolerance or hypertension,
as expected given high regional prevalence of these disorders. To facilitate research on the role of health
disparities in AD risk, we will work with the Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core to maximize
engagement with underrepresented groups. Our CC will also align with the WF Older Adults Independence
Center (OAIC) to facilitate studies on the role of aging in AD. Further, CC investigators will participate in an
innovative program to foster alignment of large cohort studies with ADRC practices through the Clinical
HArmonization and IMPlementation Service (CHAMPS). WF CHAMPS led the development and piloting of the
UDS3 Telephone/Video Cognitive Battery provided to ADRCs when in-person research was restricted due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. In summary, our CC has made exceptional progress in its first 4 years; it has
enrolled 583 participants, contributed copious resources to the ADRC network, and provided a foundation for
the explosive growth of ADRD research at Wake Forest. In the next cycle, we will leverage this success to
further promote high-impact research on strategies for prevention and treatment of AD and related disorders."
10874732,"Data Management and Statistical Core – Project Summary
The mission of the Data Management and Statistical Core (DMSC) is to promote excellence in the Wake
Forest ADRC by providing outstanding data management, biomedical computing, and analytical support to
ADRC investigators and affiliates. The Wake Forest ADRC has four overarching aims: 1) to establish a
comprehensive integrated research infrastructure at Wake Forest focused on identifying the causes of
Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD) and potential strategies for prevention and treatment; 2) to
develop within this infrastructure specialized resources to facilitate research on the role of metabolic and
vascular pathways in AD pathogenesis and on targeted development of therapeutic strategies; 3) to optimize
the participation of African American adults in research and educational programs to better understand and
treat the causes underlying the increased risk of ADRD in these individuals; and 4) to provide education
regarding ADRD to researchers, health professionals, patients and their families, and the community at large.
To accomplish these objectives, the DMSC will: 1) provide and maintain state-of-the-art resources for data
management, study management, and reporting to ensure the highest data quality and study integrity and to
increase the efficiency and impact of ADRC research; 2) provide expertise and collaboration in study design,
clinical trials, biostatistics and other analytical sciences (including measurement, image analysis, modelling,
statistical genetics, bioinformatics, and biomathematics) for Wake Forest ADRC-affiliated projects; 3) develop
and maintain efficient and secure platforms for the exchange of data within the Wake Forest ADRC and with
NACC, NCRAD, other ADRCs, and ADRD researchers; 4) mine our extensive library of data from major
studies of cognition and AD to facilitate efficient study design, provide a platform for pooled analyses, and
provide resources to facilitate the development of ADRD researchers, and 5) provide a bridge between ADRD
and gerontology/geroscience researchers in the ADRC and the Pepper Older American Independence Center
(OAIC) to leverage existing expertise and resources and nurture novel approaches. The DMSC has a breadth
of relevant experience, a diverse analytical team, a strong collaborative environment, many extant resources
for study management, an extensive archive of cognitive data from many major studies, and a proven robust
data management infrastructure. These are the essential facets and notable strengths of our ADRC."
10874735,"Neuropathology Core – Project Summary
 The Neuropathology (NP) Core will provide unique resources to support the Wake Forest Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Center (ADRC) focus on transitions from normal aging to MCI, AD, and related disorders,
and the role of metabolic and vascular risk pathways in these transitions. The Core will foster innovative
research in all areas relevant to AD. To accomplish these goals, the Core will provide state-of-the-art
collection, storage, and distribution of brain and other biospecimens, establish neuropathological diagnoses of
decedent Clinical Core (CC) participants, and provide resources and expertise for non-human primate (NHP)
models for pivotal mechanistic and therapeutic research. The NP Core will also contribute to the ADRC theme
of health disparities with a unique program focused on increasing brain donation from underrepresented
groups (URGs). Through these activities, the NP Core will make impactful contributions to many National
Alzheimer’s Project Act (NAPA) Research Milestones, such as supporting deep, longitudinal molecular
endophenotyping of cohorts that include URGs (1A), data and sample sharing (3A, 4D), and development of
the next generation of animal models (4A, B, C).
 The NP Core currently maintains a biospecimen repository of DNA, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
from >1,100 well-characterized participants from the ADRC and its affiliated studies. In the coming cycle, we
will continue to archive biospecimens from ADRC CC participants who have received careful metabolic and
vascular characterization. DNA, CSF and blood will be provided to NCRAD, other consortia, and individual
investigators. AD CSF biomarkers (Ab40, Ab42, tau, and p-tau181) are rigorously measured on all participants
who undergo lumbar puncture (LP), and special expertise is available for blood and CSF biomarkers of
metabolic and vascular disease. We continually assess scientific advances in identifying novel blood and CSF
biomarkers of ADRD and will implement these as the field evolves. Further, human protocols for brain, blood
and CSF collection have been applied to NHP models, creating a unique resource with which the AD research
community can conduct pivotal translational research. In the past cycle, we demonstrated that our NHP model
has neuropathologic changes similar to early AD such as amyloid plaques, AD-like CSF Ab42 profiles, cerebral
hypometabolism, and reduced brain volumes. Consultation about NHP and other models (rodent, organoid) will
be available.
 In summary, through careful clinico-pathologic analysis of well characterized cohorts, unique biospecimen
repositories, and novel translational models, the NP Core will promote the WF ADRC themes, and provide an
exceptional resource to investigate underlying mechanisms, novel biomarkers, and therapeutic targets that
impact progression from normal aging to MCI and ADRD."
10874739,"Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core – Project Summary
The Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core serves as the essential liaison between the ADRC
and the community on which it depends for support and participation in ADRD research. A key educational
theme for the Core’s community outreach program is the effect of metabolic disease and other vascular risk
factors on ADRD onset and progression. In our first cycle of funding, ORE Core efforts led to the enrollment of
583 participants into the Clinical Core, and representation by racial/ethnic underrepresented groups increased
from 14% in Year 1 to 20% in Years 3 and 4 – a testament to the strong foundation laid by our early
engagement work particularly in the African American community. For the next cycle, the ORE Core has four
primary objectives. First, we will develop and deliver new innovative outreach programs to continue to recruit
and enroll a diverse cohort of research participants that includes individuals from underrepresented
racial/ethnic groups, individuals at increased risk for cognitive decline and dementia due to metabolic and
vascular factors, and adults with ADRD. Second, we will engage and retain African Americans in ADRC
research activities through continued delivery of an established multi-pronged outreach program that provides
education, access to resources, and community service; through development of new engagement and
education programs focused on brain health, the importance of brain donation, and caregiving education and
support; and through new retention programs for Clinical Core participants. Third, we will provide educational
programs for health care professionals and the public about early signs, progression, prevention and treatment
of cognitive impairment, AD. Finally, we will contribute to the ADRC network by sharing recruitment and
education materials developed for minority communities, training modules for staff focused on cultural
sensitivity, and metrics from ORE Core programs to inform ADRC priorities in recruitment."
10874740,"Imaging Biomarker Core – Project Summary
The Imaging Biomarker Core (IBC) of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) at Wake Forest
School of Medicine will address a critical need to establish biomarkers that reliably differentiate Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) from other conditions that affect cognition in aging. Recently, an AD research framework was
developed for a biologically-based classification to enhance identification of disease mechanisms, to
appropriately target therapeutic interventions, and to track therapeutic response and disease progression.
Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure structural changes and
positron emission tomography (PET) to track changes in pathological hallmarks such as beta-amyloid and tau,
comprise a powerful approach to characterize the progressive pathology associated with cognitive decline and
to differentiate AD from other dementias. To establish reliable biomarkers associated with AD and other
conditions that impair cognition with aging will require a large collaborative effort and the national ADRC
network is ideally suited to address this need. The Wake Forest ADRC can make unique contributions to the
network. The IBC will conduct longitudinal, multimodal neuroimaging paired with phenotypic and genomic
characterization of a diverse cohort of participants. The IBC will provide expertise and resources to
complement the ADRC’s themes that focus on: 1) early transitions from normal aging to mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and AD; 2) the role of metabolic and vascular risk in these transitions; and 3) the nature of
these relationships in persons from underrepresented groups (URGs). The first aim of the IBC will be to
leverage the Clinical Core and extensive existing Wake Forest imaging infrastructure, including research-
dedicated PET and MRI, cyclotron, and advanced analytic pipelines, to conduct state-of-the-art longitudinal
imaging to help identify the causes of AD and develop novel strategies for prevention and treatment. As a
second aim, the IBC will integrate imaging data with clinical, biomarker, and other research data to facilitate
scientific discovery. The third aim will be to develop imaging methods for animal models of AD, and the final
aim will be to provide training and consultation on the latest scientific advances in neuroimaging to ADRC-
affiliated investigators and trainees. Through these aims, the Wake Forest ADRC IBC will further the
understanding of AD pathology and its relationship to cognitive decline and will significantly enhance the
Center’s contribution to the ADRC network and to investigators worldwide."
10874743,"Research Education Component – Project Summary
The Research Education Component will collaborate with other ADRC Cores and affiliate members to provide
critical training and education to build a pipeline of new investigators from diverse backgrounds and with the
necessary research interests and skills to meaningfully contribute to ADRD research – particularly with regard
to metabolic and vascular risk factors underlying ADRD pathogenesis. In the last 4 years, we supported
training of 20 graduate students and 8 postdoctoral fellows, and intensive mentoring for 17 junior faculty – 70%
of whom now serve as Principal Investigators on 22 NIH or foundation ADRD grants. In the next cycle, REC
programs will continue to leverage unique strengths and resources of the institution and the ADRC, particularly
with regard to our experiences conducting ADRD translational research – from cellular mechanisms through
rodent and nonhuman primate models to large-scale multi-site clinical studies. The REC Scholars Program will
provide individualized and comprehensive training to junior investigators with clinical or basic science expertise
to facilitate expansion of their work to support key concepts in translational science that could be instrumental
in identifying effective strategies for ADRD prevention and treatment. The REC will also develop and deliver an
extensive portfolio of ADRD-related educational programming for undergraduates, graduate students, fellows,
and investigators from other disciplines to further expand the new investigator pipeline through ADRC
interactions with Pepper OAIC, CTSI and other institutional programs. Given Wake Forest’s well-known and
successful history conducting large multi-site clinical studies in older adults, a focus of the REC training
program will include Team Science to provide new investigators with the skills to ensure successful project
management, development of strong and sustainable collaborations, and effective leadership of
multidisciplinary teams. Such teams will be essential for scientific discovery targeting prevention and treatment
of ADRDs, which are characteristically heterogeneous in clinical presentation, etiology, and pathologic
trajectory."
10929935,"ABSTRACT
Prolonged sedation treatment is currently considered standard practice in the safe and compassionate care of
critically ill neonates and infants despite leading to opioid tolerance and a high incidence (35-57%) of physical
dependence. A unique cohort of infants with congenital long-gap esophageal atresia (EA) undergoes complex
perioperative critical care necessitating extraordinarily prolonged sedation (on the scale of weeks). Although our
group recently reported decreased brain size and delayed brain growth in term-born infants following long-gap
EA repair with prolonged postoperative sedation, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of (i) underlying
mechanisms and (ii) long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Guided by strong preliminary data, this proposal will address 3 key gaps in our knowledge: (1) timing of brain
findings (pre vs. during perioperative repair); (2) regional specificity (gray vs. white matter) of (mal)adaptations;
as well as (3) infant brain and clinical correlates to early neurodevelopmental outcomes at 1-year of age. The
study will employ structural MRI techniques to address these aims. Selected term-born and premature infants
with short-gap (brief pain/sedation treatment) and long-gap EA (prolonged sedation treatment) will be scanned
twice (AIM 1): before (as neonates), and after complex perioperative critical care (at 4(±1) months of age). Early
neurodevelopmental outcomes will be evaluated using standard approaches (AIM 2).
The findings will inform (I) mechanisms of brain (mal)adaptations associated with delayed vs. abnormal brain
development in infants exposed to prolonged sedation; (II) identify early diagnostic and prognostic indicators for
longitudinal neurocognitive correlates; and (III) inform future development of neonatal/infant therapies to mitigate
the neurological effects in vulnerable infants exposed to prolonged sedation. Our application aligns with the goals
of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and National Institute of Drug Abuse
(NIDA) to improve the lives of children throughout all stages of development. We established the feasibility
serving critical data collection, and we assembled an interdisciplinary team of experts for its successful
completion. This research is innovative in that it encompasses a selected group of term-born infants exposed
to prolonged sedation associated with dependence to drugs of sedation; novel in that it will investigate underlying

10809723,"ABSTRACT
 Systemic therapies for advanced stage cancer use immune checkpoint inhibitors to exploit patient's own
immune system to generate a robust anti-tumor immune response. This approach is successfully applied for
melanoma and lung cancer, but is less effective for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. Since most HCC
patients are diagnosed at intermediate or advanced stages when curative treatment options are limited, a novel
immunotherapy driven treatment is highly desirable.
 The acidity of the tumor microenvironment driven by hyperglycolytic tumor metabolism represents a key
mechanism of resistance and contribute to immune cell exhaustion, thereby helping cancer cells evade the local
immune response. Our hypothesis is that tumors responding to immunotherapies have detectable features like
normalization of tumor acidity and higher density of immune cells. These parameters, if measured together, can
help predict which patients will respond to immunotherapy and/or understand why some patients do not. Imaging
extracellular pH (pHe) of tumors along with assessing local immune cell recruitment is necessary to better monitor
and guide liver cancer immunotherapies. However, to accurately co-localize the pHe information with the immune
cells, high spatial resolution pHe imaging is needed. The goal of this proposal is to establish high resolution
in vivo pHe imaging in mouse liver to investigate the effect of cryoablation on tumor aggressiveness in
relation to recruitment of local immune cells.
 In Aim 1 we will establish and validate a high resolution pHe imaging technique in mouse liver using a
multidrug resistance gene 2 knockout (Mdr2 KO) model of HCC on a cirrhotic background, where the chronic-
inflammation-fibrosis mimics the important stages of liver injury seen in humans. Since repeated freezing of a
tumor triggers release of antigens for an anti-tumor immune response, in Aim 2 we will determine if cryoablation
can modulate the state of tumor's immunogenicity. Thus, cryoablation may provide an in situ immune system
amplification instrument by converting an aggressive immuno-suppressive tumor into a more immuno-permissive
tumor. The working hypothesis is that MRI-guided cryoablation will raise pHe by killing tumor cells, and will
modulate tumor's degree of immunogenicity by releasing antigens. To investigate the effects of cryoablation,
high resolution pHe images will be acquired in Mdr2 KO mice livers 1 day before and 7 days after cryoablation.
We will use mice with multiple liver tumors and cryoablate only one to investigate both target and distal effects.
Histopathology will be used to reveal intratumoral immune cell recruitment of activated T-cells, helper T-cells,
effector T-cells, phagocytes and M2 macrophages. If successful, this approach will allow future investigations of
synergistic anti-tumor effects achieved by combining cryoablation with immune checkpoint inhibitors for improved
immunotherapeutic effects."
10885120,"The goal of this proposal is to study how perturbation in three-dimensional (3D) genome folding alters CD4+ T
cell function, mediating allergic disorders. T cell identity depends on not only the linear genome sequence that
embeds millions of regulatory elements, but also the 3D chromatin architecture that orchestrates the spatial
localization of the regulatory elements with their target genes. Recent advances in our understanding of
nuclear organization indicate that single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with immune-mediated diseases
may impact gene regulation through altered 3D genomic structure and reorganization of large genomic regions
in the disease relevant cell types. However, the link between sequence variation, cellular context, 3D genome
folding, and aberrant gene expression in majority of immune-mediated complex diseases remains largely
unknown. Our objective is to determine the molecular processes through which 3D genome
organization in T cells is linked to allergic disorders. We formulated this objective based on four
unexpected observations: (A) Our algorithmic definition of groups of densely interacting multi-enhancer
elements, which we called 3D cliques, revealed that a locus harboring the Ets1 and Fli1 genes is
hyperconnected in T cells. (B) This unique 3D genome architecture is conserved in human T cells coinciding
with multiple polymorphisms associated to type 2 immune diseases including allergy, asthma, and atopic
dermatitis. (C) We generated a novel strain of mice by deleting a non-coding sequence homologous to the
allergy-associated polymorphic region in the human genome, ~250kbp downstream of the Ets1 promoter. This
genetic deletion left T cell development intact but led to major defects in CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) differentiation.
Th1 cells are responsible for the control of intracellular pathogens such as bacteria and dampen Th2
responses to allergens. Hence, limited Th1 differentiation due to genetic modification of the Ets1-Fli1 3D clique
may cause allergic responses. (D) We modeled the type 2 immune responses in vivo using house dust mites.
In the lung tissues of mice with a deletion in the non-coding sequence in the Ets1-Fli1 3D clique, we detected a
dramatic increase in allergic responses characterized by a significant accumulation of eosinophils and Th2
cells and a reduction in Th1 cells. These unpublished data provide us with compelling evidence that our
engineered mouse strain is a model for understanding the role of noncoding regulatory elements and 3D
genome folding in type 2 immune diseases. However, detailed cellular and molecular mechanisms through
which genetic deletion in the Ets1-Fli1 locus causes overt allergic responses remain to be understood.
Moreover, the generalizability of our 3D clique analysis to additional pathogenic regulatory nodes remains to
be examined. This work is significant because it is the first-ever mechanistic investigation providing a
connection between genome architecture and type 2 immune diseases."

Post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) is a painful, debilitating and expensive joint disease that conservatively
impacts 5.6 million people at any time in the United States. Currently available clinical treatments are mostly
palliative and fail to suppress cartilage degeneration or synovial inflammation or to promote tissue regeneration.
Consequently, osteoarthritis progresses to an end-stage disease where total joint replacement is the only
answer. Our aim is to provide an injectable solution for the treatment of PTOA, through the fabrication of super-
lubricious microspheres loaded with platelet-rich plasma (PRP), which is blood plasma that has been spun down
to concentrate the platelet component. These platelets contain more than 300 bioactive molecules that play
critical roles in controlling and resolving inflammation, while also stimulating cells within the joint to proliferate
and regenerate tissues such as articular cartilage. Unfortunately, direct injection of PRP into the knee joint has
shown inconsistent efficacy in the clinic, mainly because the harsh environment within the osteoarthritic knee
rapidly breaks down and destroys the bioactive molecules rendering them useless for therapeutic effect.
Therefore, we propose to fabricate lubricious injectable polyethylene glycol (PEG) microspheres for injection into
the intra-articular knee space that cannot be cleared by the body with the synovial fluid turnover. We will evaluate
the incorporation and release as well as bioactivity and immunotoxicity of PRP from the hydrogel system, through
both quantification of specific proteins released over time and in vitro cellular response studies, respectively.
Finally, PRP-loaded microspheres will be used in a mouse model of knee injury and osteoarthritis to determine
the ability for our system to i) modify the intracapsular inflammatory state, ii) stop cartilage degeneration, iii)
promote new cartilage formation and, iii) restore joint homeostasis."
10659592,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) in humans results from infection with members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex
(MTBC). The disease is endemic in many parts of the world. So is bovine tuberculosis (bTB) - a well-recognized
zoonotic disease of bovine species (cattle and buffalo) also caused by infection with members of the MTBC.
India has the world’s highest TB burden in humans, with more than 2M new cases and 400,000 TB-related
deaths each year. India also hosts the largest bovine herd on the planet (~300M animals), and our recent studies
suggest that more than 22M of those animals may suffer from bTB. Yet the risk of zoonotic TB (zTB) resulting
from transmission of MTBC from bovines to humans in India and other high-TB burden settings is unknown. This
is a major knowledge gap, and elimination of TB will be considerably more difficult if there is spillover from a
domestic livestock reservoir to humans. This is of particular concern in countries such as India where the
frequent consumption of unpasteurized milk and close contact with infected animals likely present additional
elevated risks for zoonotic transmission. Because of this, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other
supranational organizations have developed a ""Roadmap for zoonotic TB"" that calls for the establishment of a
stronger evidence base to improve understanding of the burden and risk pathways of zTB to guide an effective
response. To fill these knowledge gaps, we propose studies with the overall objective of estimating the risk
associated with zTB in a high-TB-burden setting. We will accomplish this by applying rigorous quantitative risk
assessment augmented by state-of-the-art whole-genome sequence (WGS)-based molecular epidemiology
and multi-host transmission modeling. Performed at well-established study sites in Vellore and Tiruvallur districts
in Tamil Nadu, India, our Specific Aims are to: 1) Estimate the risk of human TB associated with exposure to
cattle, buffalo, or the consumption of raw milk in ~1,750 human cases and ~3,500 controls; 2) Apply WGS-based
approaches to define the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology and perform phylodynamic and
phylogeographic analysis of MTBC lineages circulating in human TB cases, sympatric cattle and buffalo, and
locally sourced raw milk; and 3) Perform multi-host transmission modeling to quantitatively assess zTB risk to
humans and the potential benefits of control. These studies involve the application of innovative and powerful
nested case-control epidemiological surveys with WGS-based genotyping and mathematical modeling. The
results of our studies will inform and refine estimates of zTB risk, enable identification of transmission chains at
a local scale, and transform our understanding of spillover and circulation of MTBC strains between human and
bovine hosts. In the long-term, our findings will provide sustained positive impact through the development of
evidence-based approaches to quantify and reduce risk of zTB in support of the global efforts to end TB."
10844390,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cells must regulate their genome so that genes are expressed in the appropriate cell type, and at the
correct time. Further, as cells go through the cell cycle chromosomes must be replicated, compacted and then
faithfully segregated. All these processes require correct folding of the genome. Defects in folding, e.g., the
looping of genes to incorrect distal enhancers, or incorrect chromosome compaction during mitosis, can lead to
genes being expressed in the wrong place and at the wrong time, or to genome instability. Such defects can
lead to diseases including cancer. There has been tremendous progress in identifying folding principles of
chromosomes, how folding changes during the cell cycle, roles of cis elements in folding chromosomes and
long-range gene regulation, and the molecular machines and mechanisms that fold chromosomes. In
interphase chromosomes fold into topologically associating domains and cohesin-mediated loops.
Chromosomes also compartmentalize to form active and inactive chromatin domains through a phase
separation process. In mitosis, chromosomes refold into linearly compressed arrays of condensin-mediated
loops. We and others showed that alternation of cohesin-mediated loop formation and condensin-mediated
loop formation drives cell cycle stage-dependent chromosome folding. However, three critical aspects of
chromosome organization have remained largely unexplored, mostly due to lack of experimental approaches.
First, little is known about the identity of cis elements that mediate interactions between sister chromatids, yet
these interactions are critical for faithful chromosome segregation. Second, the topological state of
chromosomes, i.e., the presence of intra- and inter-chromosomal catenations is almost entirely unexplored.
Catenations form during replication and transcription and these create impediments to correct gene expression
and chromosome segregation and therefore the cell must constantly resolve these. Cis elements and trans
factors involved in controlling the topological state of the genome are largely uncharacterized. Third, factors
and cis elements driving chromosome compartmentalization are poorly characterized. We recently developed
three new genomic technologies, SisterC, Multi-Contact 3C, and Liquid Chromatin Hi-C that allow studying
each of these three outstanding questions respectively. Here, we will employ these methods to identify
genomic DNA elements, and their mode of action, that control chromosome compartmentalization, catenation
and decatenation, and that play roles in disentangling and segregating sister chromatids."
10832114,"Abstract. Emerging cell-based therapies may greatly improve therapeutic success of cancer treatment. NK cell
immunotherapy is particularly important in treatment of pediatric cancers, where information on tumor
immunogens is lacking. Recently, there has been increased interest in the use of adoptive transfer of ex-vivo
expanded NK cells for the treatment of solid tumors due to their innate features, higher safety compared to T
cells and lower cost. This emerging therapy is of particular importance in osteosarcoma where 30-35% of patients
die of pulmonary metastases due to a treatment-failure rate of 85% in this patient group. However, an important
problem with implementation of cell therapies in the clinic is our inability to readily assess the presence and
distribution of therapeutic cells after administration. Visualization of immune cell distribution and migration with
non-invasive imaging could offer significant new insight into the progression of immunotherapy between infusion
and invasive biopsy or resection. Although there are a number of viable approaches for imaging of
immunotherapy, all current strategies have limitations and no technology has been proven as a single solution
for longitudinal imaging of cellular immunotherapies. Therefore, it is important to continue pushing the limits of
available imaging tools in order to find solutions that would address the pressing clinical needs. Hyperpolarized
(HP) 129Xe MRI has recently emerged as a promising modality for direct imaging of respiratory function and gas
absorption. Spectral separation between HP 129Xe gas in the airspace, tissue/plasma, and red blood cells permits
quantification of gas absorption and exchange. Further, a few exploratory studies have demonstrated that
chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) of HP 129Xe in perfluorocarbon nanodroplets (PFC NDs) can
significantly enhance sensitivity to the presence of PFC ND’s due to a strong chemical shift between 129Xe gas
in PFC and water. We see these developments as a tremendous opportunity to develop clinically translatable
strategy for imaging NK cell therapy in the lungs. Here we propose to develop foundation for HP 129Xe CEST
(hyperCEST) MRI of NK cells in vivo. The secondary goal is identification of imaging biomarkers of functional
HP 129Xe MRI that may provide additional insight into response to cell immunotherapy. We will rely on our
extensive expertise in (i) synthesis and applications of PFC NDs in biomedical imaging including cell labeling,
and (ii) quantitative MRI, multinuclear imaging (13C, 19F, 129Xe) and metabolic imaging. Our hypothesis is that
labeling of NK cells with PFC NDs optimized for 129Xe hyperCEST MRI will not adversely affect their functionality
and will allow non-invasive NK cell monitoring with high sensitivity and specificity in the lungs. At the completion
of these studies we will have a combination of optimized and validated probes for NK cell 129Xe hyperCEST MRI
with corresponding imaging protocols that will provide foundation for further development of this promising
technology towards clinical translation."
10894788,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Autism is a lifelong developmental disability affecting 1 in 44 people, characterized by challenges in social
communication and social interaction and restricted repetitive patterns of thinking or behavior. Autistic young
adults (AYAs) experience social challenges, particularly in dating and sexual relationships, that place them at
high risk for depression, anxiety, suicide, and sexual victimization compared to non-autistic young adults. To
compensate for social challenges, AYAs often try to “camouflage” autism by replacing autistic traits with
learned behaviors that mirror those of non-autistics. Adoption of these non-autistic behaviors is often
encouraged in existing sexual educational programs for AYAs, which aim to decrease the outward presentation
of autistic traits by teaching AYAs to “pass” as non-autistic. While camouflaging may minimize social alienation,
it comes at a high cost, often contributing to depression, loss of identity, and suicide. These serious outcomes
point to a pressing need for interventions to support AYAs in developing social skills that allow them to respond
to social challenges without hiding autistic traits. Further, little is known about what social challenges related to
dating and sexual relationships AYAs want to learn about in sexual education.
Using a participatory research approach, in which autistic self-advocates are members of the research team,
the objective of this project is to develop an educational program with and for AYAs – a program that provides
strategies for managing social challenges that AYAs identify as impacting dating relationships while also
validating and normalizing their natural responses to social situations. Specific aims include: 1) to identify
social challenges in dating from the perspective of AYAs; 2) to determine which social challenges in dating that
AYAs identify as most problematic for themselves; and 3) to develop a sex education program to help AYAs
manage dating social challenges.
Qualitative content analysis of interviews with AYAs (30-50 participants, 18-30 years) about social challenges
they face in dating (Aim 1) will inform the development of a survey for a different larger group of AYAs (150-
175 participants) to identify the highest priority concerns for sexual education from their own perspectives (Aim
2). A sexual education program to address those top priority social challenges will be developed (Aim 3), which
will include scenarios of dating social challenges, non-camouflaging ways that AYAs may respond to them, and
likely consequences of their responses. Our long-term goal is to provide AYAs with education about strategies
for managing social challenges in dating that help them to make social decisions that make sense to them and
that decrease their risks for poor mental health outcomes and sexual victimization."
10909197,"Clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis states are symptomatic, dynamic periods that occur before
psychosis onset and are subjects of intensive research. The focus on CHR is driven by evidence of behavioral
and brain level impairments in many individuals experiencing their attenuated psychotic symptoms which are
similar to those found in first episode and chronic schizophrenia (SZ): our work, and that of others, demonstrated
that CHR individuals show deficits in both brain function and cognition reminiscent of those found in SZ. For
example, increased default mode network (DMN) connectivity found in SZ was also identified in CHR. The CHR
period offers the most hope for mitigating or preventing disease development yet effective treatment options are
still lacking.
 The overarching goal of this R61/33 study is early efficacy testing of the real-time functional MRI-based
neurofeedback (rt-NFB), aided by mindfulness (rt-NFB+M), to impact both brain connectivity and clinical and
neurocognitive (NP) outcomes. In the R61 phase, we will examine the efficacy of rt-NFB+M targeting the DMN
to reduce medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortex (MPFC-PCC) hyperconnectivity and to increase
MPFC-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) anti-correlations in CHR subjects who will be randomly assigned
to either real-rt-NFB+M (N=24) or sham/control -rt-NFB+M (N=24) condition. Thirty healthy controls scanned
once will serve as an additional control group. Neurotransmitters in MPFC and DLPFC will also be assessed
using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to relate cellular level measures to brain network measures. MPFC-
PCC connectivity reductions and MPFC-DLPFC increased anticorrelation, post-NFB, in the real rt-NFB+M
group, will be the R61 GO criteria. In the R33 phase, we will replicate R61 results in an independent sample
of 51 CHR in the real-fMRI NFB+M condition, compare the effects of rt-NFB+M (N=51 CHR) versus meditation
only (N=30 CHR), examine dose-response over 4 sessions, and the relationship between network connectivity
and glutamate (Glu) and GABA changes, as well as clinical and neuropsychological changes, especially in
working memory (WM) and attention, post-intervention, in both rt-NFB+M and in the meditation only group. This
proposal builds on our successful use of rt-NFB in SZ to modulate the DMN connectivity and mitigate symptoms.
As one of the first in the field, we demonstrated that rt-NFB targeting the DMN reduced its hyper-connectivity in
SZ which; in turn, was associated with auditory hallucinations reduction after rt-NFB. Increased MPFC-DLPFC
anticorrelations were also observed and associated with increases in MPFC GABA in a separate study.
Furthermore, we have observed that increases in DMN-DLPFC anticorrelations due to pharmacological or
behavioral interventions are associated with improved WM and attention. Since our preliminary data suggest that
SZ with the least abnormal brain patterns benefited most from our rt-NFB intervention, we believe that adopting
the rt-NFB in CHR will be highly effective in altering the disease trajectory."
10799650,"Despite the impressive response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in the clinic as an anti-cancer
treatment, it is not curative. Even the most potent kinase inhibitors are ineffective against a small
population of cancer cells, which are insensitive to treatment; manifesting as minimal residual disease
(MRD). Likewise, myeloproliferative disorders treated with Jak2 inhibitors show intrinsic resistance to
TKI treatment . Failure eradicate the persistent cells them leads to post-therapy relapse. Therapeutic
response to TKI is mediated by oncogene-addiction; however, the molecular mechanisms governing
TKI-induced cell death in the context of oncogene-addiction is not clearly understood. We find that
MAPK phosphatase, Dusp1, is a critical mediator of oncogene-addiction in MPD driven by mutations in
JAK2, MPL and CSF3R. Overexpression of Dusp1 in MPDs abrogates oncogene addiction and ablates
TKI response. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Dusp1 is synthetic lethal to Jak2-V761F
and CSF3R-T618I driven MPDs. The proposed research will address the sensitivity of murine-model
of MPD leukemia initiating cells and primary patient specimens to disrupting Dusp1 activity alone and
in the context of TKI therapy. In addition, we propose to develop specific and potent Dusp1 inhibitor
using structure function studies for clinical application. Our results should accelerate development of
a curative therapy for MPDs."

Older dialysis patients commonly have geriatric syndromes which contribute to increased healthcare utilization
and poor quality of life. Currently, identification and management of geriatric syndromes are not included in
dialysis care. Adding geriatric syndrome management into routine care for dialysis patients could result in
significant improvements in quality of life and healthcare utilization. Barriers to integration of geriatric evaluation
and management into dialysis clinics (e.g., time, personnel, costs) can be minimized through the development
of innovative geriatric care models that leverage the existing dialysis unit interprofessional team and workflow.
We will pilot a new dialysis care model that includes a centralized geriatric team that uses information from the
Geriatric screen for OLder Dialysis patients (GOLD) to develop individualized recommendations for geriatric
syndrome management based on the patient’s priorities. The GOLD is a self-administered screening battery of
validated instruments to screen for a range of geriatric syndromes (cognitive impairment, depression, falls,
mobility disability, social support needs, and malnutrition). The multidisciplinary dialysis team will integrate the
recommendations into their care plans with support from the centralized geriatric team. Ultimately, this geriatric
care model could be seamlessly integrated into dialysis clinic structure. The objective of this application is to
optimize the care model with key stakeholder input and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
obtain evidence critical to inform a definitive RCT. We propose three aims: 1) iteratively refine GOLD to achieve
acceptable agreement with a geriatrician evaluation, 2) iteratively refine the geriatric care model to ensure
acceptability and feasibility to key stakeholders, and 3) conduct a pilot RCT (n=100) to evaluate the geriatric care
model’s impact on geriatric syndrome management and inform design of a larger RCT. For Aim 1, we will have
participants complete the GOLD and undergo geriatric evaluation. We will assess agreement of each GOLD
instrument with its corresponding geriatric evaluation, and if target agreement is not achieved, we will iteratively
modify and re-test the GOLD instrument. For Aim 2, we will refine the care model using experience-based co-
design with a stakeholder advisory board and multiple phases of feedback from study participants. After patients
complete the care model, these patients and their dialysis clinicians will assess acceptability and feasibility of
the care model through surveys and interviews. The care model will be iteratively refined until specific metrics of
success are achieved. For Aim 3, patients will be randomized to receive the geriatric care model or usual care;
geriatric syndrome management measured by patient report and chart abstraction will be compared at 3 months.
We will also assess patient reported outcomes, physical function, and health care utilization at intervals up to 12
months to assess their adequacy for inclusion as outcomes in a subsequent definitive RCT. Upon completion,
we will have key preliminary data for a large RCT testing a novel dialysis geriatric care model. Overall, this
application will address the significant problem of geriatric syndromes in the older dialysis population."

Cancer mortality is higher in areas of the US affected by Persistent Poverty (PP) compared to areas in which
poverty has not persisted for decades, especially for obesity-related cancers like breast, prostate, and colorectal
cancer. While reasons may be multifaceted, the role of social determinants of health (SDH) cannot be
overlooked, including aspects of the Living Environments (e.g., physical and social) and their “downstream”
effects on behaviors that impact health promotion and increase cancer risk and mortality. In 2021, Alabama
ranked 8th in the US for poverty. The state includes some of the most impoverished inner-city and rural
communities in the nation, and thus a considerable number of both urban and rural Census Tracts (CTs)
identified as PP areas by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The overall goal of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB) Center for Cancer Control in Persistent Poverty Areas (C3P2) is to reduce the burden of
cancer and cancer disparities in PP areas by expanding research and research capacity through
implementation and evaluation of multilevel interventions to improve cancer outcomes across the cancer control
continuum from prevention to survivorship. The C3P2 goal will be achieved through: 1) Establishment and
support of two transdisciplinary, multi-level, multi-domain research projects to adapt, implement, and evaluate
multilevel interventions across the cancer control continuum from prevention to survivorship, as well as pilot
projects through a Developmental Core; 2) Establishment of a coordinated C3P2 infrastructure to support and
strengthen the C3P2 research agenda by: a) providing overall integrated management and comprehensive
evaluation, b) providing common research resources and measures to promote project integration and
collaboration (Administrative and Research and Methods Cores); 3) Development of a pipeline of investigators
for cancer control research in PP areas by providing training, support, and research experience opportunity to
early career investigators (Career Enhancement Core); 4) Academic-community partnership building with
establishment of a Community Advisory Board and engagement of Community COaCHes to support innovative
and salient research in the community, and monitoring and evaluation to ensure achievement of proposed
goals. (Administrative Core). Our multi-disciplinary team of established and early career investigators, working
in a supportive environment with the resources and commitment to address and challenges in PP areas to
cancer prevention and control, are well positioned to make an impact in PP communities of Alabama and
improve cancer outcomes. The C3P2 will serve as a model to improve cancer prevention and control for other
PP areas in Alabama and other states."

Maintaining mitochondrial integrity is necessary for normal eukaryotic physiology and, not surprisingly,
mitochondrial dysfunction is a pathological hallmark of diseases and has been implicated as a primary risk factor
for many cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. Critical to mitochondrial function is its dual-membrane
architecture which provides appropriate microenvironments that facilitate specific metabolic functions – such as
oxidative phosphorylation – and allow for otherwise incompatible processes to occur simultaneously inside the
cell. Traditionally, research on mitochondria have focused on bioenergetics, but recent studies have begun to
shed light on the intricacies and complexities of the mitochondrial proteome and the biogenesis machineries.
This is particularly important as >99% of the mitochondrial proteome (~1500 proteins in humans) are encoded
by nuclear genes and synthesized by cytosolic ribosomes as precursor proteins (preproteins). These preproteins
contain endogenous signals that target them to mitochondria, where they are subsequently translocated across
the outer membrane, sorted, compartmentalized, and properly folded by three main protein import machineries:
the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex, the mitochondrial translocase of the inner
membrane (TIM)-23 complex (TIM23), and the TIM22 complex. These protein import complexes are required for
the biogenesis of nearly all mitochondrial proteins and dysregulation poses a significant challenge to maintaining
normal mitochondrial physiology. However, a dearth of structural information has precluded a molecular
understanding of these processes and the mechanisms by which they perform their critical functions.
 Under this award, I will develop groundbreaking three-dimensional (3D) electron cryomicroscopy
(cryoEM) technologies to pioneer studies of these critically important mitochondrial protein import complexes,
providing critical insights into their function and their roles in the disease state. I will utilize targeted biochemical
approaches to isolate the TOM, TIM23, and TIM22 complexes from natural sources for high-resolution cryoEM
studies. I will then develop novel EM sample preparation, data collection and data processing strategies to yield
a suite of high-resolution structures of each of these import machines during active preprotein import. I will then
quantify the degree of local and global dynamics within these states through novel atomic modeling strategies
as a means to define the conformational landscape. I will then establish in vitro functional assays to test key
molecular steps during these processes. Lastly, I will then develop correlated light microscopy and high-
resolution electron cryotomography (cryoET) methodologies to determine structure of these import complexes
in their native membranes. Through these combined efforts, I will answer fundamental questions pertaining to
the overall 3D architecture of these complexes and fully describe the molecular motions necessary for these
import machines to import and fold mitochondrial preproteins. Importantly, these methodologies can be extended
beyond the immediate scope of this award and be applied ubiquitously across the cryoEM community."

Alcohol consumption and mortality due to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are increasing in the United
States, and ALD is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. The natural history of ALD is distinct from
other etiologies of liver disease, with more advanced disease at the time of presentation but also opportunity
for hepatic recovery. Accurate prediction of outcome remains challenging. The proposed research will establish
a prospective registry and biorepository that will evaluate the outcomes of patients with ALD and alcohol use
disorder who are hospitalized with acute hepatic decompensation. This study will take a multifaceted approach,
considering the biologic and psychosocial influences on clinical outcomes. Patients will be recruited during
hospitalization and followed for 2 years in the outpatient clinics, with longitudinal measures of alcohol use
patterns, serum biomarkers, radiographic features, nutrition, frailty/sarcopenia, and non-invasive assessments
of fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis. Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the cohort and optimize retention
procedures using frequent communication, collateral contacts, and technology-based resources, (2) Identify
distinct trajectories of ALD using latent class trajectory analysis and the predictors of trajectory classification,
and (3) Develop a patient-specific risk prediction model to predict hepatic recovery after an acute hepatic
decompensation. These project aims will identify distinct phenotypes and predictors of outcome in ALD and
improve prognostication to better target interventions and allocate resources. The principal investigator (PI) is a
hepatologist and clinical researcher at Stanford University, with a long-term vision of improving care for
patients with ALD. Her experience with outcomes research and her Master’s in Clinical Research and
Epidemiology have prepared her well to execute the project aims. The proposed research and career
development plan are well-supported by a multi-disciplinary mentorship team and the institution. The PI will
acquire advanced skills in longitudinal data analysis and machine learning, as well as content expertise in
alcohol research, which will allow her to apply advanced statistical techniques to optimize prediction of
outcome in ALD in a clinically relevant context. In addition, she will have a well-characterized ALD registry and
biorepository to serve as a platform for future translational and multicenter studies. This award will provide the
PI with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to develop an independent research
career in ALD and improve our understanding of this serious and prevalent condition."
11137259,"Recent advances using pharmacotherapy greatly expand treatment options for diabetic
retinopathy. Intravitreal anti-VEGF immunotherapy has proven to be effective in resolving both
neovascular diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME)(1-5). Large clinical
studies, however, reveal that about 40% of patients do not respond to anti-VEGF therapy(1-3)
and the withdrawal of anti-VEGF after the long-term use can lead to rebound effects with
worsening of the symptoms. Importantly, anti-VEGF treatments are directed at the very late
stage in the disease, when full reversal of retinal damage is difficult. Thus, a conceptual and
technical breakthrough to identify novel targets and a strategy to cure this complication is
paramount.
 Unique metabolic demands and highly specialized structure and function of the retina
dictate complex regulatory pathways to support retinal metabolism while preserving autonomy
behind the blood-retinal barrier (BRB)(6). This intricate balance is lost in a diabetic
environment(7-9). An important example of such dysregulation is the shift in the dial of
sphingolipid rheostat from protective, pro-barrier very long chain (VLC) ceramides (C≥26) to
pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic Short Chain (SC) ceramides (C≤24). SC ceramides in the
retina are mainly produced from sphingomyelins by acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) (10-14).
Production of VLC ceramides involves Elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 4
(ELOVL4)-mediated synthesis of VLC saturated fatty acids that are then incorporated into
ceramides by the action of ceramide synthases (CerS)(15).
 We have previously demonstrated that ASM is highly upregulated(10) and ELOVL4 is
downregulated(19) in the diabetic retina. Downregulation of ASM or upregulation of ELOVL4
were protective against diabetes-induced retinal vascular degeneration in cell culture and
animal models(10, 20).
 We hypothesize that the shift in the ceramide rheostat dial from SC to VLC
ceramides will improve the outcome of diabetic retinopathy by: 1) preventing SC
ceramide-mediated pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic changes while 2) maintaining
VLC-ceramide barrier function."

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-skin cancer in American men, with a lifetime incidence of 1 in 7,
and also the second leading cause of cancer death in American men. Androgen receptor (AR) is the primary
oncogenic driver of PC growth, survival and progression. AR-directed therapy is currently the principal
treatment regimen. Despite initial response rates exceeding 90%, PC eventually relapses and progresses to
fatal castration-resistant PC (CRPC), where reactivation of AR signaling occurs in a low-androgen environment.
Recent introduction of FDA-approved next-generation antiandrogens, including enzalutamide (ENZ) and
abiraterone acetate (ABI), have improved the CRPC treatment landscape, but emergence of drug resistance
remains nearly universal, with no AR-targeted therapeutic options afterwards. These dismal facts underscore
the pressing clinical need to identify new molecular targets and develop effective therapies to combat
advanced PC. Through integrated analysis of publicly available clinical PC data sets coupled with functional
studies in AR-positive PC cells, we propose monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), which synergizes with AR to
promote PC, as an ideal therapeutic candidate to complement AR-targeted therapy in CRPC. We identified a
novel reciprocal interaction between MAOA and AR in PC cells. MAOA expression is induced by androgen
treatment; and conversely, MAOA silencing significantly reduces AR activity by lowering AR target gene
expression and responsiveness to androgen stimulation in PC cells under both androgen-replete and depleted
conditions as well as in a CRPC xenograft model. We showed significant positive co-expression of MAOA and
AR target genes (PSA, TMPRSS2, NKX3.1) in multiple clinical data sets, including CRPC. Importantly, we
found MAOA genomic amplification and/or epigenetic activation in 64% of samples in a CRPC data set,
reinforced by elevated MAOA protein expression in our CRPC patient cohort. Additionally, we demonstrated
that inhibition of MAOA by genetic or pharmacological approaches enhanced the growth-inhibiting effects of
ENZ and ABI in androgen-sensitive, CR and antiandrogen-resistant PC cells. Based on these findings, we will
test the hypothesis that MAOA synergizes with AR through reciprocal crosstalk and convergent downstream
signaling to amply MAOA/AR effects promoting AR-driven PC growth and progression, and that co-targeting
MAOA/AR is an actionable, effective strategy to treat CRPC and reverse antiandrogen drug resistance. To
address this hypothesis, three aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanistic basis of MAOA-
AR reciprocal interaction in PC cells. In Aim 2, we will characterize the role of MAOA in regulating the
development and progression of CRPC in xenograft models. In Aim 3, we will determine the efficacy of MAOA
inhibitors for treating CRPC and reversing resistance to next-generation antiandrogens in vitro and in vivo.
These studies will provide fundamental innovative insights into AR regulation in CRPC and illuminate a path
toward the development of new combination therapy for advanced PC."

Autistic females (iASD) and females with fragile X syndrome (FXS) are two clinical groups that are significantly
understudied in research. Despite the fact that, like their male peers, females experience pervasive, lifelong
difficulties with language, adaptive functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, and academic achievement, there
remains a dearth of research regarding phenotypic development in iASD females and females with FXS. FXS
is the most common inherited cause of intellectual disability and the most common single gene cause of ASD,
with 14-45% of females with FXS having a co-occurring ASD diagnosis. Research on males has identified key
areas of overlap and distinction between FXS and iASD, particularly in language and cognition. Thus, studies
comparing the phenotypes of FXS and iASD in females, focusing on areas of overlap and divergence, are
particularly important because they provide the foundation for clinical and educational planning and elucidating
the mechanisms producing the phenotypes of FXS and iASD. Executive functions are one aspect of cognition
that has received significant attention in FXS and iASD, since they are an important contributor to real-world
outcomes and particularly amenable to treatment. The hierarchical competing systems model of executive
functions describes the interrelationships between language and executive functions in neurotypical
development, but these relationships have yet to be explored in iASD females and females with FXS. Both
language and executive functions are known to have a significant and pervasive impact on critical
developmental outcomes including academic skills (i.e., literacy), adaptive behavior, and psychiatric
symptomatology. The impact of language and executive functions on these outcomes has not been explored in
iADS females and females with FXS. There is an urgent need to characterize the language and cognitive
phenotypes of school-age iASD females and females with FXS within a developmental framework to
understand the nature and course of development, and impact over time on important outcomes. Through
three specific aims, we will determine the extent, nature and syndrome specificity of impairments in language
and executive functions in iASD females and females with FXS, and test their causal relationships through
longitudinal associations. We will recruit 8-12 year-old females with FXS (n = 60) and iASD females (n = 60).
The proposed study will include standardized assessments, expressive language samples, experimental tasks,
and parent report measures taken at two time points. We will determine the impact of language and executive
functions on key developmental outcomes including literacy, adaptive functioning, and psychiatric
symptomatology. The data from this study will provide critical information for clinicians and educators working
with iASD females and females with FXS and will provide data necessary for the development of targeted
interventions for cognitive and language skills directly impacting developmental outcomes."

Without intervention, by the end of this century, extreme heat will cause tens of thousands of excess deaths,
particularly from respiratory and cardiovascular causes. Beyond the impacts of short-duration heat events,
such as heat waves, it is critical to understand the effects of chronic heat exposure, assessed where most
heat-related deaths occur: indoors. Improving understanding of individual and neighborhood characteristics
that heighten or reduce heat vulnerability is also crucial, for informing the design of effective heat adaptation
strategies. Yet, current knowledge of heat-related mortality and vulnerability remains limited in at least three
ways. First, most research on heat-related death has quantified associations between short-term temperature
spikes and acute mortality outcomes, leaving uncertainty about the total mortality burden of chronic heat
exposure. Second, most research has calculated associations with outdoor rather than indoor temperatures,
thus potentially under-estimating the mortality impacts of heat and leaving critical gaps in knowledge about
safe maximum indoor temperature thresholds. Third, little is known about the extent to which housing
interventions that promote thermal comfort and conserve energy, such as improving insulation or altering
roofing material, may prevent excess deaths from chronic indoor heat exposure. There is an urgent need to fill
these gaps since most people, and especially heat vulnerable subpopulations including individuals over age
65, spend the majority of their time indoors. We propose the first ever population-based, nationally
representative, quasi-experimental, longitudinal cohort study of the effects of chronic indoor heat exposure on
mortality in the United States. We will use data on age 65 and older adult participants of the Mortality
Disparities in America Communities (MDAC) study linked with Medicare and National Death Index data. This
remarkably rich data set, which contains follow up on individuals for up to eight years, will be combined with
indoor temperature and humidity variables calculated using rigorous, extensively validated, physics-based
simulation models; individual-level housing characteristics; and high-resolution land cover data. To improve
understanding of associations between the housing environment, chronic indoor heat exposures and mortality,
and person- and neighborhood-level determinants of heat vulnerability, we pursue three aims. In Aim 1, we
quantify associations between chronic indoor heat exposures and all-cause and cause-specific mortality, and
identify climate-zone specific, safe upper thresholds for hot-season indoor temperatures. In Aim 2, we
elucidate person- and neighborhood-level factors that enhance or reduce vulnerability to chronic indoor heat
exposure. In Aim 3, we quantify the total excess deaths that may be prevented through housing interventions
that improve thermal comfort, under current and future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. This impactful
project will provide information that is critically needed to guide interventions that balance heat adaptation for
health protection in the most vulnerable subgroups with climate change mitigation goals."
10813202,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Intracellular membrane trafficking mediates the intracellular delivery of proteins and lipids. The process is bidirectional
and consists of the anterograde (secretory) and retrograde (endocytic) branches. Intracellular membrane trafficking is
evolutionary conserved, and its machinery is modular, with functionally homologous components operating on different
trafficking steps. Therefore, a detailed understanding of one trafficking step will help in understanding the entire
intracellular membrane trafficking process.
The Conserved Oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex operates as a vesicular tether for intra-Golgi trafficking. The Golgi is
the central hub for protein posttranslational modifications, mostly glycosylation. Consequently, the primary job of the
COG is to tether vesicles that recycle resident enzymes and cargo receptors. To achieve its function, the COG interacts
with SNAREs, Rabs, and other tethers, but the detailed understanding of these interactions is an enigma that we propose
to solve by pairwise probing of COG/partner interactions, their kinetics, and by defining their molecular environment
through proximity-labeling studies. Depletion of COG causes accumulation of specific transport intermediates – COG
complex dependent (CCD) vesicles that are likely to represent a major class of Golgi vesicles that recycle Golgi enzymes
and cargo receptors.
Mutations in COG subunits result in congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) type II category, which belong to a
group of autosomal recessive multi-systemic disorders with several distinguishable symptoms that include global
developmental defects and microcephaly. These deficits are often accompanied by neurological and liver impairment.
COG-CDG defects are studied in patients’ fibroblasts, which do not represent the most affected tissues; a more flexible
cell base model will benefit our progress in developing a cure for this disorder.
We hypothesize that a revealing of the molecular basis of COG/partner interactions will help in deciphering the
mechanisms of assembly/disassembly of vesicle docking platforms and that a detailed analysis of different populations of
CCD vesicles will uncover their specific origin, budding and tethering machinery and a complete set of proteins that
traffic in a COG-dependent manner. The development of cell-based models for COG-CDGs will allow us to test the
effects of different COG mutations without the need for patient involvement and pave the way for the development of
treatment protocols. To test this hypothesis, first, we will characterize in molecular interactions between COG and its key
partner proteins (Aim1). Next, we will use a degrone-assisted COG depletion to accumulate, purify and characterize CCD
vesicles (Aim2). Finally, we will develop and characterize a novel iPSC-based cellular model for COG CDGs (Aim 3).
Success in accomplishing these aims will provide a mechanistic understanding of COG complex function, characterize
COG-dependent trafficking intermediates, and create a set of isogenic stem cell lines bearing human COG mutations.
Moreover, these results will be necessary for a functional understanding of Golgi dynamic and vesicular trafficking in
general."

 This K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Catherine
Avitabile, a pediatric cardiologist and pulmonary hypertension specialist, for an independent research career
focused on exercise interventions to improve lean mass, functional capacity, and quality of life in children with
pulmonary hypertension and other heart diseases. Dr. Avitabile’s application is strengthened by her clinical
expertise and her prior research demonstrating lean mass (skeletal muscle) deficits in association with worse
exercise performance in cardiac patients. Under the mentorship of Drs. Babette Zemel and Stephen Paridon,
Dr. Avitabile will pursue a comprehensive career development plan with training in exercise physiology and
interventions, body composition assessment, wearable activity monitoring, and qualitative methods.
 The growing population of pulmonary hypertension survivors report low quality of life and exercise
intolerance. Children with pulmonary hypertension engage in less physical activity compared to peers, which is
a concern since adult data support exercise as a non-pharmacologic therapy. Exercise training safely improves
exercise performance and quality of life in adults with pulmonary hypertension and in one small pediatric study,
but therapeutic exercise has not been widely adopted in pediatric pulmonary hypertension. While
cardiopulmonary status may limit exercise participation, other barriers to participation have not been explored. It
is also unclear how exercise interventions have a clinical effect as they may have multiple targets. Skeletal
muscle abnormalities are associated with worse exercise performance in adults with pulmonary hypertension
and could be modifiable through exercise interventions. Dr. Avitabile has identified skeletal muscle abnormalities
in children with pulmonary hypertension, and these are the focus of her research interests.
 Exercise interventions that slow symptom progression would improve wellbeing for pediatric pulmonary
hypertension survivors and their families. Dr. Avitabile’s proposed research will increase understanding of the
health consequences of physical inactivity and identify barriers to exercise in pediatric pulmonary hypertension
patients in order to design effective exercise interventions. Aim 1 explores the association between physical
inactivity and muscle deficits. Aim 2 employs qualitative interviews to identify barriers to physical activity in order
to strengthen intervention design. Aim 3 tests the feasibility and preliminary estimates of efficacy of a home
exercise intervention to increase physical activity and improve functional status. The intervention is enriched by
data from wearable activity monitors, closely aligned with the priorities of the 2016-2020 NIH-Wide Strategic
Plan. This K23 award will support Dr. Avitabile’s pathway to independence as a pediatric cardiologist/pulmonary
hypertension expert skilled in exercise physiology and interventions, body composition assessment, and mobile
health technologies. These skills will support her future R01 proposals that will use exercise to improve survivor
wellbeing and will provide a model for exercise interventions in other cardiac patient groups."
10809715,"We propose a transformative approach, inspired by the mechanism of action of antisense oligonucleotides
(ASOs), to deliver small molecules that selectively cleave RNA targets in cells and in animals. As a state-of-the-
art modality to target RNA, ASOs bind to complementary RNAs and recruit endogenous RNase H, which then
cleaves the RNA to eliminate it from the cell. As an alternative to ASOs, we have developed a class of small
molecules that selectively bind to and cleave an RNA target and have shown that our new cleaving small
molecules are more potent than simple binding compounds. Our approach, dubbed Ribonuclease targeting
chimeras (RIBOTACs), engineers small molecules to recruit endogenous RNase L, an RNase expressed at
minute levels in cells in a latent form (hence RNase L). The chimeras, comprised of RNA-binding modules and
a heterocyclic RNase L-recruiting module, activate RNase L locally at the site of the desired target. We will fully
develop our RIBOTAC approach to cleave RNA targets sub-stoichiometrically and catalytically with small
molecules, providing a direct means to improve the potency of simple binding compounds. Collectively, we will
deliver a platform to program small molecules to cleave specific, malfunctioning RNAs in cells and in animals,
with superior properties as compared to ASOs.
 In support of these goals, we propose in Aim 1 to characterize comprehensively our lead RIBOTAC targeting
miR-21 in vitro and in situ, a benchmark for lead optimization. Our new studies show that the binding compound
from which this RIBOTAC is derived inhibits metastasis in an orthotopic xenograft model. Further, the RIBOTAC
is 20-fold more potent than the simple binding compound in situ for inhibiting miR-21 biogenesis and breast
cancer cell phenotypes. Of import, we will study and quantify the selectivity of the RIBOTAC transcriptome- and
proteome-wide. In Aim 2, we will lead optimize our RIBOTAC to deliver a proof-of-concept compound with
properties amenable for in vivo testing. These DMPK-driven studies will optimize all components of the
RIBOTAC, from the RNA-binding modules to the linker that tethers them together to the RNase L-recruiting
module. We will rigorously assess top RIBOTACs in the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-
MB-231, including full assessment and quantification of selectivity transcriptome- and proteome-wide. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will study optimized RIBOTACs for activity against a panel of TNBC and patient-derived (PDX)
tumor cells ex vivo and in vivo. After confirming miR-21 destruction by our RIBOTACs, we will assess their
effects on TNBC cell: (i) proliferation; (ii) survival; (iii) migration and invasion; and (iv) expression of EMT and
breast cancer stem cell markers. RIBOTACs with the broadest activity against TNBCs will be evaluated for
efficacy in vivo."

Coordination of cell migration, proliferation and cell fate determination is critical for stem cell function and tissue
repair. We have identified that P16Ink4a, the classic pro-senescence and aging regulator, participates in the
regulation of healthy adult muscle stem cells. We find a role for P16Ink4a in cell migration and cell fate decisions
via the cytoskeleton and contractile machinery. This has not been reported previously. The long-term goal is to
understand how P16Ink4a is induced and regulates cytoskeletal function of healthy progenitor cells in non-aged
tissues. The first aim will combine temporal regulated and cell specific genetic strategies to determine the role of
P16Ink4a in healthy adult muscle stem cells. The second aim will dissect the functional and molecular
mechanism that regulates cell mechanics, migration and cell fate via P16Ink4a. The third aim will examine the
role of P16Ink4a in cell autonomous regulation of its own microenvironment. Understanding the role of P16Ink4a
in progenitor cell function will lead to important insights for aging, senescence, cancer and muscle degenerative
diseases."

Understanding information flow in cortical circuits requires understanding both the anatomical connectivity
between neurons and the way in which inputs to a neuron are integrated to generate a spiking output. Many
techniques are now available to study connectivity across cells and brain areas, but the dendritic integration of
these inputs is challenging to observe because we lack access to the complex electrical signals in fine dendrites.
The potential for fluorescent voltage sensors to revolutionize our understanding of the functional role of dendritic
integration in cortical circuits has been recognized for decades. However, in practice, fluorescent voltage sensors
have lacked the necessary characteristics in terms of brightness, sensitivity, and photostability to enable their
use in the challenging application of dendritic imaging in vivo. Furthermore, many fluorescent voltage sensors
are unsuitable for two-photon imaging, which is required to resolve dendrites at the scale of individual branches
and spines hundreds of microns deep in intact tissue. A new generation of genetically-encoded “JEDI” sensors
developed in the St. Pierre lab here at BCM overcome many of these limitations, and have now been validated
for two-photon somatic imaging in vivo. These validation experiments suggest that JEDI sensors have the
necessary sensitivity, photostability, and brightness to enable imaging of electrical activity in dendrites in vivo.
Complementing the development of these sensors, technologies for two-photon imaging of dendrites, including
adaptive optics for increasing spatial resolution and Bessel beam shaping for imaging sparsely-labeled dendrites
have been developed by the Ji lab at Berkeley. These techniques have been validated with dendritic calcium
imaging, but have not been combined with JEDI voltage sensors in dendrites in vivo. In this R34 proposal, we
will perform a careful series of validation measurements that will enable us to optimize advanced two-photon
imaging of JEDI voltage sensors for interrogating dendritic electrophysiology. These experiments will
unambiguously reveal the extent to which this approach has sufficient temporal and spatial resolution to enable
observations of key aspects of dendritic integration in vivo. Optimizing these techniques will be widely valuable
for the field, and will enable a future BRAIN Circuits project to answer fundamental questions about how
pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex circuits integrate different sources of visual information in their
dendritic arbors, and how this process of integration is shaped by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine across
different brain states."
10904699,"Over 490K Americans fracture their tibia (shinbone) yearly, and require surgery. However, patient recovery 1
year following surgery is poor and inconsistent with 2/3 of patients reporting an inability to do pre-injury leisure
activities and 1/2 still not having recovered enough to return to work. A key role of clinicians after tibial shaft
fracture surgery is to prescribe a rehabilitation exercise program that exposes each patient's tibia to increasing
forces to gradually recover the ability to do pre-injury activities. However, major limitations holding back
progress in the field are the lack of knowledge on how much tibial force patients experience during daily
activities, in their rehabilitation program throughout recovery, and how tibial force early in recovery affects
longer-term functional recovery. The overarching goal of this work is to generate the knowledgebase and tools
that will enable us to reimagine and elevate the standard of care for individuals after tibial shaft fracture
surgery, by monitoring and managing tibial bone forces in daily life. We propose to accomplish the overarching
objective through the following aims. Aim 1: Characterize tibial bone force in patients at home over the first
year following surgery. Aim 2: Create the first clinical reference guide that ranks tibial forces during commonly-
prescribed rehabilitation exercises. Aim 3: Assess if higher tibial forces during early recovery correspond with
better functional outcomes at 6- and 12-month follow up. If our hypothesis is supported then these results
would inform new clinical guidelines (target bone force thresholds) and biofeedback interventions to monitor
and promote healthy bone forces in recovery. This wearable monitoring paradigm has unparalleled potential to
be adapted to elevate care for recovery from numerous musculoskeletal disorders."

The ultimate goal of this project is to discover and validate the gene Х heavy metal (GXM) interactions in
human livers and to understand their role in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is the most
common chronic liver disease affecting over 30% of the U.S population, resulting in a heavy social burden.
NAFLD is characterized by a spectrum of histological changes with multiple cells involved. Currently, no
approved drug treatment is available for NAFLD. Therefore, it is an urgent need to identify both genetic and
environmental risk factors to facilitate the development of new diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic
strategies. NAFLD is a typical complex disease involving gene-environment (GXE) interactions. Over the past
decade, while GWAS for NAFLD have identified numerous genetic risk alleles, a growing body of research has
demonstrated that exposure to heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Hg, As, etc.) are associated with increased NAFLD risk.
However, there is no compelling study thus far to assess the correlation between various naturally
accumulated metals in human livers and the NAFLD histology, especially in clinically defined patient cohorts.
More importantly, there lacks critical knowledge about how naturally and chronically accumulated metals
interact with the liver genome and together confer risks for NAFLD. Our preliminary studies in human liver
tissues have successfully demonstrated that multiple metals are indeed correlated with NAFLD. By leveraging
our previously collected multi-omics data, we have preliminarily identified numerous metal-response genes
(MR-genes), expression quantitative traits loci (eQTLs), and allele-specific expression loci (ASEs), which are
further enriched to NAFLD and its related pathways. We aim in this study to further expand our study to a
large-scale, highly detailed, and integrated analysis to thoroughly understand the role of GXM interactions in
NAFLD in humans. To this end, our team has been collaborating to establish collections for human liver tissue,
cells and NAFLD patient cohorts. We have also developed various technical platforms e.g. bulk/single cell (Sc)
RNAseq and ATAC-seq, as well as multiple bioinformatics and statistical tools for GXE data analyses. With
these preparations, we specifically aim: 1) To profile heavy metals in frozen human liver tissues (n=560),
identify MR-genes, eQTLs/ASEs, and test their associations with NAFLD; 2) To treat the primary liver cell
populations with various metals and to elucidate how the genome of different liver cells respond to metals with
Sc-RNAseq and ATAC-seq, and 3) To validate the association between GXM interactions and NAFLD
histology severity in a large clinically defined NAFLD patient cohort (n=1313). Our study will for the first time
evaluate the role and mechanism of GXM interactions in NAFLD and will provide the scientific community
important data to open new avenues to NAFLD research, drug discovery, and beyond."

The broad goal of this project is to determine whether shifting the temporal distribution of
macronutrient intake impacts metabolic markers of health, which holds great translational value
for vulnerable populations, including night shift workers. Night work is increasingly prevalent and
a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (T2D). We and others have shown that circadian misalignment
itself, i.e., the misalignment between the eating/fasting cycle and the central circadian timing
system, leads to impaired glucose tolerance and decreased insulin sensitivity, even in chronic
shift workers. Circadian misalignment is thus a likely mechanism contributing to the increased
T2D risk in night workers. Because night work is not likely to go away anytime soon,
countermeasures against these adverse metabolic effects are desperately needed. Our
preliminary data from stringently-controlled circadian experiments suggests that glucose
tolerance, beta-cell function, and diet-induced thermogenesis are increased in the circadian
morning compared to the circadian evening, and that—in contrast—fat tolerance is increased in
the circadian evening compared to the circadian morning. Based on these insights, we have
developed a novel and translational approach that combines the concepts of the importance of
WHAT we eat with the importance of WHEN we eat: scheduling high-carb intake for the circadian
morning and high-fat intake for the circadian evening (C/F; expected to be favorable) as compared
to vice versa (F/C, high-fat for circadian morning and high-carb for circadian evening), without
changing 24-h caloric or macronutrient intake. Using two highly-controlled, within-subject,
randomized, crossover protocols (one under circadian alignment, one under circadian
misalignment), we will test the hypotheses that high-carb intake during the biological morning and
high-fat intake during the biological evening (C-F) compared to vice versa (F-C) leads to: higher
glucose tolerance (Aim 1); higher diet-induced thermogenesis (Aim 2); and higher fat tolerance
(Exploratory Aim 3). We will test these aims in a robust and sophisticated study design: (1) without
disturbing sleep during the day; (2) without requiring extended fasting during wakefulness at night;
(3) without changing the caloric content per meal; and (4) without changing 24-h caloric or 24-h
macronutrient intake. Knowledge on the health impacts of macronutrient intake timing is not only
important for shift workers but also for the general population. Therefore, these questions will not
only be addressed under circadian misalignment but also circadian alignment."

Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a leading infectious disease and cause of
death worldwide. The growing burden of drug-resistant (DR)-TB is complicating TB treatment. Early diagnosis of
TB with drug susceptibility testing (DST) is critical for successful treatment and is the first pillar of the World
Health Organization’s (WHO) End TB Strategy. DST is achieved via phenotypic or genotypic methods.
Traditionally, phenotypic DST is performed on solid (Löwenstein Jensen) or liquid media (MGIT) in a two-step
process: first a culture to identify M.tb growth, and then re-culture of the isolate with the drugs to be tested. In
addition to requiring biosafety level II-plus labs, the DST process, if available in low-middle income settings, can
take 42 to ~6 months from sample collection to notification of results to the clinical provider resulting in treatment
delays, continued transmission, and higher mortality. Conversely, genotypic DST has many advantages,
including a reduced time to result (< 2h for GeneXpert) and the possibility of deployment to at or near point of
care (POC). However, its widespread use in high TB burden resource-limited settings is hindered by the need
for regular power supply and importantly cost. Thus, NIH/NIAID is redirecting attention to innovative and simple
phenotypic DST solutions to be deployed at or near POC.
The goal of this application is to develop the 1G test into the 2G test, providing higher flexibility to perform DST
for 1st and 2nd frontline drugs, including drugs prescribed for DS- and DR-TB regimens such RIPE (DS-TB oral
regimen composed of RIF/INH/PZA/Ethambutol), HPMZ (DS-TB 4-month short course oral drug regimen
composed of INH/Rifapentine/MFX/PZA) and BPaL [MDR- and pre-XDR oral drug regimen composed of
bedaquiline (BDQ), pretomanid (PMD) and linezolid (LNZ)], as well as clofazimine (CFZ) and delamanid (DLM),
other WHO recommended oral agents for DR-TB. Because the 2G test is non-proprietary, its cost is expected to
be extremely low (< $8) and mainly driven by the cost of drugs. Further, for the 1G test we tested a simple step
to digest/decontaminate sputa that does not require equipment, meeting the near to POC test definition. We will
optimize this sputum-processing protocol for use with the 2G test. We propose to: Aim 1) Develop and validate
the 2G test by defining the stability and critical concentration (CC) for new drugs against known DR-M.tb strains,
and optimize appropriate sputum digestion and decontamination protocols for this test; Aim 2) Determine the
agreement of the 2G test with current gold standard methods for phenotypic DST for each of the 11 drugs, and
Aim 3) Determine the accuracy of the 2G test against reference phenotypic DST protocols using freshly collected
sputa in field settings and assess its usability, acceptability, and feasibility.
We expect that the novel, simple, affordable and sustainable 2G test will provide a significant improvement when
compared to current phenotypic DST reference methods, allowing rapid and tailored treatment for DS-/DR-TB
in low- and middle-income countries with high TB burden."
10830459,"Motor axon loss is a cardinal symptom of motor neuron disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). Schwann cells (SCs) myelinate and provide trophic support to axons in the peripheral nervous system
(PNS) and disruption of SC metabolism often leads to axon degeneration, both symptoms of peripheral
neuropathy. The lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes that glycolytic glial support cells supply lactate to axons to
sustain their high metabolic demands, a process that requires interconversion of lactate and pyruvate via lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) in both glia and neurons. To test this hypothesis in the PNS, we deleted LDH subunits
LDHA and LDHB specifically in motor neurons (MNs), sensory neurons (SNs), or SCs. We find that LDH deletion
in SCs or MNs leads to progressive degeneration of motor axons, whereas LDH loss in SNs causes no apparent
abnormalities in sensory axons. These results support a model in which lactate shuttling from SCs selectively
sustains motor but not sensory axons and suggest that LDH activity and lactate shuttling play a role in motor-
dominated neuropathies such as ALS. Indeed, LDHB-deficient mice develop progressive motor dysfunction
similar to ALS mouse models, and LDH deficiency synergizes with a slowly progressing ALS model to induce
severe, early onset disease. In conjunction with these studies, we identified rare loss-of-function LDHB mutations
in ALS patients.
 In this proposal, we outline experiments to examine the differential responses of MN and SN neurons to
loss of LDH function to identify pathways involved in the observed selective motor axon degeneration. We will
use a cellular complementation assay utilizing iPSC-derived neurons to dissect components involved in support
of peripheral motor axons. We will use biochemical and cellular complementation assays to examine LDHB
variants found in ALS patients and controls to determine if deleterious variants are enriched in ALS. We will
study mice lacking specific LDH isoforms in defined cell types to determine the cells involved in motor axon
metabolic support and the pathways they invoke to influence axon health. Additionally, we will use these LDH
mutant mice to interrogate how compromised lactate/pyruvate metabolism interacts with other ALS risk factors
to speed disease progression. Results of these studies will establish the relationship between LDH,
lactate/pyruvate metabolism in the PNS, and development of motor neuron diseases including ALS, and
stimulate development of new axo-protective therapeutics for these devastating disorders."

methods that enable participation from the home and collection of data directly from participants. Such
decentralized research studies that harness video visits, digital tools and participant reporting, can reach a large,
geographically dispersed population of participants, increase the frequency and scope of evaluation, and reduce
the burden of participation. Parkinson’s disease, a clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder that
causes progressive disability, is well suited to such a model. Traditional assessments are typically subjective,
insensitive to change, and limited to episodic administration and therefore fail to capture the complexity of
Parkinson’s disease. AT-HOME PD, the largest on-going decentralized longitudinal observational Parkinson’s
disease study with digital tools, is remotely characterizing ~225 participants with Parkinson’s disease from two
NINDS-funded, phase 3 clinical trials, STEADY-PD III and SURE-PD3. These studies yielded cohorts with
comprehensive clinical phenotyping, whole genome sequencing, and serial plasma collection. AT-HOME PD
participants are being characterized through video visits, smartphone-based assessments, and an online survey
platform. The cohort is now approaching mid-stage Parkinson’s disease, presenting an opportunity to advance
our understanding of this under-studied population, improve the prediction of clinically relevant disease
milestones like falls and cognitive impairment, quantify physical activity, and identify sensitive remote disease
measures. This project will extend the follow-up of this cohort by 3 years and expand digital phenotyping of
participants, using smartphone-based assessments and two wrist-worn sensors. The aims of this project are to
1) evaluate the extent to which digital tools and remote participant reporting can improve the prediction of
clinically relevant disease milestones compared with traditional measures, 2) quantify longitudinal change in
physical activity, steps taken, and gait in mid-stage Parkinson’s disease in the real-world, and 3) explore the
relationship between physical activity and clinical outcomes in mid-stage Parkinson’s disease. We will generate
a dataset with approximately 10 continuous years of data on PD progression that begins prior to use of
dopaminergic medications and progresses to midstage Parkinson’s disease and beyond. This rich dataset will
accelerate therapeutic development by filling knowledge gaps in the mid-stage Parkinson’s disease population,
helping to optimize models for conducting patient-centered remote research, evaluating new methods for
predicting disease outcomes, and evaluating remote outcome measures."
10817150,"Administrative Core Abstract
The HPC Administrative Core provides the administrative support needed to ensure that the scientific goals of
the HPC are accomplished. The goals of the Core are to support the leadership of the Center and coordinate
its relationships with advisory groups, University initiatives, and outside entities; to manage the basic
infrastructure of the Center and ensure that the Development and Scientific Cores work smoothly together; to
disseminate HPC Associates’ research and facilitate networking and collaboration; and to conduct oversight for
the Center as a whole, undertaking evaluations of the HPC’s success in accomplishing its overall goals and
reporting back to the leadership and Faculty Coordinating Committee on evaluation metrics. The Core is led by
Dr. Emily Agree (Associate Director of the HPC). The Core is staffed by the HPC Assistant Director, an
Administrative Coordinator, an IT Specialist, and a population Informationist. This Core is critical to the success
of the HPC. It makes sure that the services of the Development and Scientific Core are provided efficiently,
and that they are complementary and coordinated. While the Development and Scientific Cores more directly
address Associates’ research and career development needs, the Administrative Core is essential to the
effective delivery of all Center services. The HPC brings together Associates not only across disciplines, but
also bridges seven schools across campuses of Johns Hopkins University, making central administration of
services especially important to our success. The Administrative Core ensures that equal access to support is
available to all Associates, that our seminars and workshops are accessible across campuses, and that our
Associates’ research is broadly disseminated both within and outside the university. The Administrative Core
also is critical to monitoring our progress toward target goals for success, reviewing new directions, and
changing services and delivery as needed."
10867345,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Efforts to translate genomic sequencing technologies into clinical care have faced ongoing challenges defining
and measuring utility. Evaluation of utility (and disutility) is particularly difficult in the context of efforts to
translate genomic sequencing technologies like exome sequencing (ES) and genome sequencing (GS) to the
diagnosis of children with undiagnosed genetic conditions, since these conditions are rarely responsive to
pharmacological interventions and parents often express a wide variety of reasons for wanting a genomic
diagnosis for their child. We hypothesize that previous efforts to identify the effects (positive, negative, and
neutral) of ES and GS have missed important dimensions of utility that fall in the “middle ground” between
conventional notions of clinical and personal utility. Most of the care and services that improve functioning and
quality of life for children with complex genetic conditions occur outside doctors’ offices: physical therapy;
occupational therapy; speech-language pathology; behavioral intervention and other mental healthcare; and
special education services. However, it is unknown whether receiving a genomic diagnosis currently provides
utility or disutility in these community contexts, and what evidence might be needed to increase utility and
minimize disutility. This project will address this gap through a rigorous study of potential and actual effects that
children with undiagnosed genetic conditions might experience in community settings as a result of receiving a
genomic diagnosis. The overall aim of this study is to identify (1) community-based utilities currently being
realized following genomic diagnosis, (2) perspectives of community-based professionals regarding the
potential utility of such diagnoses, and (3) sources of information (including medical professionals, parent
support groups, and social media) that might support utility for rare genetic conditions."

The key functions of the Administrative Core (AC) are to: a) maximize the local, statewide and national impact
of initiatives developed and implemented by the Michigan ADRC; b) enhance collaborations across the three
partner universities comprising the consortium (University of Michigan, Wayne State University and Michigan
State University) and with the NACC, NCRAD and outside investigators; c) provide sound oversight for fiscal
and personnel matters; and d) ensure rigor, integrity and transparency in the research and activities supported
by the center. The AC’s stable leadership ensures that the various research, training and outreach initiatives
managed by the Cores will maintain synergy and connection to the Michigan ADRC’s central theme, which is
to identify, understand and modulate the myriad non-β-amyloid factors that contribute to brain dysfunction and
neurodegeneration in AD and related dementias. The AC will ensure a broadly supportive environment for all
investigators, but particularly for junior investigators, with the goal of nurturing a diverse group of next-
generation leaders. To have maximal effect as an ADRC, the AC will work closely with other centers and
programs across the consortium that are engaged in age-related research, including the six NIA-funded
centers that together comprise the UMAging Initiative. In six aims the AC will: 1) Leverage expert dementia
resources and skills focused in each Core; 2) Maintain cohesive interplay across the Cores; 3) Sustain existing
and build new local and regional partnerships; 4) Sustain existing and build further national partnerships; 5)
Promote efforts to address racial and ethnic disparities in ADRD; and 6) Develop next-generation leaders
through diverse research and training opportunities. In its first cycle as an NIH-designated ADRC, the Michigan
ADRC met its milestones due, in part, to a proactive AC that helped build key state-wide partnerships.
Benefitting from close links to the many complementary NIA-funded programs on our campuses, the
outstanding additional resources of all three universities, and continuing philanthropic success, the Michigan
ADRC is well-positioned to further enrich innovative dementia research, outreach, and training efforts, both
regionally and nationally."
10883726,"ABSTRACT – CORE B: CLINICAL CORE
The Michigan ADRC Clinical Core (CC) supports and advances research on Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD) through recruitment of a longitudinal cohort (LC), whose deep clinical and biomarker
characterization supports the center’s central theme of identifying, understanding, and modulating the non-
amyloid factors contributing to brain dysfunction and neurodegeneration. The CC will continue to draw on its
robust regional infrastructure to expand the LC from 414 active participants to 550 participants, while
maintaining a focus on individuals at risk for or showing the earliest signs of cognitive decline. We will intensify
our commitment to diversity through continued operation of our successful satellite location in Detroit (~40% of
our LC identifies as Black American) and a planned expansion to the Grand Rapids Hispanic/Latino
community. In conjunction with the Data Management and Statistical (DMSC), Biomarker (BC), and
Neuroimaging (NIC) Cores, we will strengthen available dementia-related research resources by sharing UDS
data, biomarker specimens, and neuroimaging scans with the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center and
the National Centralized Repository for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias. CC activities are guided
by 5 aims. Aim 1 will facilitate and enhance cutting-edge clinical research. The CC will continue to support a
wide range of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic clinical trials as well as observational studies that span
the dementia spectrum. Continued NIA funding will enhance our capacity to advance ADRD research at the
three partner universities comprising the Michigan ADRC. Aim 2 will enhance diversity in aging and dementia
research. We will build on our successful Detroit satellite model and expand into the Grand Rapids
Hispanic/Latino community. Aim 3 will promote novel biomarker research. The CC will collaborate with the
DMSC, BC and NIC to facilitate the identification and evaluation of low-cost, non-invasive blood-based
biomarkers, through comparison to the A/T/N (and “V” – vascular) classification provided by structural and
metabolic imaging. Aim 4 will enhance participant experience by developing and refining feedback. We have
identified overwhelming interest among our LC participants in learning their clinical and biomarker results. We
will partner with the Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement Core to ensure ethical disclosure of biomarker
findings and facilitate clinical care as appropriate. Aim 5 will facilitate the training of the next generation of
dementia researchers and clinicians. Collaborating with the Research Education Component, the CC will
leverage the comprehensive resources and diverse training opportunities available for early career
investigators across the campuses of the three participating universities. In summary, the CC will link critical
institutional and regional resources to support multi-disciplinary research, spanning from early detection to
therapeutic intervention. Our emphasis on minority recruitment, novel biomarkers, and participant feedback will
bolster new avenues of research within the Michigan ADRC and the broader ADC network."
10883729,"ABSTRACT – CORE C: DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL CORE
Research on prevention and treatment of heterogeneous Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)
requires knowledge and information that varies by domain, scale and time. Thus, meeting the challenge of
ADRD necessitates big data integrated across disciplines, shared data and collaboration across the Michigan
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) and the entire ADRC network, deployment of appropriate
statistical models, and training of scientists in data methods and statistics. The MADRC Data Management and
Statistical Core (DMSC) will continue to meet these critical needs as it oversees data and statistical analyses
for the MADRC. Data types include clinical/neuropsychological measures, participant recruitment/engagement
metrics, genetics, neuropathologic measures, neuroimaging, and biomarker data that will be integrated by the
DMSC. The DMSC will continue to ensure that the data meet enhanced Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and National Institute Standards and Technology (NIST) safeguards,
IRB compliance and data security. The DMSC works closely with the Research Education Component (REC)
to assist, train and support junior faculty members in becoming independent investigators by providing an
enriched learning environment to increase their statistical and research skills. The overarching goals of the
DMSC are to integrate, share, and scale data through reproducible pipelines, guide data analyses, and train
investigators in these processes. Corresponding to these areas of importance, the DMSC proposes five
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Provide an automated, user friendly, integrated, and secure data collection and
management platform; Aim 2: Provide accessible, integrated, and informative big data and summary scores for
MADRC research needs; Aim 3: Share data, pipelines, and analytic expertise with NACC and related Centers;
Aim 4: Provide data analysis support and consultation at every stage of the research process; Aim 5: Provide
an enriched environment for MADRC investigators to expand their data visualization, analytical, and statistical
knowledge. The DMSC will enhance the comprehensive and state-of-the-art data generated by the MADRC
Cores by informing streamlined data collection and data integration across Cores, our three institutions, and
with the NACC. In the initial funding period, we succeeded in building a reproducible database platform that
combined historic cohort information with new longitudinal participant information. We will expand our activities
to support two new Cores (Biomarker and Neuroimaging) and we will support new and ongoing research
operations. DMSC activities will enhance research collaboration and analytic training across the community of
ADRD researchers. With our highly experienced team, the DMSC is exceptionally well-equipped to ensure that
the MADRC makes seminal contributions to innovative research, outreach, and training across the region and

Statistical Core to collect and properly characterize post-mortem material and associated antemortem
biospecimens and clinical data from ADRC participants. The NC will provide postmortem material and other
biospecimens to investigators while following the best practice guidelines delineated by the 2014 NIA
biospecimen task force for the evaluation, banking and distribution of brain tissue and biospecimens.
Leveraging the diverse expertise of NC investigators in neurodegenerative proteinopathies and a high-content
automated microscopy shared resource, the NC also will facilitate innovative research into the biological
mechanisms of dementia by providing essential reagents, expertise, and access to technologies for
investigators. To accomplish these goals, the NC will pursue the following aims: 1) grow and maintain a brain
bank with well-characterized frozen and fixed tissue, 2) provide accurate, detailed, and standardized
neuropathological evaluation, 3) distribute banked tissue and biospecimens, 4) contribute neuropathologic data
to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC), 5) support researchers studying AD and related
dementias by providing access to innovative technologies, and 6) educate trainees about the neuropathologic
assessment of dementia. Through these aims, the NC will greatly facilitate basic and translational studies of
the dementias, expand the research community actively engaged in this work, and help build new
collaborations for future discoveries."

Biomarkers are becoming instrumental components of effective clinical management and trial coordination for
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), and will be required to enable precision medicine
approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The primary functions of the newly added Biomarker Core (BC) of the
Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (MADRC) will be to facilitate innovative research into
established and novel blood biomarkers, and provide expertise and access to biomarker assay technologies
for investigators at the University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State University, as well as
other ADRCs. The overall goal of the BC is to use cutting-edge ultrasensitive ELISA and quantitative mass
spectrometry (MS) approaches to measure biomarkers in blood, identify and build novel blood-based
biomarker assays, and integrate biomarkers with clinical measures of disease. We will leverage MADRC
resources from ongoing and future efforts to achieve this goal and promote studies that align with the
MADRC’s central theme to identify, understand and modulate the many factors beyond β-amyloid contributing
to ADRD. The diverse patient population in the MADRC’s longitudinal cohort and other ongoing clinical
research efforts, coupled with the ability to develop novel biomarker assays, will significantly enhance the
ability of the BC to focus on unique questions regarding the extent to which current and novel biomarker
targets enhance diagnostic accuracy, and track disease progression and predictability over time in multiple
patient populations, including underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. The BC will pursue the following five
aims: 1) provide measurements of established blood biomarkers, 2) develop and implement novel biomarker
assays, 3) facilitate integration of blood biomarkers with established clinical practices to advance translational
research, 4) contribute blood biomarker data to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center, and 5) educate
and train health care professionals, scientists and students in the use of biomarker assays. The BC goals and
aims will be achieved by working closely with the MADRC Clinical Core, Data Management and Statistical
Core, Neuroimaging Core, Neuropathology Core, and Research Education Component. Through these efforts,
the BC will markedly enhance research supported by the MADRC, leading to a sustained and significant

10906011,"Stress Hydrocortisone In Pediatric Septic Shock (SHIPSS) Project Summary
 Sepsis represents the most common cause of childhood mortality worldwide. In the United
States alone, 200 cases of pediatric sepsis are diagnosed each day, with an associated hospital
mortality rate of 5-10% and health care expenditures now approaching $5 billion annually.
Moreover, nearly 40% of children admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) for septic
shock have not regained their baseline health-related quality of life one year following the sepsis
event.
 During early resuscitation of the child with septic shock, in addition to antibiotics, volume
replacement, and vasoactive-inotropic support, the most recent pediatric treatment guidelines
advise the practitioner to consider adjunctive hydrocortisone therapy if the patient “is at risk of
absolute adrenal insufficiency or adrenal pituitary axis failure”. However, the potential benefits
and risks of this recommendation have not been rigorously examined. On the one hand,
corticosteroids are inexpensive and have been frequently demonstrated to improve
hemodynamic status in children and adults with sepsis. Conversely, this drug class is known to
alter transcription of approximately 30% of the human genome. Notably, corticosteroids down
regulate most aspects of the immune response, but particularly adaptive immunity. Moreover,
recent data suggests that children with particular gene expression profiles in sepsis have
increased likelihood of mortality when treated with corticosteroids.
 SHIPSS (Stress Hydrocortisone In Pediatric Septic Shock) is a prospective, randomized,
double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial examining the potential benefits and risks of adjunctive
hydrocortisone prescribed to critically ill children with fluid and vasoactive-inotropic refractory
septic shock. Up to 1,032 children will be enrolled, randomized, and evaluated at baseline,
PICU discharge, and 28 and 90 days following study enrollment/randomization.
 The primary hypothesis is that hydrocortisone, compared to placebo, will decrease the
proportion of subjects with poor outcomes, defined as death or severely impaired (≥25%
decrease from baseline) health-related quality of life. We will also follow subjects to detect side
effects of the treatment. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that biomarker-based prognostic and
predictive enrichment strategies can improve our ability to identify which children with septic
shock are more likely to benefit from adjunctive hydrocortisone, and which may be harmed. This
randomized control trial will have a significant impact on public health by providing the
heretofore missing evidence to inform guidelines regarding therapy for septic shock in children."

10767341,"Abstract
Gram-negative bacteria use acyl-homoserine lactone mediated quorum sensing to regulate key physiological
activities that includes virulence, biofilm formation and toxin production. AHL synthases make AHL
autoinducer signals by enzymatically coupling acyl-ACP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine metabolites to
facilitate quorum sensing for the bacterium. Therefore, AHL synthase inhibitors hold significant promise as
antimicrobials in treating multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Designing AHL synthase specific inhibitors,
however, does remain a significant challenge. To develop QS selective inhibitors, we investigate unique
functional aspects of AHL synthases that distinguish them from other enzymes utilizing either acyl-ACP or
SAM substrates. One such unique aspect of the synthase is it’s ability to selectively bind and react with a
specific acyl-ACP substrate thereby enforcing fidelity in AHL signal synthesis. In general, acyl-ACP binding
to a partner enzyme is a minimal two-step process involving an initial electrostatic docking of ACP acidic
residues on to a basic patch in the synthase (protein-protein binding) followed by the translocation of the acyl-
chain cargo from the ACP to the enzyme’s active site pocket through a process referred to as “chain-flipping”.
Decoupling the binding from the chain-flipping step was not possible until now due to lack of methods that
could independently report on the chain flipping step in ACP utilizing enzyme reactions. To address this
limitation, we placed a site-specific fluorescent label on the EsaI AHL synthase, conducted enzyme-ACP
titrations in the pre-steady state kinetics regime using a stopped flow fluorometer and determined kon and koff
for both fluorescent and non-fluorescent cargo chain flipping from ACP to the EsaI synthase. Building upon
our preliminary data, we propose two aims in this application to validate a fluorescence based method for
determining chain-flipping rate constants in AHL synthase enzymes. Successful completion of the proposed
studies should a) enhance our understanding on the mechanistic basis of substrate recognition in AHL
synthases b) aid in development of a fluorescence-based HTS assay for screening AHL synthase inhibitors
and c) open doors for single molecule enzymological investigations on chain-flipping step in AHL synthesis
and d) facilitate deployment of this tool to investigate chain-flipping kinetics over a broader range of
medicinally important, carrier protein dependent enzymes.

10792925,"SUMMARY
Immunotherapies have shifted the paradigm for cancer treatment in the past decade. Among them, therapeutic
cancer vaccines, consisting of tumor antigens and adjuvants for activating antigen presenting cells (e.g., dendritic
cells (DCs)), have shown the promise to elicit persistent humoral and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response,
but are limited by the modest therapeutic benefit. Hurdles for developing potent cancer vaccines include the lack
of available tumor antigens and sub-optimal modulation of DCs. Tumor-derived exosomes, the nano-sized
extracellular vesicles secreted by tumor cells, are a good source of tumor antigens and have been widely
explored as cancer vaccines in preclinical studies and clinical trials. However, the antitumor efficacy is far from
satisfactory, likely as a result of poor CTL response. The incorporation of adjuvants that can bind to the toll like
receptors on DC membrane and thus activate DCs has become standard practice for improving conventional
vaccines, but simple mixing with adjuvants has failed to enhance the antitumor efficacy of tumor exosome
vaccines. The primary goal of this project is to develop a strategy that can well integrate tumor exosomes and
adjuvants for the development of potent tumor exosome vaccines. To achieve this, we utilize a metabolic glycan
labeling approach to label glycoproteins and glycolipids on the membrane of cancer cells with chemical tags
(e.g., azido groups), and hypothesize that exosomes secreted by these labeled cancer cells will carry chemical
tags on the surface. The chemically tagged tumor exosomes can covalently capture adjuvants and other
immunomodulatory agents via efficient and bioorthogonal click chemistries, potentially resulting in improved
activation and antigen presentation of DCs and enhanced CTL response. This project will be organized around
two specific aims. In Aim 1, metabolic glycan labeling of various types of cancer cells for the generation of azido-
labeled exosomes will be explored. Two hypotheses will be tested in this aim: (1) azido-labeled tumor cells can
secrete azido-labeled exosomes; (2) the azido groups on the surface of exosomes can efficiently conjugate
dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-molecules via click chemistry. In Aim 2, adjuvant-conjugated tumor exosomes will
be explored as therapeutic cancer vaccines, with the resulting CTL response and antitumor efficacy evaluated
in murine breast cancer and glioblastoma models. Tumor exosomes conjugated with both adjuvants and DC-
targeting ligands (e.g., anti-DEC205) will also be developed and evaluated. Successful completion of the
proposed studies not only will provide a generalizable technology to generate chemically tagged exosomes from
tumor cells for tracking and targeting purposes, but will also result in the development of potent tumor exosome
vaccines with great potential for clinical translation."
11080749,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a common and aggressive cancer. In recent years, despite significant
effort to understand the pathobiology of the disease, there has been only marginal improvement in patient
prognosis. Radiation is one of the chief treatment modalities for OSCC, but radiation resistance has led to a high
incidence of locoregional failure and tumor recurrence. Radiation is incredibly cytotoxic and has the potential to
completely annihilate tumors via induction of lethal double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. To adequately exploit
the benefits of radiation and improve patient outcomes, a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms
of radiation resistance is essential. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the main repair pathway for radiation-
induced DSBs. The high incidence of locoregional failure and tumor recurrence after radiation is likely a reflection
of efficient repair. Therefore, a keen understanding of how NHEJ occurs is vital to developing novel strategies to
increase radiation sensitivity. Our laboratory identified thyroid hormone receptor interacting protein 13 (TRIP13)
as an oncogenic ATPase that promotes NHEJ and radiation resistance in OSCC. The goal of this study is to
delineate the molecular mechanism of TRIP13-mediated NHEJ that enhances radiation resistance. Pilot data
show that phosphorylation of TRIP13 is essential for radioresistance. Moreover, loss of the ATPase activity of
TRIP13 sensitizes OSCC to radiation; ATPases are frequently involved in assembly of biological complexes.
Therefore, the central hypothesis of the proposed study is that phosphorylation-induced ATPase activity of
TRIP13 is necessary for DNA-PK complex formation in NHEJ, thereby promoting radiation resistance in OSCC.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) to explore the extent to which phosphorylation
of TRIP13 promotes NHEJ via induction of its ATPase activity; 2) to investigate the extent to which the ATPase
activity of TRIP13 promotes radiation resistance and 3) to validate pTRIP13 as a predictive marker of radiation
resistance. To address these aims, we will engineer genetically modified cell lines to dissect the mechanism of
radiation resistance in vitro and in in vivo. These aims will elucidate the molecular mechanism behind TRIP13-
mediated radiation resistance and will investigate phospho-TRIP13 as a novel predictive marker of radiation
resistance."

Ectopic expression of transcription factors (TFs) can drive differentiation of embryonic stem cells, trans-
differentiation between different somatic cell lineages, and reprogramming of somatic cells into induced
pluripotent stem cells. This observation underscores the central role transcriptional factors (TFs) play in gene
regulatory networks to dictate cellular phenotypes. The endogenous activities of TFs can be dramatically
altered through mechanisms such as alternative splicing of TF messenger RNAs, in which multiple, functionally
distinct protein isoforms can be produced from the same gene. Distinct TF isoforms can exhibit differential
abilities to bind DNA targets, cofactors, or chromatin-associated proteins, resulting in complementary or
opposing functions. For example, FOXP1 produces two isoforms that differ in their DNA-binding specificities:
one activates self-renewal pathways, while the other activates differentiation pathways. On a global scale, such
isoform-driven functional rewiring is emerging as a major regulatory strategy that controls differentiation and
development. However, reliably detecting and discovering biologically relevant TF isoforms is challenging,
particularly at the proteome-scale.
To characterize TF isoforms that play a role in stem cell differentiation, my lab will apply a powerful combination
of analytical and systems biology approaches to identify and experimentally characterize the functional
consequences of TF isoforms. This project will involve several interlinked areas, including goals to: 1) discover
and quantify full-length TF isoforms associated with differentiated cell states, 2) find TF isoform “drivers” of
differentiation, and 3) uncover the mechanism(s) by which TF isoforms exhibit different functions. Our approach
will use proteogenomic analysis that integrates long-read sequencing and MS-based proteomics data, high-
throughput functional screening of large-scale isoform libraries, and characterization of molecular determinants
(e.g., protein binding, DNA binding) and activities (gene activation or repression) that underlie differential TF
isoform function. Collectively, the resulting data will enable discoveries of new general mechanisms of cellular
differentiation and their drivers.
This research program will provide a fundamental understanding of how TF isoforms function in regulatory
networks and will contribute to the field by expanding the toolkit of TFs used in stem cell engineering applications.
More broadly, this framework offers a new paradigm to enable isoform-resolved biological investigations, which
could accelerate discovery of key isoform regulators in physiological and pathological states."

Progress in translational immunology has created a new demand for training scientists with expertise in human
immunology and with the skills to bring discoveries in immune sciences to the clinic. The training that is
required for translational immunology is distinct from traditional cellular or molecular immunology or the clinical
sciences. This program fulfills four unmet needs in training translational immunologists. First, our
understanding of basic immunology has largely been driven by primary observations and concept development
in animal models, but there are many differences between immune responses in rodents versus humans.
Studies of human cells and tissues are needed to understand the mechanisms of human diseases and predict
outcomes in human clinical settings. Animal models are limited in their ability to accurately model genetic
variations and environmental influences that can affect the human immune system. Second, the methods used
to analyze data from human studies, such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics, are more complex
and variable than data generated from animal model systems. Third, there are still common diseases for which
immune modulation and immune mechanisms are just beginning to be identified and explored such as
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Furthermore, an understanding of
individual features that determine immunologic responses - why some patients do not respond positively, or
even respond negatively, to many current immune-based approaches while others show robust responses, is
only beginning to be elucidated. Lastly, there is a critical shortage of clinically trained investigators who also
have training in basic aspects of human immunology. Those with a clinical background who wish to pursue
further studies in translational immunology are discouraged from this pathway because of their limited previous
training and unfamiliarity with new technologies. To this end, we propose the establishment of the Yale Human
and Translational Immunology (HTI) Training Program (HTITP). The HTITP has grown from the expansion of
the HTI program at Yale, the strong interest among trainees, and the unmet need for skilled translational
immunologists in the scientific community. The program will offer training in concepts and techniques
fundamental to productive human-based research in immunology and includes the newer areas of systems
immunology, precision medicine and host:environment interactions, as well cellular and molecular immunologic
studies. The mentors for this training program cover multiple disciplines, are active leaders in studies of human
immunity in health and disease, have expertise in clinical and translational studies utilizing patient samples,
and are skilled at training predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. We request 4 predoctoral slots, working
toward a PhD degree at Yale, and 3 postdoctoral slots. Yale is an exceptional research environment with state-
of-the-art resources for trainees. The proposed program will provide the tools and investigative experiences to
train the future leaders in the field of translational immunology."
10764942,"Cell migration is a critically important process in key biological events such as tissue morphogenesis, immune response, and cancer metastasis. Directional migration of multiple cell types depends on the dense actin network that rapidly forms at the cell leading edge and facilitates its protrusion via polarized elongation of the actin filaments. Our published studies revealed two novel interconnected determinants of the function of actin at the cell leading edge: actin's nucleotide coding sequence and actin arginylation. Using integrated approaches that combine protein biochemistry, cell biology, and mouse transgenesis, work from my lab demonstrated that arginyltransferase (ATE1), the enzyme that arginylates proteins, specifically regulates the function of actin during cell migration and contributes to virtually every physiologic process involving long-range migration and tissue remodeling in mice. These studies drive my research program, which aims to characterize the novel mechanisms of actin regulation by nucleotide coding sequence and arginylation. Our recent data show that N-terminal arginylation of the leading edge actin is a dynamic event that exhibits a rapid response to extracellular stimuli and is essential for maintaining cell migration speed. Moreover, arginylation is highly specific to the ubiquitous and essential β-actin isoform but not to the closely homologous γ-actin in the same cell types. Remarkably, this specificity is determined at the nucleotide level by the mRNA coding sequence, which is responsible for the differential translation rates of different actin isoforms, exerting downstream effects on their folding rates and co-translational ubiquitination. This novel actin regulatory mechanism targets incorrectly arginylated actin isoforms for degradation and ensures that only the fast­ accumulating β-actin becomes arginylated in cells. Thus, actin arginylation at the cell leading edge is a tightly regulated process that is genetically encoded in its nucleotide sequence, suggesting that arginylation is the primary level of actin regulation that occurs prior to any other actin-dependent event. Uncovering the essential steps of this regulation in actin function and coordination of cell migration in vivo constitutes my long-term research goal."

Progressive apraxia of speech (PAOS) is a devastating neurodegenerative syndrome that ultimately shortens
lifespan and is most commonly due to an Alzheimer’s disease related disorders (ADRD) four-repeat tauopathy.
Nine years ago, we described two distinct subtypes of PAOS: phonetic PAOS characterized predominantly by
articulatory distortions and prosodic PAOS characterized predominantly by slow speech rate and abnormal
prosody. In the 1st cycle we demonstrated that speech, language, and neurological features differ across
PAOS subtypes which helped to validate these subtypes as being distinct. We performed cross-sectional
analyses including voxel-based morphometry of structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging and 18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) and found evidence for greater cortical involvement in phonetic PAOS.
Leveraging autopsy data, we also demonstrated that the PAOS subtypes are associated with specific 4-repeat
tauopathies (phonetic with corticobasal degeneration and prosodic with PSP) and have neuronal loss in distinct
cortico-striatal and pallido-nigro-luysial-cerebellar regions. However, there are still many gaps in knowledge.
Little is known about progression, and whether longitudinal rates of clinical progression differ in PAOS
subtypes, whether anatomic and metabolic rates differ and can be detected with advanced neuroimaging
techniques, and whether genetic and histopathologic features of iron, Alzheimer disease neuropathologic
changes or other co-pathologies play any role in PAOS subtypes. In the 2nd cycle we will proceed in new
directions to address these knowledge gaps and limitations using data collected from 120 PAOS patients
including 47 patients from the 1st cycle. In Aim 1, we will determine whether rates of decline in speech and
other communication features, including acoustic characteristics derived from a novel rate modulation task, or
time to the development of clinical outcomes, are associated with subtype. This aim will be critical to aid
diagnosis and prognostication of disease progression. In Aim 2, we will determine whether advanced and
novel neuroimaging techniques can detect regional longitudinal differences and whether imaging differences
correlate with differences in clinical change over time, across PAOS subtypes. We will analyze structural MRI,
FDG-PET and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to assess volume, metabolism, and iron deposition.
This aim will improve understanding of how differential involvement of these regions relate to PAOS subtypes
and provide specific neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis and disease tracking which is also important for
clinical trials. In Aim 3, we will determine the relationship between tau- and Alzheimer disease related genetic
risk alleles, regional iron burden, Alzheimer disease neuropathologic changes, and other co-pathologies, and
PAOS subtype. Results from this aim will improve our understanding of the neurobiology of PAOS subtype.
Achieving the aims of the 2nd cycle will have significant clinical relevance to every speech-language pathologist
and neurologist who diagnose and care for patients with speech and language disorders."

Work under previous support has broadened our understanding of the factors that influence the catalytic activity
of thrombin and set the stage for a structure-based characterization of how this enzyme interacts with
physiological substrates. Unraveling the architecture of factors involved in blood coagulation remains a
challenging task because of the difficulty of obtaining high resolution structures for proteins containing multiple
domains. We have recently shown how to address this challenge by using cryo-EM, the new gold standard for
the structural investigation of biological macromolecules. The proposed research project is a segue to our
pioneering cryo-EM structural work on human coagulation factors V and Va free and bound to factor Xa in the
prothrombinase complex and the structure of this complex bound to prothrombin. Specifically, we plan to solve
the cryo-EM structures of factor V in complex with thrombin (aim 1) and its active precursor meizothrombin (aim
2) with the goal of revealing the molecular basis of a key step of the initiation phase of the coagulation response
that leads to assembly of the prothrombinase complex. The proposal is supported by exciting preliminary cryo-
EM maps currently refined at 6.6 Å resolution for the thrombin-factor V complex (aim 1) and 3.8 Å resolution for
the meizothrombin-fV complex (aim 2). Once fully refined, these structures will reveal the distinct modes of
binding of thrombin and meizothrombin at preferred sites of activation and the full architecture of meizothrombin
for the first time. Underlying epitopes will be validated independently by mutagenesis of specific residues of
thrombin, meizothrombin and factor V. In addition, the structures will test the hypothesis that binding of thrombin
and meizothrombin to factor V rigidifies the disordered B domain and visualizes the structural determinants that
keep factor V in its inactive state. Success of the proposed studies will significantly advance our basic knowledge
on factor V and its activation in ways that are directly relevant to other multidomain proteins in the blood
coagulation cascade and that may benefit the development of new therapeutic strategies."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The incidence of
T1D is rising, especially in young children. Although significant progress has been made to predict who is at risk
for developing T1D, there are no effective therapies to prevent this disease. Both genetic and environmental
factors contribute to the risk of developing T1D. Certain major histocompatibility complex/human leukocyte
antigen (MHC/HLA) class II haplotypes dominantly protect against the development of T1D, and we recently
discovered that protective MHCII molecules shape early-life microbial communities which in turn impact immune
system development to prevent T1D. Modeling microbial protection from T1D in NOD mice may provide critical
insights to support our long-term goal of developing microbiota-based therapies to prevent T1D in humans. Due
to the complexity and high levels of variability of the intestinal microbiome, determining the specific microbial
strains that drive immune system development and function is problematic. The development of gnotobiotic mice
with defined adult microbial communities has been an important advance in the field because they simplify the
complexity and variability of the system and allow for well-controlled, mechanistic studies. However, a gnotobiotic
mouse model to study pediatric disease is lacking. We developed a new gnotobiotic mouse model of the early-
life microbiome which we call Pediatric Community or “PedsCom”. PedsCom is a consortium of 9 bacterial
strains isolated from the intestine of pre-weaning diabetes-protected Eα16/NOD mice. Remarkably, this 9-
microbe community robustly induces regulatory T cells (Tregs) and confers protection from T1D to diabetes-
susceptible NOD mice. We hypothesize that specific PedsCom microbes work in concert to prevent T1D
by providing microbial antigens and metabolites that induce peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs) during
a critical early life window of immune system development. Aim 1 examines the timing, localization, and
metabolites produced by specific PedsCom members which drive pTreg cell development and prevent
autoimmunity. Aim 2 examines the mechanisms by which pTregs are induced by PedsCom microbes and their
protein antigens and whether pTregs whose TCRs recognize specific microbial antigens mediate protection from
T1D. Successful completion of these aims will provide critical information on which early-life microbes induce
pTregs, and the degree to which microbial antigens and metabolites work together to generate a diabetes-
protective immune system. In addition, PedsCom mice are an innovative tool for investigating early-life host-
microbiota interactions."

Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, cognitive, and
psychiatric manifestations resulting from abnormal protein deposition and neurotransmitter deficits. The
variability in clinical presentation and progression likely reflects different PD subtypes, which may be associated
with the underlying variability in brain pathology. Although current treatments provide dramatic motor benefit in
PD, they fail to alleviate some aspects of gait impairment and non-motor symptoms and may exacerbate
cognitive and psychiatric features. To develop more personalized interventions to treat, forestall or prevent these
features, more information regarding PD subtypes is necessary for patient selection and stratification, predicting
progression, and evaluation of novel treatments. Therefore, we propose to examine the clinical and prognostic
utility of PD subtypes and their stability through longitudinal behavioral assessments; determine the biological
markers of PD subtypes from multimodal neuroimaging, CSF, and brain autopsy data; and translate the PD
subtypes to a clinical setting."

Prior to COVID-19, over 150,000 Americans survived Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) each year.
To date, more than 500,000 Americans have survived COVID-19 ARDS. At least half of ARDS survivors have
persistent muscle weakness that results in increased disability, healthcare costs, and mortality. There are no
targeted therapies to improve muscle strength and physical recovery in ARDS survivors, because the
mechanisms underlying these physical impairments and poor recovery are not well understood. The overall
hypothesis of the project is that multi-systemic dysregulation that occurs in acute ARDS, persists after hospital
discharge in those with persistent physical impairment, and resolves in those who recover physically. The overall
objective of the project is to determine whether persistent inflammation from dysregulated monocytes, anabolic
hormone deficiencies, and muscle mitochondrial dysfunction at 3 months after hospital discharge are each
treatment targets for physical disability in ARDS survivors. To achieve our objective, we will conduct a nested
case-control study of cohorts. We will prospectively enroll 345 ARDS survivors at hospital discharge with 12-
month longitudinal follow-up from Johns Hopkins University and Columbia University hospitals. Three months
after hospital discharge, we will conduct an in-person nested case-control study of 180 ARDS survivors, with
case status defined as not-recovered from new disability. Inflammation, anabolic hormone deficiencies, and
muscle mitochondrial dysfunction increase with aging and comorbidity, and older adult ARDS survivors are less
likely to recover than those who are younger and healthier. Therefore, to determine biomarker levels and muscle
mitochondrial dysfunction that are associated with ARDS, independent of age or comorbidity, we will compare
ARDS survivors with carefully matched community-dwelling adults from the National Heart Lung and Blood
Institute (NHLBI) Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and the Columbia University Merritt Center
muscle biobank. Across the cohorts, we have carefully coordinated sociodemographic, clinical, and functional
assessments to facilitate careful matching. We will conduct rigorous serum biomarker assessments, targeted
plasma metabolomics, high dimensional flow cytometry of blood, and muscle biopsy mitochondrial function and
gene expression analyses to accomplish our three Aims: (1) to determine the role of monocyte function in
recovery from disability in ARDS survivors; (2) to determine the role of anabolic hormone deficiencies in recovery
from disability in ARDS survivors; and (3), to determine how plasma biomarkers of mitochondrial myopathy
associate with skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and recovery from disability in ARDS survivors. The
overall goal is to conduct epi-mechanistic studies that will inform future post-ARDS randomized trials of targeted
anti-inflammatory therapies, hormone supplementation therapies, and muscle mitochondrial therapies that aim
to improve physical function in ARDS survivors, a NHBLI research priority."

The Institute of Medicine’s report on “The health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and transgender People,” called for
NIH-supported research to address the methodological challenges that have impeded research on the health
of transgender people – specifically, to improve strategies for reaching, larger, more diverse samples of
transgender persons in the United States. Historically, research on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) has
excluded or misclassified transgender, nonbinary, and intersex (TNBI) people due to presumptions that
pregnancy and related outcomes can be experienced solely by cisgender women. However, TNBI people plan
for and carry pregnancies, and thus require high-quality and evidence-based healthcare. Despite this need,
existing data on the SRH needs of TNBI populations primarily come from convenience samples-- small in size
and/or limited in geographic scope. The dearth of representative data has meant, critically, that SRH providers
do not have adequate evidence upon which to rely to ensure that the SRH needs of their TNBI patients are met
within existing healthcare services--thereby contributing to lower quality care and SRH disparities among these
populations. And while data on transgender and nonbinary people are scarce, data on intersex people are
even scarcer. Consequently, this study aims to test methods of improving the research participation, retention,
and quality of collected data among TNBI people in the United States. The specific aims include: (1) recruit a
large, diverse sample of TNBI people from across the United States, (2) collect longitudinal data on core SRH
outcomes, and (3) improve retention and data quality among TNBI participants in SRH research as compared
to standard methods. To achieve these aims, we will implement a four-arm, parallel design, randomized control
trial that randomizes participants to receipt of zero, one, or two novel survey features in their online survey: a
gender-inclusive anatomical organ inventory for screening into survey logic, and/or customizable survey
language to personalize their survey experience. The control group will be randomized to screening based on
a 2-part gender identity question, and use of standard medical terms. The research will address challenges
encountered in previous SRH research with TNBI populations and will contribute to the evidence around best
practices for data collection with other populations historically characterized as “hard-to-reach” in the context of
SRH, public health research, and clinical care. The evidence generated by this study could have wide-ranging
impacts—including refined determination of research and clinical care eligibility, improved research
participation, and better healthcare screening and treatment for TNBI populations. Beyond SRH and advancing
the evidence-based for TNBI people, this novel survey methodologies tested in this study could be applied
broadly to advance public health research approaches and improve the accuracy and relevance of data
collection with a diverse range of populations and topics."

Decades of research have revealed that intestinal bacteria are critical for regulating homeostatic and protective
immune responses. However, recent studies suggest that additional players such as fungi and viruses have high
potential to influence these processes. While important trans-kingdom relationships between gut fungi
(mycobiota) and bacteria have been recently unveiled, how fungi influence intestinal homeostasis, states of
inflammation and responses to therapeutic interventions for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is still less clear.
In prior works, we defined profound effects of gut mycobiota on local and gut distal immunity through interaction
with CX3CR1+ mononuclear phagocyte or by shaping host antibody repertoires that influence fungal
commensalism. We defined that these processes are affected in IBD. In a multicenter placebo-controlled clinical
trial of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in Ulcerative colitis (UC) we recently determined that fungal
clearance and blunted immune activation against Candida albicans correlates with a response to therapy. These
findings suggest a possible role of gut mycobiota in efficacy of and response to therapeutic interventions. In
preliminary studies we demonstrate the presence of rich genetic and phenotypic diversity of opportunistic
Candida strains that dominated the colonic mucosa of IBD patients. We found that these isolates differ by their
ability to cause host cell damage and are functionally diverse across individuals. In this competitive renewal we
propose studies aiming to decipher the processes on inflammation caused by patient-associated strains. We
hypothesize that these organisms influence inflammation and response to therapy through the production of
factors that are regulated at strain-specific level. The results of this study will map the human gut mycobiota
functionally and might provide a basis for targeted novel therapies and co-therapies for inflammatory diseases."
10788445,"This project, “Role of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) in Herpes Simplex Virus
(HSV) Encephalitis”, aims to define the precise contribution of RIPK3 to Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)-1
pathogenesis by using the experimental Herpes Simplex Encephalitis (HSE) model. We have found that RIPK3
kinase-dependent necroptosis restricts HSV-1 replication in human cells as well as mouse cells. The attenuation
of HSV-1 propagation in mice was attributed to RIPK3-mediated necroptosis in current literature. Little
information is available about the precise contribution of RIPK3 toward onset and development of the life-
threatening virus-induced encephalitis. Using a well-accepted mouse model of HSE and unique knock-in/out
mice, we have now obtained new evidence suggesting that RIPK3 restricts HSV-1-induced encephalitis via a
RIPK3-necroptosis independent scaffolding function in the central nervous system (CNS), which requires
caspase 8 function. The mechanism through which RIPK3 collaborates with caspase 8 to restrict HSE will be
determined over the course of the project. Two complementary and interrelated research directions will be
pursued. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that HSV1 infection drives RIPK3 activation of caspase 8-
mediated apoptosis in microglia to restrict pathogenesis of HSV1-induced encephalitis. Specific Aim 2 will test
the hypothesis that RIPK3 scaffolding function coordinates protective neuroinflammation and dictates antiviral
immune response to restrict pathogenesis of HSV1-induced encephalitis. Ultimately, we expect to (1) establish
that RIPK3 scaffolding function, by collaborating with caspase 8, is important for HSE restriction rather than the
kinase activity, and (2) show that RIPK3 regulates brain inflammation via stimulation of key proinflammatory
cytokines/chemokines. The studies proposed herein are intended to fill a major existing knowledge gap in our
understanding of the RIPK3 and the pathogenesis of HSE. The impact on the field of HSE will include
establishing fundamental mechanisms of targeting RIPK3 signaling therapeutically towards diagnosing,
preventing, and/or treating this life-threatening virus-induced encephalitis in human settings."
10837075,"Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are two neurodegenerative
diseases characterized by cognitive impairments that include executive dysfunction, visual-spatial processing
difficulties and impaired working memory. Cognitive impairments are among the most debilitating symptoms of
these diseases, often leading to institutionalization and severe decline in health. In PD, cognitive symptoms are
often present at diagnosis, but can appear over the course of the disease. In DLB, cognitive changes appear
first followed by the development of motor parkinsonism. Both diseases, collectively termed Lewy body
dementias, are pathologically characterized by aggregates containing the protein α-synuclein, called Lewy
pathology. Lewy pathology is found in brain areas important for cognition including the cortex and
hippocampus where it correlates with cognitive decline. Genetic variations in the gene, GBA1, also associate
with LBDs. GBA1 encodes for glucocerebrosidase an enzyme that metabolizes glucosylceramide. Mutations in
glucocerebrosidase reduce its enzyme activity. Up to 12% of PD cases involved genetic variations in GBA1.
The GBA1L444P mutation, which represents about 35% of all PD-GBA1 mutations, increases risk of cognitive
decline in PD by 5X. We have found that mice heterozygous for GBA1L444P show impaired performance in
behavioral tasks of hippocampal function, and reduced synaptic markers in the hippocampus but not other
brain regions. In addition, GBA1L444P heterozygous mice injected with pre-formed α-synuclein fibrils to induce
formation of inclusions from endogenous α-synuclein, show more abundant inclusions in the hippocampus
compared to wild type mice. In addition, we and others have found that the lipid, glucosylsphingosine but not
glucosylceramide is increased in GBA1L444P heterozygous mice, suggesting this lipid causes pathology and
should be the target of PD-GBA1 therapies. The combined impact of increased GlcSph and enhanced α-syn
aggregation in the hippocampus could be a mechanism by which cognition is impaired in LBDs, which will be
explored in this proposal. First, we will determine if glucosylsphingosine is elevated in brain tissue from
individuals with PD-GBA1 and controls. We will also utilize a model of human α-synuclein aggregation to
determine if pathologic α-synuclein causes changes in glycosphingolipid metabolism in hippocampal and
cortical brain regions. Because reduced glucocerebrosidase has been shown to impair lysosome function, we
will use primary hippocampal neurons to determine if glucosylsphingosine impairs lysosome activity, leading to
a build-up of abnormal α-synuclein. Finally, we will use independent methods to reduce GlcSph in GBA1
L444P heterozygous and wild type mice with and without α-synuclein pathology to determine if decreasing this
lipid prevents defects in hippocampal physiology and related behaviors. Overall, this project will help determine
mechanisms by which GBA1L444P contributes to cognitive decline and help identify therapeutic strategies to
prevent development of cognitive symptoms."

Background: Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. While the potential
mechanisms of glaucomatous injury are incompletely understood, it is clear that the incidence of
glaucoma increases with age and with intraocular pressure (IOP). Several biomechanical studies
have indicated that the sclera is a critical mediator of the biomechanical response of the optic
nerve head (ONH) to changes in IOP, showing a significant progressive stiffening with aging in
the regions around the ONH (peripapillary sclera) most susceptible to glaucomatous injury. While
prior studies have provided valuable insight into the role of IOP, cerebrospinal fluid pressure,
blood pressure, and structural stiffness of the ONH and lamina cribrosa , as determinants of the
ONH‘s mechanical environment, the role of the vitreous humor, filling the space between ONH-
retina and lens, has still not been investigated as being part of the ONH’s environment.
Significantly, the vitreous undergoes progressive structural degeneration with aging showing
increasing liquid and decreasing gel volumes throughout life that impairs its viscoelastic
properties. We therefore propose that such an age-related vitreous degeneration along scleral
stiffening is determinant to ONH biomechanics. The Objectives of this study are: 1) to determine
the impact of vitreous in modulating the biomechanical scleral response during dynamic IOP
variations in human donor eyes; 2) To determine how scleral response can be biomechanically
improved with a biomimetic designed hydrogel. Design: In a group of 20 human donor eyes over
age of 40, we will measure the sclera’s response during physiological IOP variations induced in
the anterior chamber. We will compare the scleral biomechanics in four conditions of the vitreous
chamber: i) with the natural vitreous, ii) after replacing the liquid part of the vitreous with saline,
iii) after replacing the remaining vitreous gel with saline, iv) and after replacement with a
biomimetic hydrogel designed to match the viscoelastic properties of young vitreous. Impact:
Elucidating the complex mechanical relationship between the sclera and vitreous will not only
inform and improve mechanistic models of glaucoma, it will also provide a potential translational
mechanism to develop novel approaches to attenuate the mechanical insult caused by dynamic
IOP variations on the ONH. This project will be the first to define this relationship, filling a scientific
gap. Vitreous replacement based on the ONH-sclera response can be further explored in clinical
longitudinal studies and animal models based on the data obtained herein.

AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast signaling between neurons and contribute to high
cognitive processes. Since AMPA receptors are also implicated in numerous neurological disorders, including
Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, and ischemia, the ability to regulate them

activity in pathological conditions, which highlights a profound gap in our knowledge of AMPA receptor
structure and function. Our long-term goal is to understand how AMPA receptor molecular machinery operates
at the atomic level. We plan to study AMPA receptor structure and function using single-particle cryo-electron
microscopy (cryo-EM). Advances in cryo-EM that were signified by the “resolution revolution” brought us a
number of AMPA receptor structures in different gating conformations and in complex with several small
molecules and regulatory proteins. Nevertheless, only a little fraction of AMPA receptor conformational states
and binding partners have been characterized structurally and the resolution of the reported structures remains
relatively low, limiting our ability to see the atomic details. We, therefore, plan to use cryo-EM advances to fill
up this knowledge gap and to focus on the following Specific Aims: (1) unravel structural principles of AMPA
receptor regulation by auxiliary subunits, (2) reveal molecular determinants of AMPA receptor activation and
conductance, and (3) determine molecular mechanisms of AMPA receptor desensitization. To reach our
research goals, we will use cryo-EM to obtain structures of AMPA receptors alone or in complex with different
auxiliary proteins, in the presence of agonists, competitive antagonists, positive or negative allosteric
modulators, and in conditions favoring various conformational states. We will use Fluorescence-detection Size
Exclusion Chromatography (FSEC) and thermostability assays to assess protein expression, assembly,
homogeneity, and stability. We will also employ site-directed mutagenesis combined with single-channel and
whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings to study functional mechanisms and to critically test our
structural models. Reaching our research goals will have a significant impact on understanding the
mechanisms of excitatory neurotransmission and will provide molecular-level knowledge essential to facilitate
the design of new drugs for the treatment of neurological disorders."
10907468,"Childhood brain cancers arise in the context of the developing human brain and have become the leading
causes of cancer-related mortality in children. The golden age of sequencing has provided a wealth of
knowledge regarding the genetic drivers of brain tumors. This knowledge has sparked several clinical trials in a
variety of pediatric tumors such as medulloblastomas, high-grade gliomas and embryonal tumors. However,
therapeutic leads and clinical trials to combat childhood ependymomas have lagged far behind. Therefore,
there is an urgent and unmet need to develop effective therapies for children with ependymomas. Recent
molecular studies have revealed the complex biology of childhood ependymomas influenced by both the
anatomic compartment from which they arise and distinct genetic/ epigenetic tumors drivers. This has led to a
recent molecular classification system that takes both parameters into account. We propose to advanced
precision-medicine for ependymomas by tackling childhood ependymomas that occur in the hemispheric/
supratentorial region of the brain that exhibit the highly recurrent ZFTA-RELA fusion in 80% of cases. Our
strong in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that the ZFTA-RELA fusion tumor cells are reliant on glutamine to
not only support their proliferation, but also help in survival by expanding the capacity of tumor cells to
withstand oxidative insults. Our central hypothesis is that glutamine is a critical metabolic substrate that, via
generation of glutathione, enables maintenance of redox balance in ZFTA-RELA bearing ependymomas.
Consequently, inhibition of glutamine metabolism will be therapeutic by increasing oxidative stress to kill ZFTA-
RELA tumor cells. Accordingly, we propose a research program to define the role of glutamine in ZFTA-RELA
ependymomas. In specific aim 1 we will define the molecular mechanisms by which ZFTA-RELA enhances
glutamine metabolism. We will determine the epigenetic mechanism and the role of fusion partners ZFTA and
RELA in upregulating glutamine metabolism. In specific aim 2, We will define molecular mechanisms by which
glutamine enhances redox resistance in ZFTA-RELA cells. We will also combine glutamine-based positron
emission tomography imaging with carbon-13 isotope labeling to map the fate of glutamine carbons in vivo in
ZFTA-RELA ependymoma animal models. In specific aim 2, we will determine the ability of suppressing
glutamine metabolism as a therapeutic target in vivo. We will also determine if combining inhibition of
glutamine metabolism with standard-of-care radiation therapy enhances therapeutic efficacy. These aims
together will advance the field by defining the molecular mechanisms by which ZFTA-RELA drives cancer in
childhood ependymomas, develop non-invasive, metabolic imaging based biomarkers, and define therapeutic
strategies to combat these deadly pediatric brain tumors."

The accelerating development of novel AD/ADRD therapeutics and efforts to repurpose
commonly prescribed drugs for other chronic conditions foreshadows future opportunities to
reduce AD/ADRD risk and burden. However, the demand for and access to AD/ADRD
therapeutics is uncertain in underserved non-Hispanic Black communities who are at elevated
AD/ADRD risk and face barriers to use that are particularly acute due to factors such as structural
racism and medical system distrust. Members of non-Hispanic Black communities remain under-
included in AD/ADRD research and the limited evidence available demonstrates that non-
Hispanic Black older adults are diagnosed with AD/ADRD later than non-Hispanic White
Americans and are less likely to receive follow-up care, specialist care and available therapeutics
after an AD/ADRD diagnosis. One strategy to facilitate equitable uptake of future AD/ADRD
therapies is to identify and quantify the demand for and access barriers to potential dementia
treatments from non-Hispanic Black stakeholders’ perspectives and actual use of novel therapies
for non-AD/ADRD conditions. In the planning stage, we will engage non-Hispanic Black
stakeholders and employ NIA’s Health Disparities Framework to guide use of qualitive and
quantitative methods to identify and elicit measurement of key factors related to access and
demand for novel and repurposed therapeutics. In the implementation stage, we will collect and
analyze data from study participants and nationally representative data sources. We will quantify
likelihood of drug initiation, adherence, and discontinuation among non-Hispanic Blacks across
therapeutics with varying cost, efficacy, administration, and side-effect profiles. We will employ
the measures using a validated dynamic microsimulation model to quantify the downstream
impact of novel and repurposed therapeutics on health care costs and the cognitive and physical
health and quality of life of non-Hispanic Black men and women. Findings will inform targeted
opportunities for ensuring equitable access to therapeutics that reduce disease risk and burden
in non-Hispanic Black communities and will quantify the health and economic impacts of
therapeutics to inform public spending and drug innovation efforts for improving health outcomes
and achieving equity."
10880271,"AML is the most common acute leukemia in adults, and it appears increasingly with age. Despite overall
improvement in the treatment of leukemia, AML still carries a devastating prognosis for elderly patients (less
than 10% of patients survive for 5 years). Thus, new therapies for AML are necessary. Using a bioinformatics
approach and a whole-genome CRISPR screening approach, we identified regulators of selenium metabolism
to be important for AML survival. Selenium is required for cells to synthesize selenocysteine, which is then used
to produce selenoproteins. Since many selenoproteins are involved in redox regulation, we hypothesized that
selenium metabolism is required for redox maintenance of AML. This hypothesis will be tested in the following
three aims. In aim 1, we will use mouse models that we have generated that have mutations in the genes we
identified in the CRISPR screen to examine the requirement of selenium metabolism in murine AML. In aim 2,
we will use a mouse model that lacks the redox regulator, which we hypothesize to be downstream of the
selenium metabolism pathway, to examine how this redox regulator promotes murine AML. In aim 3, we will
study the mechanisms we discovered in human AML patient-derived xenograft models to examine the
therapeutic potential of inhibiting selenium metabolism in AML. These genetic analyses with both murine and
human AML models should bring novel insights into how AML regulates selenium metabolism and the
therapeutic potential of targeting this mechanism."
10906851,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rural communities in the southern U.S. suffer a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality from
cardiometabolic disease, with traditional risk factors explaining only a modest proportion of the excess burden
of disease. Growing evidence implicates poor sleep health as an important risk factor for cardiometabolic
disease. While this is most well established for sleep apnea and insomnia, there is considerable evidence that
multiple dimensions of sleep health, including sleep duration, efficiency, timing, and regularity, also affect
cardiometabolic disease risk. Moreover, rural Southern communities are likely to experience high rates of
impaired sleep health, reflecting high levels of psychosocial and environmental stressors, such as financial
stress, social isolation, environmental pollution, and poor built environment in addition to high rates of smoking
and obesity. However, there is currently a lack of systematically developed sleep data in rural populations.
Recognizing the paucity of research on cardiometabolic risk in this high-risk rural population, the NHLBI
recently initiated a new longitudinal epidemiology study in rural Appalachia and Mississippi Delta (the RURAL
Study) to identify the complex individual, social and environmental factors contributing to this high burden of
disease. The proposed RURAL Sleep Study will complement the RURAL Study by incorporating minimally
burdensome measures of multiple dimensions of sleep health at the time of baseline cohort assessment in
approximately 4000 adults age 25-64 years, utilizing mobile health technologies to (a) measure sleep apnea
over 4 consecutive nights; (b) measure sleep duration, timing, regularity and fragmentation over multiple
weeks; and (c) administer standardized questionnaires to assess insomnia, chronotype, sleep quality and
sleep-related impairment. These data will allow us to leverage the planned extensive assessments of
cardiometabolic risk factors, subclinical disease, and psychosocial and environmental stressors (and resilience
factors) to address the following specific aims:
Aim 1a. Quantify population distributions of sleep health measures in a rural cohort along dimensions of sleep
apnea, insomnia, chronotype, and sleep duration, efficiency, timing, and regularity.
Aim 1b. Identify psychosocial, behavioral, and environmental correlates of sleep health in rural communities.
Aim 2. Assess the association of sleep health with cardiometabolic risk factors and subclinical cardiovascular
disease independent of other established cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors.
The results are expected to inform health care providers, public health officials, and the general public of the
prevalence, risk factors, and consequences of impaired sleep health in these rural communities, providing a
critical basis for prevention, recognition, and management of sleep disorders and improvement of sleep and
cardiometabolic health."
10907655,"Project Summary/Abstract
The nickel-pincer nucleotide (NPN) cofactor is a recently identified coenzyme discovered in lactate racemase
(LarA) but found more widely in 2-hydroxyacid racemases and epimerases. Synthesis of the cofactor requires
the sequential action of three accessory proteins: LarB carboxylates the pyridinium ring at C5 and hydrolyzes
the phosphoanhydride of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD), LarE is an ATP-dependent enzyme that
converts the two pyridinium ring carboxylates into thiocarboxylates either by sacrificial loss of a protein cysteinyl
sulfur atom or by a mechanism involving a [4Fe-4S] cluster with a non-core sulfide, and LarC inserts nickel
(forming C-Ni and S-Ni bonds) in a CTP-dependent reaction. Gene homologs encoding these four proteins are
widely distributed in microorganisms associated with the human microbiome and among human pathogens. The
long-term objective of the effort described here is to significantly advance our understanding of how
microorganisms, including pathogenic species, make and utilize the NPN cofactor. Two specific aims will
achieve this objective: (1) the components of the NPN biosynthetic pathways will be structurally and
mechanistically characterized and (2) new roles of the NPN cofactor will be characterized beyond its function in
lactate racemase. Investigations of LarB will define the structure of an NaAD- and CO2-bound variant by
crystallography and confirm the formation of a covalent cysteinyl-pyridinium intermediate by stopped-flow UV-
vis spectrophotometry. In vivo analyses will test the cellular ability to reverse the sacrificial loss of cysteinyl sulfur
from one type of LarE. The [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing version of LarE will be structurally characterized by
crystallography. The hypothesis for a third, persulfide-containing form of LarE will be evaluated. The structure
and dynamics of intact LarC will be solved by cryo-electron microscopy. Alternatively, the N-terminal domain of
LarC will be defined by crystallography (complementing the known C-terminal structure) to better delineate the
enzyme’s single-turnover, CTP-dependent mechanism of nickel insertion. Additional LarA homologs will be
structurally and functionally defined. Examples that tightly bind larger substrates will be used to probe open
questions regarding the NPN-dependent enzyme reaction mechanism. Other examples are predicted to contain
both NPN and an iron-sulfur cluster whose function will be investigated. In addition, non-LarA-like proteins that
bind NPN will be identified and characterized. The findings obtained through these efforts will greatly increase
knowledge of the synthesis and utilization of nickel-pincer nucleotide cofactors in bacteria, including those
important to human health, with implications for identifying potential antimicrobial drug targets."
10851835,"The overarching mission of the Center for Social Capital (SoCa) is to bring together academic institutions,
community-based organizations, and a diverse group of stakeholders to reduce cancer health inequities due to
persistent poverty. New York City (NYC) is a region of extremes with some of the richest and poorest living in
close proximity. These extremes have profound impact on health with major inequities in life expectancy with
cancer driving these differences as the number 1 and 2 cause of premature mortality and overall mortality,
respectively. NYC is one of the most diverse in the U.S., with approximately 2/3 non-White, 1/3 foreign-born,
and at least 1/5 living below the Federal poverty line across four counties with persistent poverty. With such
diversity, come challenges with respect to implementing cancer control programs to meet the needs of all.
Using a community-engaged approach, we identified the top three social determinants that exerted the
greatest barriers to early detection and treatment of cancer in communities of persistent poverty were; 1)
financial burden; 2) low health literacy, and 3) community/ social context (i.e., lack of social support/cohesion,
stigma, discrimination).
 NYC has a long history of migration and immigration, which has resulted in racially/ethnically
segregated communities. Residential segregation concentrates disadvantages in minority communities by
limiting social, economic, and educational opportunities and resources while concentrating poverty in these
communities. However, for some segments of the population, especially new immigrants, residing in a highly
segregated community has positive health effects through co-ethnic social support networks also known as
“ethnic enclaves” and resource availability. Hence the constructs of social capital and social cohesion may play
a significant role in mediating the relationship between residential segregation and negative health outcomes,
such as cancer incidence and mortality. Our mission as a Center is to reduce cancer health inequities in
persistent poverty census tracts throughout NYC by promoting multi-generational health. Specifically, we aim
to: Develop a rich interdisciplinary, and collaborative partnership with community organizations that will infuse
stakeholder-engaged research methods and will build sustainable approaches for cancer control (Aim 1);
Conduct two complementary projects that focus on novel interventions in persistent poverty communities
aimed at two structural determinants of health—education and health care—in which the interventions aim to
increase social capital among youth in school settings, and patient navigators in Federally Qualified Health
Centers as a means to alleviate systemic inequities (Aim 2); and leverage capacity across four geographically
separate groups of persistent poverty census tracts in NYC to cultivate the next generation of investigators and
develop sustainable Core infrastructure to achieve cancer health equity (Aim 3)."
10851837,"The Administrative Core (ADMIN) for the Center for Social Capital (SoCa) will be essential for meeting the
Center’s mission to reduce cancer health inequities in persistent poverty areas (PPAs) in the New York City

of Cornell University (CU), Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), and Downstate Health Sciences
University (Downstate), and the regional healthcare systems and networks of New York-Presbyterian (NYP)
Hospital System, NYP Dalio Center for Health Justice, Cornell Center for Health Equity, and New York City

equipped to achieve cancer health equity in PPAs, the SoCa Center has four Cores to support its’ mission:
ADMIN, Career Enhancement Core (CEC), Developmental Core (DC), and Research and Methods Core (RMC).
 The central theme of the SoCa Center revolves around building social capital as a means to alleviate the
impact of systemic factors on health inequities in areas of persistent poverty. We have designed two
complementary projects that focus on novel interventions aimed at two structural determinants of health—
education and health care services (e.g., decreasing the digital divide and linking to cancer control care through
tobacco cessation programs). The ADMIN will oversee, manage, and coordinate the range of activities for the
entire SoCa Center. Within the ADMIN, we will also facilitate the interactions between the investigators involved
in all Center Projects, including the DC pilots, and those led by SoCa Health Scholars, community organizations,
and mentors. The ADMIN will use a coalition approach to support our mission of promoting multigenerational
health and reduce cancer inequities in PPAs. The ADMIN will: (1) centrally manage and coordinate all Center
research and activities to promote synergy and facilitate connections across the Center and will provide
administrative, financial, and scientific support to collaborative research teams across the Center (Aim 1);
monitor research progress and milestones for all Center activities, including all Cores and Projects, and ensure
implementation of the Center Plans through formal feedback and ongoing evaluations (Aim 2); and promote a
community-engaged research agenda, engage early stage investigators in cancer control research, and
disseminate research approaches, methods, findings and opportunities across our NYC Region and through the
larger NCI Persistent Poverty Initiative Network (Aim 3).
 The SoCa Center’s ultimate impact in eliminating health disparities in cancer control in persistent poverty
areas in the NYC Region will come from our collective efforts in developing, and building capacity in training and
research opportunities focused on strategies aimed at multilevel interventions that look beyond those focused
on the individual. The ADMIN will support this mission."

10851843,"The rise in cancer incidence among younger adults (ages 20-39) in NYC is currently outpacing the increase
across the rest of the US (96.9 vs. 89.5 per 100,000). However, the burden of cancer in NYC is not equally
distributed. In NYC's poorest neighborhoods, the rates of preventable cancers, such as cervical cancer, is 73%
higher compared to the wealthiest neighborhoods. The magnitude of this disparity exceeds those associated
with Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, or residence in a rural county documented in a previous population-based
study of the US. Rather, it is likely the persistent poverty in these neighborhoods that drives cancer disparities.
Despite these known facts, there remains limited research on multi-level and multi-generational approaches that
address the impact of persistent poverty on youth and young adults' current and future cancer risk behaviors.
Effective cancer education interventions in schools could significantly impact health-promoting intentions and
cancer risk behaviors in younger adults. To date, most school-based intervention studies have been limited. The
need for this research is especially salient in NYC, the most populous city in the United States, with nearly 2
million New Yorkers under 18. In response to RFA-CA-22-015 Cancer Control Research in Persistent Poverty
Areas, this application in randomize a total of 10 new York City schools (n=906 students) in two waves, over 2
years, to an immediate vs delayed (wait list control) six-week cancer education and social justice intervention
delivered by trained classroom science teachers. The intervention is guided by the Self-Determination and youth
empowerment theory, thus it will leverage the natural desire of youth to be socially conscious, autonomous
individuals who can be effective agents of social change. The intervention aims to: 1) increase students’ intention
to engage in at least one health-promoting behavior (e.g., drink less or no sugary beverages) in the next month
as a predictor of actual behavior change; and 2) increase cancer risk communication between the student and
a parent. Additionally, we will explore the impact of increased cancer risk communication on the health-promoting
behaviors of at least one parent or adult caregiver in the household. Assessments of students will be conducted
at baseline, 6 and 24 weeks. Parents will be assessed 6 weeks after implementation of the curricula and then
again at 24 weeks. If effective, our pragmatic approach provides a framework for integrating a cancer
education intervention with a social justice lens more broadly into NYC public schools, the largest public school
system in the country. This program will have far-reaching effects, empowering adolescents with knowledge
that can not only mitigate future cancer incidence of vulnerable youth but also promote healthier behaviors
within families."
10851849,"Although smoking rates are declining, they remain elevated among individuals impacted by poverty (36%).
Tobacco use remains an important modifiable risk factor for cancer and an urgent public health priority.
Despite elevated smoking rates, low-income smokers have less awareness of, access to, and utilization of
smoking cessation treatments. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), safety-net care settings for the
most vulnerable populations, represent an important yet under-appreciated opportunity for reducing smoking-
related health inequalities. In 2012, 21 million patients, the majority of whom were either uninsured (36%) or
publicly insured (49%), received care at an FQHC. Innovation is needed to increase access to smoking
cessation treatments among low-income smokers treated in FQHC practices serving PPA patients.
 Evidence shows that provider screening, counseling, and pharmacotherapy reduces tobacco use.
However, consistent delivery of provider-led cessation treatments in clinical settings is challenging. State
tobacco quitlines are effective, free or low-cost, and available in all states. Nevertheless, quitline usage is
limited. The Centers for Disease Control recommends proactive strategies for increasing quitline use, including
partnerships with health care centers. Electronic health record-linked patient portals are becoming a standard
part of health care delivery and are a novel approach for proactively linking smokers to Quitlines. Evidence
supports the reach and feasibility of portals for offering population-based interventions. However, prior studies
have not tested implementation strategies for using portals to offer proactive linkage to quitlines.
 Informed by Social Determination Theory, Project 2 will evaluate the implementation of three scalable
strategies, including (1) patient navigation, (2) widely available health information technology (HIT)
infrastructure including the patient portal, for offering proactive linkage of low-income smokers and (3) the New
York State Smoker's Quit Line (NYSSQL). We propose a population-based randomized trial in three FQHCs in
SoCa neighborhoods. First, we will examine the effectiveness of an educational campaign paired with patient
navigation for increasing patient portal enrollment (Aim 1). Next, we will evaluate the reach of the patient portal
as an approach to delivering population-level advice to quit and smoking cessation treatment linkage (Aim 2).
We will compare impact of referral type (opt-in referral vs. self-referral) on linkage to the NYSSQL (Aim 3). Aim
4 will compare the influence of message type (Arm 1 Choice vs. Arm 2 No-Choice in cessation goals) on rates
of linkage to the NYSSQL and receipt of smoking cessation treatment. This project aligns with the SoCa
mission of addressing health disparities in persistent poverty areas by improving health through tobacco
cessation and overall portal health enrollment for future cancer screening outreach and cancer control
measures."
10934323,"ABSTRACT
There is increasing awareness of systematic racism in US health care. Clinical algorithms that include race,
which are often incorporated into electronic health systems meant to facilitate guideline care, are a striking
example of overt and systemic differences in recommended care. Differences in care and reasons for these
differences are often more difficult to identify and address. Colorectal cancer (CRC) care provides a case
study. There is ample evidence of racial disparities in every step of the colorectal cancer care continuum, from
early detection to treatment, especially for differences between Black patients and White patients. Compared
to White people, Black people are less likely to be screened for CRC, less likely to receive endoscopic tests at
high-quality facilities, more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage, less likely to receive curative treatment –
even after accounting for stage at diagnosis, and have 40% higher mortality and shorter stage-specific survival.
These differences in care have both health and economic consequences. In addition to worse outcomes, Black
people have higher CRC-attributable treatment costs. We propose to extend and apply CRC-SPIN, an
established microsimulation model for CRC, to synthesize the available evidence related to racial and ethnic
differences in CRC risk, CRC care, and costs of care. We will extend CRC-SPIN, which currently simulates the
overall US population, to simulate the natural history of CRC among specific racial and ethnic groups
represented in SEER data (American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, White and
Hispanic/non-Hispanic). Extension of CRC-SPIN to include race/ethnicity will focus on incorporating available
information about differences in CRC risk. We will also extend CRC-SPIN to simulate patient characteristics
beyond race/ethnicity that are related to screening, such as insurance status, which mediate the relationship
between race/ethnicity and CRC care. We will use the resulting model to simulate the overall impact of
disparate care on CRC outcomes, and to identify elements of the care process that have the largest impact on
outcomes to better guide health policy. Health outcomes will include life years lost, disease-free life years lost,
excess CRC, and excess late-stage CRC. Financial outcomes will assess societal costs, including screening
costs, treatment costs and lost income both overall and for specific racial/ethnic groups. We will use robust
decision making approaches to address uncertainty in the differential risk of CRC and differential CRC care.
We will use the model to project the impact of policy scenarios designed to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in
CRC to assist in identify the most effective policy scenarios for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in CRC."
10930029,"Abstract. The neural substrates underlying alcohol use disorder (AUD), remain poorly understood in part due
to lack of translational models that recapitulate phenotypes from the human condition. Biosynthesis of the
GABAergic neurosteroid, allopregnanolone (Allo) in corticolimbic neurons, regulates stress sensitivity and
induces a potent anxiolytic action. In a rodent model of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure, decreased
expression of Allo biosynthetic enzymes, 5α-reductase type I (5α-RI) and 3α-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase
(3α-HSD) is associated with Allo level downregulation in the hippocampus (HIP) and cerebellum. Consistently,
in AUD postmortem brain, cerebellum Allo levels and neurosteroidogenic proteins and enzymes, such as the
translocator protein (TSPO), 5α-RI and 3α-HSD expression decreased in association with aberrant epigenetic
marks. Alcohol-induced epigenetic modifications (e.g., DNA hyper/hypomethylation) on transcriptomics and
their impact on neurosteroidogenic gene expression, neurosteroid levels, and anxiety are poorly understood.
Allo biosynthesis can be upregulated in brain areas that modulate anxiety and alcohol reward by stimulating
the epigenetically modifiable nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-regulated receptor (PPAR)-α by the
endogenous modulator, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA). Intriguingly, chronic alcohol exposure decreases PPAR-
α expression, while stimulation of PPAR-α by PEA decreases both anxiety and alcohol intake. The molecular
mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. Our preliminary and published results suggest that
alcohol-induced aberrant regulation of PPAR-α may affect anxiety via decreasing Allo content. Hypothesis:
Chronic alcohol exposure alters methylation/demethylation dynamics that downregulate corticolimbic PPAR-α
expression and allopregnanolone biosynthesis, and elevated anxiety. In male and female rats, we will: (AIM 1)
Examine the effect of 14-day CIE exposure (EtOH), ethanol acute (24h, W24h) and protracted (7 days, W7d)
withdrawal on the epigenetic regulation of PPAR-α expression and downstream effects on neurosteroidogenic
enzyme expression; (AIM 2) Investigate the effects of CIE exposure and ethanol acute and protracted
withdrawal on the brain content of Allo; and (AIM 3) Study the pharmacoepigenetics of PEA and fenofibrate on
Allo biosynthesis and anxiety after CIE exposure and acute and protracted ethanol withdrawal. This study may
unveil CIE-induced neurobiological alterations and suggest treatment targets for alcohol withdrawal symptoms."
10833691,"Project Summary/Abstract
 We will determine the effects of APP and APP proteolytic products on mitophagy and
bioenergetic function. We hypothesize that amyloid precursor protein (APP) facilitates mitophagy through
direct interactions with PINK1 and p62. We further hypothesize that loss of APP expression or reduced
mitochondrial localization affects mitochondrial function through inhibition of mitophagy.
 Metabolic deficiencies are prominent in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A clear relationship between amyloid
precursor protein (APP) and mitochondria is described in the literature but the function of APP at
mitochondria is not well understood.
 APP and Aβ localize to mitochondria and can alter mitochondrial function. Our data show that
mitochondrial membrane potential directly correlates with Aβ production and APP mitochondrial localization.
Under conditions of increased mitophagy APP mitochondrial localization is increased. Our data indicate loss of
APP at mitochondria or loss of APP expression, reduces mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) function
and mitophagy. Overall, our data support a role of APP in modulating mitophagy and bioenergetic flux. A
current gap in our knowledge is if these observations are attributed to full-length APP or APP
processing products. We will address this knowledge gap here.
 A relationship between mitochondria, bioenergetics, mitophagy, and APP is evident. Our data support a
relationship between APP localization at mitochondria, bioenergetic function, and mitophagy. We hypothesize
that loss of APP at mitochondria alters bioenergetic flux (Aim 1) and mitochondrial localized APP
facilitates mitophagy (Aim 2). The overall goal of this study is to understand the role of APP and its
derivatives in mitophagy and bioenergetic flux.
 We will use in vivo and in vitro models across two aims. In vitro models include engineered induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) cells with either wild-type (WT) APP, APP knockout, or mitochondrial localization
incompetent APP (3M APP) expression. Engineered iPSCs will be differentiated to neurons and astrocytes. In
vivo models will include non-transgenic, transgenic WT APP mice and APP knockout mice. Use of both in vivo
and in vitro models allows for elucidation of cell type specific effects (in vitro models) and sex differences (in
vivo).
 We will measure endpoints in the models proposed under native conditions and under conditions where
APP processing is inhibited or increased. We will determine the role of full-length APP versus APP processing
products in mitophagy and bioenergetic flux pathways."
10872329,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current treatments for many musculoskeletal disorders are often suboptimal. Understanding the signals
controlling skeletal homeostasis and repair is of high relevance, since this knowledge is critical for developing
effective therapies for common conditions such as osteoporosis and fractures.
In this proposal, we study fibrous dysplasia (FD) as a way to understand the regulators of human bone formation,
and test if these pathways could then be used to enhance bone repair. FD accounts for 2.5% of all bone lesions
and can occur as part of McCune-Albright Syndrome (MAS). FD is caused by genetic mutations in the GNAS
locus, leading to a constitutively active Gs-GPCR protein, hence increasing cAMP levels and causing aberrant
cellular signaling. Medical treatments for this disfiguring disorder are sorely lacking. This proposal uses new
tools, including mouse models, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), skeletal stem/progenitor cells,
and advanced genetic strategies, to address the critical knowledge gaps and to find novel therapies for these
medically significant conditions. We propose three specific aims:
Aim 1: Identify novel compounds that directly target Gsα-regulated cAMP and Wnt production. We
previously showed that stopping excess Gs-GPCR pathway activity in mice could dramatically reverse FD-like
bone lesions. Using a new artificial intelligence computational approach, we found 71 candidate compounds
predicted to selectively bind the GsαR201H protein. Preliminary studies demonstrate that some of these show the
desired inhibition of GsαR201H-induced basal cAMP production. This Aim takes our top candidates and further
characterizes their ability to block cAMP and Wnt activity, as potential molecular tools for manipulating GNAS.
We also test if the lead compounds can reverse existing FD lesions in mouse calvarial cultures.
Aim 2: Test if Wnt inhibition can prevent FD bone lesions in mice. How the GNAS mutations in FD cause
dramatic bone formation is still poorly defined. We recently found that three proteins, Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt9a,
are upregulated in both mouse and human FD bone lesions. This Aim tests if blocking these proteins can reverse
FD bone lesions in mice, and examines how each Wnt protein impacts FD lesion pathology.
Aim 3: Determine the pathways that are dysregulated in human FD bone lesions and assess the roles of
WNT signaling in human skeletal stem/progenitor cells during fracture repair. This aim uses advanced
genetics on human FD bone samples to identify the malfunctioning cell types that cause FD. We also test how
overactivating WNT4, WNT5a, or WNT9a in human skeletal stem/progenitor cells affect bone formation in a
fracture healing model. These results will identify new targets for treating FD and for promoting fracture healing.
This application address key knowledge gaps about which Wnt signaling molecules drive FD and how they
impact human osteogenesis. The proposal comes from an established, strong, collaborative, multi-institutional
team with extensive experience in GPCRs, FD, bone biology, and bone analytical methods.

10884251,"PAmino acid nutrition is a key determinant in the development of dysmetabolism and chronic disease. Amino acid insufficiency (AAI) reduces growth, but also acts to increase cellular resistance to stress, improve cardiometabolic fitness and slow metabolic aging. A clearer understanding of the molecular events altering the relationship between amino acid nutrition and resilience of the proteome will advance current dietary and pharmaceutical approaches to promote health span and treat dysmetabolic conditions. The integrated stress response (ISR) is a vital sentinel signaling network in proteostasis maintenance. A central feature of the ISR is the preferential translation of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) upon eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation (eIF2-P) by the AAI sensor, General Control Nonderepressible 2 (GCN2). GCN2 alters protein synthesis in cooperation with another nutrient-responsive target, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Loss of Gcn2 unleashes mTORC1 activity during AAI, creating a mismatch between metabolic state and need and resulting in proteotoxic stress. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to define the mechanism by which GCN2 suppresses mTORC1 signaling in response to AAI. We will delineate how these signaling networks influence diurnal rhythms in liver proteostasis and metabolism and contribute to the development of liver steatosis. Aim 2 is focused on how combinatorial transcriptional regulation influences physiological outcomes to AAI. To address this, we will first ascertain eIF2-P independent control of ATF4 translation. We will then study two transcription factors that, like ATF4, are preferentially translated in response to eIF2-P. First is CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Homologous Protein (CHOP) a pro-apoptotic transcription factor and ATF4 binding partner. Second is ATF5, an ATF4 paralog that is uniquely abundant in liver. We will use floxed mouse models to induce liver-specific or whole body deletion of these transcription factors alone or in combination with each other and monitor proteostasis alongside measurements of liver health and metabolism during AAI. Successful completion of the above aims will significantly change how activation of the ISR to AAI is understood and applied biomedically. This is significant because limitations in the canonical pathways currently prevent development of therapeutics properly targeting the proteostasis network and/or the timing of intervention, either to promote resilience or treat disease."

Tau protein, encoded by the MAPT gene, is a neuronally enriched protein with an established role as a
microtubule-binding protein. Abnormal accumulation of tau protein is a neuropathological hallmark of several
neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Dominant
mutations in the MAPT gene are present in inherited FTD, indicating that tau is causal in neurodegenerative
disease. However, whether these mutations lead to loss-of-function, gain-of-function or the acquisition of a novel
function is unknown. Furthermore, although there are no mutations in MAPT that cause inherited AD, how
alterations in tau function contribute to dysfunction in neural cells and pathological aggregation of tau protein are
still incompletely understood. These issues have not been resolved, largely because the functions of the tau
protein have not been conclusively determined. While highly expressed in neurons, tau is expressed in other
CNS cell types and has been linked to cellular localizations ranging from the nucleolus to the plasma membrane.
Furthermore tau-interacting proteins display a range of cellular functions including gene regulation, membrane
transport, RNA binding and metabolism and cytoskeletal elements. Together this suggests a role for tau protein
in central nervous system cells beyond microtubule stabilization. Many studies have examined the effects of
pathological tau, but only a limited number of studies have investigated the cellular functions of wild type,
endogenous tau. Examining cellular phenotypes in the absence of tau is one approach to understand its normal
function. To date, most studies have studied tau deficiency using rodent models or transformed human cell lines
and these studies show various and sometimes conflicting results. In this study, we will use our expertise in
human induced pluripotent stem cell technology to study loss of tau function in human neural cultures and cortical
organoids. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 to disrupt the human tau reading frame, generating tau-KO cell lines. We
will then pursue both unbiased transcriptomic profiling and hypothesis-based experiments examining molecular
and physiological consequences in neurons and astrocytes deficient in tau expression. We have generated pilot
data indicating a strong up-regulation of pathways involved in neuroimmune function in tau-KO cortical cultures
compared to isogenic WT controls and we have validated our findings with shRNAs targeting MAPT. Our
proposed experiments will use hiPSC-derived neurons and astrocytes to test cell autonomous and non-cell
autonomous responses to tau deficiency. These tau deficiency phenotypes include altered granulostasis and the
accumulation of double-stranded RNA, as suggested by our preliminary studies. We will also assess
electrophysiological function of tau deficient neurons cultured with wild-type astrocytes and wild-type neurons
cultured with tau deficient astrocytes. To our knowledge, there are no reports of tau-KO in hiPSC-derived
neural cell types, therefore the data generated by this study has the potential to significantly contribute
to understanding the role of tau in the central nervous system."
10831074,"ABSTRACT
Autoimmune diseases affect up to 8% of the US population and their prevalence is rising, setting the stage for
an impending public health crisis that we do not yet understand and are not prepared to face. Many
autoimmune diseases disproportionately affect women and those with skin of color, potentially worsening
existing health disparities within our population. We must define the mechanisms that drive this growing
risk for autoimmunity so that we can better manage, or even prevent, a scourge of severe morbidity
and mortality. Skin diseases are among the most prevalent autoimmune diseases and are simple to study
due to the ability to diagnose and track the progression of disease through direct observation and sampling
using minimally invasive tools. Thus, skin diseases provide unique insight into mechanisms of autoimmunity
that are difficult to determine when studying other organs and tissues.
We will leverage a multidisciplinary team of investigators, cutting edge tools designed for at-home, longitudinal
tissue sampling, and an innovative strategy to discover how autoimmunity begins, relapses, and spreads in a
large population of at-risk individuals. We and others have determined that unaffected, non-lesional skin from
patients with autoimmunity exists in a disease-specific “preclinical” state, but whether this predisposes the
patient to develop disease is an open question. We hypothesize that a molecular immune signature drives
a preclinical state within the skin that predisposes to disease initiation and advancement of
autoimmunity to other organs. To test this, we will use two ideally suited models of autoimmunity. To predict
development of autoimmunity de novo as well as disease relapse, we will take advantage of the unique
properties of vitiligo: a strong genetic component, early age of onset (majority <30 years old), strong
association with other autoimmune diseases, high prevalence (>1%), and rapid relapse after stopping therapy.
We will longitudinally monitor 200 individuals with vitiligo for disease relapse and 800 of their relatives who are
“at-risk” for developing new onset disease. To predict the “progression” of autoimmunity to other organs we will
monitor a cohort of patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE): up to 20% of patients who initially
exhibit skin-limited lupus eventually develop systemic disease, with a median time to progression of two years.
We will monitor 50 subjects with CLE to detect disease progression to internal organs.
We will use these innovative tools on a large scale through “population multiomics” to define immune
drivers of autoimmunity in patients and their family members over time. To test our hypothesis, we will
use computational integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data points to define a “preclinical
signature” of autoimmunity and use it to predict disease initiation and systemic progression. This
approach will provide insight into autoimmunity that will help physicians better manage, or even prevent,
devastating consequences of these diseases in the future."
10917080,"In the last 30 years, there has been no significant improvement in rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE).
These blood clots develop in the limbs and can travel to the lungs and form pulmonary emboli, which are the
most common cause of preventable deaths in the hospital. Currently available tools for predicting and preventing
hospital-acquired VTE (HA-VTE) were developed without sufficient input from frontline clinicians, add to clinician
workload, are too cumbersome to implement in daily clinical practice, exhibit poor-to-fair prediction accuracy,
and do not consider the risk of bleeding complications. Importantly, use of these tools has not been shown to
improve patient outcomes. A significant gap therefore exists between the current system of variable practice
patterns in VTE risk assessment and the goal of driving down rates of HA-VTE and reducing preventable deaths.
 Our objective is to refine, implement, and test a real-time prognostic model for HA-VTE among hospitalized
adults to facilitate appropriate and timely initiation of thromboprophylaxis by busy clinicians. Our multidisciplinary
team has developed a model that predicts the probability of HA-VTE among all adult inpatients based on clinical
factors and medical history. The model updates as the clinical scenario evolves, discriminates well between
high- and low-risk patients, and exhibits superior prediction performance compared with extant risk-stratification
tools. It is unknown whether use of a prognostic model for HA-VTE in clinical practice improves patient outcomes.
 To achieve this important objective, we will: conduct observations and interviews with clinicians to elucidate
their challenges with the current risk-assessment workflow and preferences for timing, content, and visualization
of a prognostic model (Aim 1); create user-friendly clinical decision support (CDS) tools—based on an accurate
and validated prognostic model for HA-VTE—that can be seamlessly integrated into existing clinical workflows,
simultaneously consider the risk of bleeding complications, and maximize use of electronic health record data in
real time (Aim 2); and conduct a pragmatic randomized trial and implementation evaluation of the prognostic
model plus CDS for prophylaxis compared with usual care for the prevention of HA-VTE. In an adaptive platform
trial, we will evaluate on a prospective basis the effectiveness of model-guided CDS to reduce HA-VTE, both
overall and among key patient subgroups, and study through randomization the implementation strategies that
work best for clinicians and improve patient outcomes (Aim 3). We will broadly disseminate the generalizable
knowledge and implementation tools that are urgently needed to prevent HA-VTE and avoid deaths in the
hospital, including an implementation manual, CDS knowledge artifacts, and open-source statistical software.
Relevance: Our proposal closely aligns with NHLBI objectives, namely: developing and optimizing a real-time
prognostic model to prevent HA-VTE, a HLBS disease; creating sustainable, adaptive implementation strategies
to reduce rates of HA-VTE; and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science through integration of multiple
types of data, innovative statistical methods, and informatics methodology to facilitate broad dissemination."
10899509,"The overarching goal of my research is to uncover the fundamental principles that drive bacterial success,
enabling them to colonize and proliferate in every corner of this planet. To accomplish this goal, I have
developed a unified bacterial-centric research vision cutting across classically defined subfields. I meld my long
history of unraveling the intricacies of bacterial control mechanisms with an ability to develop and implement
novel global technologies to open up understudied areas and computational approaches to extend findings
beyond model organisms. The current grant explores three important and related areas.
 First, fueled by two novel CRISPRi strategies that we developed, we continue our quest to identify
cellular construction principles by exploring three understudied sets of genes: cell envelope genes, essential
genes, and genes that accelerate growth transitions. We tackle the redundancy of function that has prevented
genetic analysis of the envelope with double CRISPRi, a technology that allows simultaneous knockdown of
two genes via adjacently encoded sgRNAs. We unravel the tradeoffs underlying the expression of essential
genes with mismatched CRISPRi, which uses single mismatches in the base pairing region of sgRNAs to
predictably titrate their efficacy. By measuring the fitness impact of graded knockdown, we determine the
expression-fitness relationships of essential genes and how they are affected by environmental and genetic
changes. Finally, we identify essential and non-essential genes that accelerate growth transitions.
 Second, we continue our studies of the general principles controlling translational output both by
exploring the extent to which ribosomes themselves influence the upstream process of transcription
(transcription/translation coupling) and the downstream process of mRNA degradation, and by determining
whether alternative ribosomal proteins produced under stress conditions result in new translational properties.
These studies are enabled by new technologies we developed for genome-wide measurement of ribosome
spacing and mRNA degradation.
 Third, we have begun an exciting new study of gene regulatory networks throughout the bacterial
kingdom. This effort is fueled by our new statistically rigorous, phylogenetic foot-printing approach, which we
have validated to have a low false positive rate coupled with high recall and precision. We plan to leverage the
vast existing database of bacterial genomes to examine evolution of gene regulatory networks across bacteria.
 Our studies also address an overwhelming current challenge: to develop experimental and
computational approaches that enable researchers to comprehensively explore the regulatory wiring and
functional diversity of bacteria that thrive in a wide variety of rapidly changing environments. Such approaches
can synergize with and exploit metagenomic data to empower mechanistic interrogation of gene function in
understudied organisms."
10898038,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a term that describes the unique properties of central nervous system (CNS)
blood vessels which allow them to stringently regulate the extracellular environment of the surrounding neural
tissue. While it is known that different brain regions are made up of diverse cell types and execute distinct
functions, it is unknown if the BBB exhibits varied features in functionally distinct regions to regulate specific
neural circuits. Since little is known about heterogeneity of the BBB, this project will address this gap in
knowledge and pursue the question of whether regional specializations of the blood-brain barrier may regulate
local circuit function and behavior. This will identify if the BBB could be targeted to modulate specific behaviors,
including reward and addiction.
 Single cell RNA sequencing revealed that there is significant inter-regional heterogeneity of the BBB via
differential gene expression in endothelial cells (ECs). While the canonical BBB genes that contribute to
restrictive barrier properties were expressed in ECs across all brain regions, many genes involved in transport,
signaling, and metabolism were found to be enriched in ECs of specific brain regions. For instance, Stra6, a
transport regulator of retinoids, is remarkably enriched in the nucleus accumbens shell (sNAc) and the ventral
cochlear nucleus (VCN) compared to other areas of the brain. The sNAc is particularly of interest because its
function in reward and reinforcement learning implicates the region in drug addiction. Due to the prevalence and
severity of addiction, it is urgently important to find new targets for treating this major public health issue by
asking if the BBB, via Stra6, plays a role in regulating addiction.
 The proposed study will address this critical need by determining (1) if the regional specificity of Stra6 at the
BBB is necessary for the development or adult function of the sNAc, (2) by what molecular mechanisms Stra6
regulates sNAc function, and (3) if Stra6 is required for learning addiction behavior. This proposal will test the
hypothesis that Stra6 concentrates retinoids within the sNAc, thereby dynamically regulating dopamine receptor
levels and thus the adult function of the sNAc in both spatial learning and addiction. The importance of Stra6 at
the BBB will be tested using conditional, EC-specific Stra6 knockout mice to excise Stra6 during development
or in adulthood. These aims will also test whether elevating dietary Vitamin A, the source of retinoids, can
increase retinoid levels in the absence of Stra6 and rescue sNAc function. The central goals of this proposal are
to gain deeper understanding of the BBB’s contribution to brain function, specify mechanisms of addiction, and
assess what factors might increase individual susceptibility to drug addiction."
10879031,"Project Summary/Abstract: It is known that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) have reduced visual acuity
which may result from high levels of refractive error (sphere and cylinder) and elevated levels of higher-order
aberrations that are present from childhood. Targeting optical aberrations through spectacle correction with
refractions determined objectively from measures of wavefront aberrations is part of our long-term goal to
provide new treatment strategies to improve vision in this group. The central hypothesis is that measures of
visual and retinal image quality (metrics) can be used to identify sphere and cylinder corrections that optimize
vision, resulting in multi-line acuity gains over traditional corrections. Our previous evaluation of these
corrections in adults with DS found improvement in acuity, but not the multi-line levels predicted. We propose
that this mismatch in acuity gains is attributed to decades of exposure to poorly corrected optical deficits that
has resulted in a reduction in visual acuity potential (i.e. refractive amblyopia). Further, the method is inherently
monocular, and does not prescribe refractions reflective of the two-eyed visual experience of the patient, as
would occur in a clinical exam. The short-term goal of this work is to address these proposed barriers to multi-
line acuity improvements with metric-optimized refractions through a randomized treatment trial conducted in
children with DS who are within the optimal age for treatment of amblyopia. This trial will compare acuity
outcomes for three refractive methods: 1) metric-optimized refractions, 2) clinical refractions, and 3) a hybrid
method that allows for clinical refinement of the metric-optimized refraction. In addition, we seek to improve the
objective refraction process by removing dilation prior to the wavefront imaging necessary to compute the
metric values, as well as determining the rate of change in refraction during extended follow-up to guide patient
recall times (i.e. follow-up intervals) for updated refraction. This work will be accomplished through three
specific aims: Aim 1) Compare refractions and resultant visual acuity obtained from wavefront measures pre-
and post-dilation. Aim 2) Compare visual acuity outcomes of metric-optimized, clinical, and clinically-refined
metric-optimized refractions in a treatment trial of children with DS. Aim 3) Determine rate of change in
refraction as a function of age and refractive error type annually over four years in children and adults with DS.
Metric-optimized refraction is innovative in that it compensates for the absence of subjective input in the
refraction process for the DS population and allows the clinician to consider corrections targeting overall image
quality. This proposed research is significant in that it proposes to use spectacles in an optimized manner to
remove visual barriers. Treatment of refractive amblyopia with multi-line acuity gains would lead to lifelong
benefits, including access to traditional print size, facilitate educational efforts, and facilitate activities of daily
living, all of which may promote greater independence. This work is similarly applicable to other patient
populations who cannot fully participate in subjective refractions (young children, cognitively impaired, etc.)."
10842362,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The failure of surgery to provide a long-disease free survival interval to patients with resected pancreatic
cancer is related to the inability to recognize occult tumor foci at metastatic or locoregional sites. For
surgery to be effective, there is a critical need for real-time detection of small, sub-clinical metastases (if
present) and for visualization of the tumor’s invisible infiltration along the boundaries of the planned
resection. The overall objective of this application is to clinically validate the use of a fluorescently labeled
anti-EGFR antibody, panitumumab-IRDye800CW (pan800), for the intraoperative detection of low-volume
(1-3 mm3) pancreatic cancer tumor foci in vivo. The central hypothesis is that Near InfraRed (NIR)
intraoperative imaging with pan800 will enable ultrasensitive detection of tumor deposits that would
otherwise escape detection using current imaging technology and surgical inspection/palpation. In the
proposed study, patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma eligible for surgery will undergo infusion of
pan800 2-5 days prior to surgery and NIR cameras will be used intraoperatively to detect 1-3 mm³ tumor
foci. The following two specific aims will be pursued: 1) Determine the diagnostic accuracy of pan800
intraoperative fluorescent imaging to detect radiographically occult (i.e., unseen by the radiologist)
pancreatic adenocarcinoma metastases; and 2) Determine the efficacy of pan800 fluorescent imaging to
identify visibly occult (i.e., unseen by the surgeon) residual tumor foci at the post-surgical resection bed in
vivo or at the margin of the resected specimen ex vivo. Under the first aim, the sensitivity and specificity of
this intraoperative imaging modality to identify small, sub-radiologic peritoneal metastases will be
documented. For the second aim, the incremental yield of this modality over conventional bright-field
inspection in identifying otherwise invisible tumor foci at the resection bed or specimen margin will be
demonstrated. The repurposing of readily available therapeutic EGFR antibodies to surgical imaging agents
is not only safe and cost effective, but also highly innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, as it can challenge
the status quo related to intraoperative pancreatic cancer detection, which has not fundamentally changed
over several decades. The proposed research is significant because it will build upon the previously
demonstrated efficacy of pan800 to detect pancreatic cancer in vivo, providing new opportunities for its
continued development as a tool to enhance intraoperative staging, support decision making, increase the
likelihood of complete tumor resection, and eventually improve clinical outcomes for patients with this highly
lethal malignancy."

The Administrative Core (AC) will coordinate the activities of the Service Cores (Aim 1), and
will engage the local vision research community with respect to providing information regarding
core activities and available resources (Aim 2). In the coordination role, the Steering
Committee will be an essential component in ensuring that resources are fairly allocated, and
that the offered services are delivered with outstanding quality. The AC will also communicate
with vision researchers at The University of Iowa to keep them informed concerning Service
Core utilization, gather feedback on Core activities, and ensure that the selection of offered
services remain relevant and state-of-the-art over time. In addition, the Administrative Core will
facilitate training within The University of Iowa Vision Research community (Aim 3). This will be
achieved by the organization and implementation of an annual training meeting related to
vision research and key methodologies needed for state-of-the-art vision research. The
symposia will be targeted at students, post-doctoral trainees and new junior faculty.
Importantly, in these pandemic times the AC will aid in keeping vision research laboratories
and the Service Cores productive during the pandemic (Aim 4). To achieve this, the
Administrative Core will oversee, provide, and coordinate COVID-19 molecular testing to all
vision research laboratory personnel at The University of Iowa including the staff of the Service
Cores enabling laboratories to remain open, safe, functional and efficient. The ongoing delivery
of the Administrative Core aims will allow vision scientists to enhance their individual and
collective research programs substantially, and thereby drive discoveries, innovation, and
treatments."
10846603,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is a proposal for a five-year career development program to study hormonally-determined metabolic
programs as therapeutic targets for prostate cancer. The candidate is currently an Instructor of Oncology at
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous research and
clinical experience and integrates two distinct areas of expertise of her mentors, Dr. Samuel Denmeade and Dr.
Erika Pearce, to understand metabolic vulnerabilities induced by high dose androgen in prostate cancer. In spite
of recent advances in prostate cancer therapy development, this disease continues to kill more than 350,000
men per year worldwide. Standard-of-care therapies inhibit androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which often leads
to adaptive upregulation of AR to drive resistance. We have shown that this upregulation of AR constitutes a
vulnerability to high dose androgen and are developing a novel therapy called Bipolar Androgen Therapy (BAT)
in which high dose androgen is provided intermittently to result in cycling of serum androgens to minimize
adaptations to high or low levels of androgens. To date, our clinical trials indicate that BAT is safe, improves
quality of life, and can induce responses in a subset of patients for whom there are very limited therapeutic
options. We are now seeking to expand the population of patients who benefit from BAT by identifying metabolic
synthetic lethal vulnerabilities induced by exposure to high levels of androgens in the initial phase of BAT. This
proposal focuses on identifying metabolic vulnerabilities because (1) a fundamental effect of androgens across
numerous tissues in the body, including benign and malignant prostate, is alteration of cellular metabolism and
(2) metabolic plasticity is an emerging common pathway of resistance to cancer therapies. Our preliminary data
using global metabolomics and a metabolism-focused CRISPR-based genetic screen indicate that high dose
androgen dramatically reprograms prostate cancer metabolism resulting in vulnerabilities including de novo
polyamine synthesis and nucleotide synthesis. Specific aims proposed will interrogate synthetic lethality of high
dose androgen in combination with inhibition of polyamine synthesis (Aim 1) and with inhibition of nucleotide
synthesis (Aim 2). Aim 3 will assess efficacy of combination therapies across a highly characterized panel of
patient-derived xenograft models of castration-resistant prostate cancer that approximate the diversity of patients
with this disease. The outlined career development and research plan will provide the candidate with unique
cross-disciplinary skills that will enable her transition to independence as a physician scientist and identify
promising combination therapies for treatment of patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer."
10825590,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor disease with a median overall survival of approximately 15
months. GBM patients die because of the constant ability of GBM to acquire resistance mechanisms against
anti-cancer therapies, therefore leading to an inevitable tumor recurrence.
 A. Radiation therapy (RT) is a pivotal modality for improving overall survival of GBM. However, GBM invar-
iably recurs, which suggests that RT is eliciting or exacerbating mechanisms of resistance in GBM. Identifying
and overcoming the contributing factors involved in GBM resistance is a major challenge. Immunosup-
pression exerted by cells expressing fibroblast activating protein-alpha (FAP) can account for the lack of immu-
nogenicity of irradiated GBM. FAP is a type II transmembrane serine protease that is heavily expressed in the
stroma of multiple solid tumors and has thus become a marker to identify cancer-cell associated fibroblasts
(CAFs). While our knowledge about CAFs or CAF-like cells in GBM is limited. Few studies reported the presence
of glioblastoma-associated stromal cells (GASCs) that share phenotypic and functional properties of CAFs de-
scribed in the stroma of carcinomas, but none investigated the role of this cell type in respect to immunosup-
pression of irradiated GBM. Our preliminary analyses suggest that FAP+ cells represent a major immune sup-
pressive subset in irradiated GBM. Specifically, we demonstrate that (1) FAP+ cells with fibroblastic morphology
surround GBM tumor, (2) FAP is mostly expressed by tumor infiltrating myeloid cells in vivo, (3) in vitro irradiation
of GBM and microglia cells enhances FAP together with PD-L1 and PD-L2 expressions and (4) targeting FAP
increases the recruitment of CD8+ T cells and CD11c+ into GBM in vivo. This work shed light on FAP+ cells as
a master regulator of anti- immunity and identifies FAP targeting as a new strategy to immune reactivity of irra-
diated GBM. In this application, we propose to test the novel and innovative hypothesis that FAP+ cells
represent a major immune suppressive subset that provide the means to suppress anti-tumor immunity in
GBM. Successful completion of this work will (1) uncover the role of FAP+ cells in immunosuppression
of irradiated GBM and (2) provide evidence for a novel therapeutic intervention that will break through
immune resistance of irradiated GBM by targeting FAP."

 Diffusion MRI analysis is the primary tool for studying brain white matter microstructure. Adolescent brain
development involves significant microstructural changes due to brain reorganization and neural pruning. The
trajectory of these changes can be altered by the onset of mental disorders, and longitudinal analysis of
diffusion imaging is needed to capture these alterations. Our proposal aims to make available an open source
software platform for exploratory analysis of longitudinal diffusion MRI datasets, and to apply it to study the
early onset of bipolar disorder in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) data.
 Diffusion tensor imaging is not sufficient to distinguish the different types of changes that occur during
adolescent brain development, so our software tool will support more advanced diffusion models such as
Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging. This takes advantage of the high angular resolution of
ABCD diffusion images. The exploratory tools we develop will employ the widely used Tract-Based Spatial
Statistics (TBSS) technique, which is a dimensionality reduction that is well suited for exploratory analysis.
Going beyond standard TBSS, we will adapt the technique to work with improved registration techniques, to
work with more advanced diffusion models, and to provide developmental trajectories based on longitudinal
imaging data.
 The TBSS methodology requires high quality image alignment. In order to achieve this, we will develop a
deep learning model for pairwise registration of diffusion datasets, speeding up an important step in diffusion
MRI analysis. By generating fiber orientation distributions from the ABCD diffusion imaging, our registration
model will align fiber orientations in addition to anatomical structures.
 These tools will be made available in an open source software platform. While there are many tools for
exploring diffusion MRI data, this one will be unique in its support for longitudinal datasets with high angular
resolution imaging."

In the United States, 18% of individuals aged 18 and over have a physical disability (defined as a mobility
impairment).1 Individuals with physical disabilities are less likely to meet physical activity guidelines than
individuals without disabilities, which may be connected to higher likelihood of poor physical and mental health
outcomes in the disability community.3 This gap in participation is in large part due to critical barriers to
participation.2,4,5 While individuals with physical disabilities have a basic right to full participation in society,6 there
are substantial medical, psychological, social, and environmental barriers that make full participation in physical
activity difficult.7 Research in this area has, however, largely overlooked a rapidly growing type of physical activity
participation: active eSports.2,4,5,8 The promise of active eSports leagues for physical activity promotion among
individuals with physical disabilities lies in the fact that, as a virtual sport, it could be easily scaled to reach diverse
communities that may not have resources for in-person parasport programming and promote physical activity
participation. However, according to preliminary research, individuals with physical disabilities who participate in
active eSports may be experiencing substantial inequities that would not be permitted in traditional sport
contexts.9 The objective of the proposed grant is to understand full participation6,10 for individuals with physical
disabilities in active eSports. More specifically, we seek to extend our previous research on quality parasport
participation to the realm of active eSports and answer the question: “What constitutes quality participation for
adults with physical disabilities in active eSports?” To answer this question, we will follow the blueprint laid out
in our previous development of the Quality Parasport Participation Framework2 and pursue three aims. In Aim
1, we will conduct a scoping review of active eSports research. We will examine existing literature on active
eSports among individuals with physical disabilities across the lifespan, with a focus on identifying barriers and
benefits to participation, as well as mechanisms linked to experiential aspects of participation. In Aim 2, we will
conduct a qualitative investigation seeking to understand experiences and perceptions of active eSports for
adults with physical disabilities. Finally, in Aim 3, we will develop a testable conceptual model of participation in
active eSports for adults with physical disabilities through a multi-step stakeholder-centered process. eSports is
the world’s fastest growing sport, with matches hosted by prominent gatekeepers to the traditional sports world,
including the International Olympic Committee.8,11,12 The findings from the proposed research will provide an
evidence base for future interventions, as well as a method for assessing full participation, equity, and inclusion
of people with physical disabilities in this new, rapidly growing sport."

10844617,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Financial strain and substance use are widespread in the United States (US), as many adults struggle to meet
basic financial needs. Financial strain is distinct from its sources (e.g., job or income loss), as perception of strain
may be necessary to produce a stress-response that prompts substance use as a coping mechanism. Studies
examining the relationship between financial strain and substance use have focused on the association between
financial strain and alcohol use, or acute financial strain due to sudden changes in job or income. However, there
is a need to examine whether the relationship between financial strain and substance use varies by substance,
and the duration of financial strain (i.e., acute financial strain due to sudden job or income loss, chronic financial
strain due to persistent deprivation, or intermittent financial strain due to repeated periods of economic
insecurity). Anti-poverty programs such as the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) may provide an
opportunity to reduce financial strain and subsequent substance use by providing financial support to low-income
populations. The current R36 proposal seeks to provide novel insights about the associations between acute,
chronic, or intermittent financial strain and cannabis, CNS depressant, alcohol, and polysubstance use, and
whether federal EITC eligibility alters these relationships. To achieve these goals, we propose three aims that
will leverage individual- and state-level data from 5 waves (2013-2019) of the Population Assessment of Tobacco
and Health study, a longitudinal cohort of >30,000 US adults. Aim 1 will examine the association between
financial strain and cannabis, CNS depressant, alcohol, or polysubstance use at subsequent time points using
parametric g-computation, accounting for time-varying confounding, and examining effect modification by sex.
Aim 2 will create exposure trajectories of financial strain (i.e., none, acute, chronic, and intermittent) across four
waves of data collection, and examine the risk of cannabis, CNS depressant, alcohol, or polysubstance use at
Wave 5 using a mixed model to adjust for substance use trajectories and recency of financial strain. Aim 3 will
examine whether federal EITC eligibility is associated with short-term changes in financial strain, cannabis, CNS
depressant, alcohol or polysubstance use, and whether financial strain mediates the relationship between federal
EITC eligibility and substance use, examining effect modification by sex and state EITC. This project will advance
NIDA’s research priority to support dissertation research examining social factors that influence drug use
outcomes, and determine how policies affect drug use trends. Findings from this R36 study will help identify
individuals at risk for substance use, inform policies seeking to alleviate financial strain, and will inform a future
K award application. The proposed project and mentorship team will provide the principal investigator with the
opportunity to develop expertise at the intersection of health economics, substance use epidemiology, and policy
research, in pursuit of her long-term goal of becoming an independent researcher at an academic institution."

Mitral valvular regurgitation (MVR) is one of the most common valvular diseases affecting over 5% of the U.S.

(echo) is the mainstay imaging modality for MVR where quantitation of MVR flow plays an instrumental role in
determining disease severity. However, inherent weaknesses of echo (2D acquisition, 1-directional velocity
measurements) limit quantification precision due to complex MVR hemodynamics characterized as a high-
velocity (4-6 m/s), heterogeneous (eccentric/multiple/non-holosystolic jets) flow jets with dynamically changing
mitral orifice morphology. Cardiac MRI (CMR) can be used to indirectly quantify MVR flow volume based on
differences in stroke volumes measured at different sites, however, errors in each measurement are amplified
due to subtraction and is inapplicable in patients with shunt flows and/or multiple valvular lesions. Further,
discordance between CMR and echo has consistently been reported suggesting a need for an accurate and
reliable quantitative technique.
4D flow MRI provides unique access to 4D (3D+time) intra-cardiac blood flow enabling “direct” quantification of
MVR jet flSow dynamics free from limitations in conventional echo- and CMR-based methods. However, clinical
translation of this approach remains challenging for two reasons. One is that a high velocity encoding sensitivity
(venc) of 4-6 m/s is required for conventional single-venc 4D flow MRI to capture high peak MVR flow jet velocity.
This limits velocity dynamic range of 4D flow MRI and thus, resulting in poor flow visualization and increased
flow quantification uncertainty. The other is that post-processing requires manual and cumbersome detection of
MVR flow jet in a 3D whole heart over a cardiac cycle, plane placement and jet contouring over many timeframes
limiting measurement reproducibility. This proposal seeks to address these limitations by developing a fast dual-
venc 4D flow MRI technique optimized for MVR flow velocity acquisition and second, a deep learning technique
for detection and segmentation of 4D MVR flow jet to fully automate MVR flow quantification process. The
specific objectives are: (1) to optimize CS dual-venc 4D flow MRI using in-vitro pulsatile MVR flow jet models,
(2) to validate the dual-venc 4D flow MRI in 60 MVR patients against echo and CMR acquired on the same-day
and (3) to develop a deep learning network to fully automate MVR flow quantification pipeline.
This project will generate a reproducible and accurate quantitative approach for clinical evaluation of MVR. Our
framework enjoys multiple innovations in imaging, deep learning, and clinical application. Lessons learned from
this should be applicable to quantification of other valvular regurgitant lesions, thus greatly expanding the impact
of this work."
10893455,"Project Summary/Abstract
The goal of this project is to investigate whether the loss of key supporting cell fate genes will enhance the
reprogramming and regeneration of cochlear cells into hair cells as a strategy for hearing restoration. We have
found that supporting cells of the mature cochlea can be reprogrammed into hair cell-like cells following
combined damage AND reprogramming with Atoh1+Gfi1+Pou4f3. We have also found that non-sensory cells
of the inner and outer sulcus can be reprogrammed with Atoh1+Gfi1+Pou4f3 and provide a second potential
population of cells for hearing restoration. Here, we are targeting two Sox-family genes that regulate hair cell
fate but are expressed in supporting cells and other non-sensory cells in the mature cochlea.
Sox-family members Sox2 and Sox10 are both linked to hair cell fate decisions as they each produce ectopic
hair cells when one allele is lost. Supporting cells nearest to the inner hair cells appear to be particularly
susceptible to the combined loss of both Sox2 AND Sox10 in the production of ectopic inner hair cells.
Moreover, preliminary data suggests that reprogrammed hair cell-like cells do not turn off Sox2 or Sox10
possibly limiting their complete fate conversion. Remarkably, the loss of one allele of Sox2 increases the
number of regenerated hair cells suggesting that it is preventing hair cell fate in these cells.
Here, we hypothesize that supporting cell network genes, Sox2 and Sox10, are restricting the cell’s ability to
turn into a hair cell following reprograming. To test this hypothesis, we will use genetically modified mouse
models to reprogram and regenerate cochlear cells into hair cell-like cells. In addition to reprogramming we
will: i) completely delete Sox2 from cochlear supporting cells in the organ of Corti, ii) delete one copy of Sox10
from non-sensory cells of the inner and outer sulcus, and iii) delete one copy of Sox2 PLUS one copy of Sox10
from supporting cells in the organ of Corti. Following each of these genetic manipulations, we will investigate
whether the number or the maturity of hair cell-like cells has improved. We anticipate that our studies will
reveal a unique role for supporting cell network genes as a target for hearing restoration therapies."

Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with activated and expanded T or CAR T cells may be used to treat infections or
tumors and ACT with T or CAR T regulatory cells are in clinical trials to control autoimmunity and allograft
rejection. Many but not all patients benefit. The success of ACT depends upon T cell homing to relevant tissue
sites. Normal circulating T effector memory or T regulatory cells can enter a tissue in response to their cognate
antigen being displayed on the surface of the local microvascular ECs in a process triggered by TCR and
modulated by costimulation. We hypothesize that antigen presentation by human endothelial cells (ECs)
will recruit adoptively transferred in vitro expanded T or CAR T effector and regulatory cells to specific
peripheral tissue sites in a process modulated by specific EC co-stimulators. In specific aim 1, we will
test this hypothesis in vitro in models we have developed using endothelial cell monolayers in flow chambers
to model in vivo conditions. We will expand our in vitro assys to include an examination of the effects that TCR-
induced transendothelial migration (TEM) has on the T cells at the single cell level. In the case of CAR T cells,
we will determine the most important costimulator receptor molecule motifs to be incorporated into the CAR for
optimal TEM. We will also determine if human ECs have the capacity to cross-present or be “cross-dressed” by
antigens allowing EC presentation of antigen to influence cancer immunotherapy. Finally, we will use a model
we developed for studying adoptively transferred human T cell responses to synthestic microvessels
assembled from human ECs, allowing genetic manipulation of the signals human ECs can provide. In aim 2
we will conduct similar experiments using T and CAR T regulatory cells. Successful completion of these aims
will provide important information for extending the range of patients who may benefit from ACT."
10812416,"Project Summary/Abstract: The uniform lethality of glioblastoma (GBM) with a survival of less than 2
years despite best available therapy is attributed to treatment resistance due to DNA repair mechanisms that
drive disease relapse and tumor heterogeneity. One prognostic factor identified as a reliable biomarker for GBM
sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy (RT) is the overexpression of O6-methylguanine-methyl-
transferase (MGMT) enzyme. Patients with active MGMT were found to receive little benefit from TMZ and RT
and represent a group of great unmet need with no treatment options that significantly improve survival. Recently,
several preclinical and clinical studies suggest that alcohol aversion drug, disulfiram (DSF), inhibited MGMT and
improved the efficacy of TMZ in GBM when combined with copper (Cu). However, phase II trial showed that
there was no survival benefit from oral Cu/DSF. Nevertheless, the major limitation of oral Cu/DSF has been
delivery of fragile DSF within the in vivo system.
 We have developed 2-hydroxypropyl beta cyclodextrin (HPßCD) encapsulating Cu complex of DSF metabolite,
diethyldithiocarbamic acid (DDC), Cu(DDC)2 delivery system that addresses major drawbacks of the Cu(DDC)2:
easy degradation in the blood and non-specific interactions with cells and serum proteins and lack of tissue
specific delivery. HPßCD providing stability of Cu(DDC)2 is identified. In vitro cell culture study revealed that
HPßCD-Cu(DDC)2 inhibited MGMT through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Inhibition of MGMT activity in cell
cultures vastly increased the alkylation-induced DNA double-strand breaks, cytotoxicity, and the levels of
apoptotic markers like -H2AX, JNK-P and cleavage of PARP-1. Preliminary intravenous delivery of HPßCD-
Cu(DDC)2 in combination with TMZ in an MGMT-positive patient derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model
demonstrated tumor size regression with prolonged survival. HPßCD-Cu(DDC)2 targets MGMT-145-cysteine
and its unique cytotoxic mechanism circumvents MGMT-mediated chemo- and radiation resistance. The present
work aimed at the development and application of HPßCD-Cu(DDC)2 for targeted delivery of drug to GBM.
Chlorotoxin (CTX), a peptide reported to bind selectively to glioma cells while showing no affinity for non-
neoplastic cells, will covalently be coupled to functionalized HPßCD encapsulating Cu(DDC)2. We have shown
that PDOXs without MGMT expression are sensitive to RT. Therefore, we hypothesize that the combination of
GBM targeting CTX-HPßCD-Cu(DDC)2 with TMZ and RT will overcome TMZ+RT resistance and show
synergistic cytotoxic effect in PDOXs which will be monitored by MRI studies. Our objectives of the proposed
research are A) To incorporate targeting ligand CTX with HPßCD-Cu(DDC)2 to obtain an active brain drug
delivery system, B) To determine the efficacy and safety of oral DSF/Cu versus intravenous CTX-HPßCD-

10904669,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Objective. Our objective is to build on our preliminary work that a Non-IsChemic Exercise (NICE) program
will be a better treatment for patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) to improve ambulation, health-related
quality of life (HRQoL), microvascular function, and systemic vascular biomarkers than a Standard painful
exercise program.
 Specific Aims. We propose to test our central hypothesis that the NICE intervention performed without
inducing leg ischemia and its’ damaging sequela will be a superior exercise paradigm to increase peak walking
time and HRQoL more than the Standard ischemic and painful exercise paradigm via greater improvement in
microvascular mechanisms. This clinically relevant hypothesis will be tested through the following aims:
 Aim 1 (Exercise Outcomes) To compare the changes in ambulation and HRQoL in PAD patients
randomized to either the NICE slow walking program or to the Standard program of ischemic and painful exercise.
 Aim 2a (Vascular Outcomes) To compare the changes in local microvascular function of the lower
extremities, inflammation and oxidative stress in patients following the NICE program, and following the Standard
ischemic and painful program.
 Aim 2b (Exploratory Aim) To explore whether the changes in local microvascular function and systemic
vascular biomarkers are associated with the changes in peak walking time following the NICE and Standard
programs, and whether the association is stronger following the NICE program.
 Methods. This is a 3-month, patient-oriented, translational, comparative effectiveness randomized
controlled trial. One-hundred patients will be randomized into either the NICE program (N=50) or the Standard
exercise program (N=50). All patients will perform supervised treadmill walking for 3 months. Patients randomized
to the NICE program will walk intermittently at a slow speed of approximately 1.4 mph for only 2-3 minute bouts
that do not elicit claudication pain. Patients randomized to the Standard program will walk intermittently at a
speed of approximately two mph to near maximal claudication pain.
 Clinical Significance. If successful, the NICE program which consists of slow-paced walking that does
not elicit leg ischemia or pain will be a novel and innovative exercise program, and will be the exercise paradigm
of choice to optimally improve peak walking time, HRQoL, local microvascular function, inflammation, and oxidative
stress in PAD patients. These improvements could impact the clinical course of PAD by leading to healthier and
more active lifestyles."
10767346,"ABSTRACT
Multiple diseases, including graft-versus-host disease, transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, and
lung fibrosis are known to be driven by pathological activation of T cells. While T cell activation is a key
part of many immune responses, this process can become pathological when T cells inaccurately
recognize a patient’s own tissues or in the context of tissue transplantation. While immunomodulatory
drugs including corticosteroids and cyclosporine are FDA-approved, these agents act on many immune
cell types, leading to broad immunosuppression and severe side effects. Past high-throughput
screening efforts identified and validated small molecule ‘Selective Inhibitors of T Cell Activation
(SITCAs)’ that function in vitro and in vivo without influencing inflammatory responses in other cell
types. While these molecules suggested the potential for novel T cell-selective immunomodulatory
agents, lack of understanding of their cellular targets prevented further drug discovery efforts.
Exportin-1 (XPO1) catalyzes nuclear-to-cytoplasmic transport of hundreds of proteins and also has
established roles in regulating the centromere and transcription. The highly toxic natural product
Leptomycin was used to establish that blocking XPO1-mediated nuclear export led to cancer cell death,
and later efforts led to FDA approval of selinexor, a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE), for
multiple myeloma patients who have failed at least four prior therapies. Our data establish that multiple
Selective Inhibitors of T Cell Activation also target XPO1, but with novel pharmacology: these ‘partial
antagonists’ inhibit XPO1’s novel role in the T cell activation process but have minimal effects on
nuclear export and are substantially less cytotoxic. These data suggest that XPO1 represents a
promising new target for blocking pathological T cell activation, and that the novel partial antagonist
profile is desirable to avoid on-target cytotoxicity associated with existing XPO1 modulators.
This proposal seeks to understand and optimize XPO1 partial antagonists for application in immune-
mediated diseases. First, we seek to use structural and functional assays to understand how different
small molecules that bind the same site of XPO1 show such divergent effects on cellular phenotypes
including nuclear export and cell viability. In Aim 2, we will establish the cellular mechanisms by which
XPO1 modulators block T cell activation, with the hypothesis that dissociation from chromatin of XPO1,
NFAT transcription factors, and other chromatin factors plays a central role. Finally, we will use
medicinal chemistry to optimize the partial antagonist profile and evaluate leading partial antagonists
in preclinical models of T cell function, including using human primary T cells and in a mouse model of
lung fibrosis in which T cells are known to play a role. Together these studies will extend XPO1 as a
therapeutic beyond late-stage cancer patients by optimizing novel partial antagonists of XPO1."
10840847,"Robust navigation, which is critical for an animal’s survival, requires the processing of complex
sensory information spanning different modalities and time scales. Unlike human-engineered
systems, where sensors are passive and modularized and decisions are typically made
centrally, biological sensors constantly interact and influence each other, and behavioral
decisions are made on different time scales with diverse goals. Further, such decisions are
based on actively collected sensory information. Our team’s long-term goal is to elucidate the
entire neural circuit dynamics from inter-sensory interaction and multisensory integration in the
central brain to the generation of motor commands across different time scales. We use
Drosophila melanogaster to take advantage of the genetic tools, rich behaviors, and the
available tools to reconstruct the neural circuits with full brain electron microscopy data. We will
investigate how visual information, mechanical information (wind), and gyroscopic information
(sensing body rotation) are integrated and used to generate motor commands. We aim to test
the following hypotheses: (1) Sensory information from one modality affects the processing of
different sensory modalities (e.g., gyroscopic sensation may drive neck muscles to effectively
change the visual input). (2) Information from multiple sensors is integrated in the central brain
using attractor dynamics that unify winner-takes-all and Kalman filter mechanisms. (3) The
central brain not only integrates sensory stimuli, but actively drives sensory muscles to
maximize task-relevant information, increasing robustness of sensory processing. To test these
hypotheses, we combine our team’s diverse and complementary expertise, including two-
photon calcium imaging, one photon muscle imaging, whole-cell patch clamping, precise
sensory perturbation, high speed behavioral analysis, aerodynamics, single-cell resolution
optogenetic perturbation, computational modeling, network theory, and control theory. We will
develop a new control theoretical framework supported by anatomical, behavioral, and
physiological experiments. We will test predictions of models using behavioral and optogenetic
perturbation methods to further refine the theory. The successful completion of this project will
put our team in an ideal position to further investigate multiple sensorimotor transformation
pathways with different time scales, spanning reflexive response (fast), obstacle avoidance
(medium), and voluntary navigational decisions (slow). Overall, our team aims to reveal the
computational principles of neural network dynamics underlying robust navigation."
10866567,"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a predictor of substance use among early adolescents
Risk behaviors that cause negative health outcomes, such as substance use or sexual risk behaviors, typically
begin in adolescence. Identifying those most at risk in early adolescence is critical for prevention interventions.
Emotion regulation plays an important role in reducing adolescent risk but detecting those who are vulnerable
because of deficits in emotion regulation during early adolescence is challenging due to poor adolescent
insight into these still-developing emotional processes. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an index of heart
rate variability that is influenced by the parasympathetic nervous system, is an established marker of emotion
regulation processes. RSA does not rely on self-report and may be useful for early identification of risk. Our
team has developed a novel virtual reality party task with which to assess emotion regulation patterns in
adolescents. Pilot data in our laboratory using this task suggest that adolescents with a history of substance
use exhibit slower return to baseline RSA (measured at rest) after exposure to a challenging situation (referred
to as recovery RSA) compared to non-using peers. This may suggest that recovery RSA is a relevant index of
emotion regulation related to risk behaviors, as emotional triggers often occur in rapid succession in real-world
risk situations. The proposed study will prospectively examine RSA's utility in predicting adolescent risk
behaviors (substance use and sexual risk) among a sample of 280 early adolescents (ages 12.0-12.5 years)
for a period of 24 months. We will also evaluate whether emotion regulation in the context of a substance use
and sexual risk-taking situation (the virtual reality party) is more useful in predicting risk behavior than a
computer risk-taking task (the Balloon Analogue Risk Task). We also will examine strategies for defining
recovery RSA, given inconsistencies in the current literature. The current proposal advances the field by
combining virtual reality and RSA collection to assess emotion regulation with the aim of identifying markers of
those most vulnerable to engaging in risk behaviors at an early age, thus innovating the science of prevention."
10914631,"A novel passive sampler to assess personal exposures to airborne biological agents
This grant application responds to PAR-18-798: NIOSH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Program (R21). We
propose developing and testing a qualitatively new personal sampling device to monitor personal exposures to
bioaerosols without needing a pump or power source while being lightweight, unobtrusive, and cheap. These
advances are enabled by using novel materials and innovative sampler design. In addition, this novel personal
sampling concept is strongly supported by preliminary data. We hypothesize that Personal Rutgers Electrostatic
Passive Sampler (P-REPS) will have a sampling performance comparable to existing active personal samplers
while offering light weight, small footprint, low cost, absence of pumps or power supplies, and sampling
timeframes as long as days and even weeks. The sampler will help us better understand personal exposures to
airborne biological agents and the transmission of those agents in occupational environments.
 P-REPS will use an electrostatic field created by specially configured poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) film, a
permanently polarized ferroelectric polymer, to capture bioaerosol particles. The PVDF film will be wound in a
spiral configuration so that the film surfaces with opposing polarization face one another and create a strong
electrostatic field. The electrostatic field between the film layers and its fringing effect will attract bioaerosol and
deposit them onto the film for post-sampling elution and analysis. The film will be secured in a 3D-printed frame,
protective housing, and a slotted umbrella-shaped cap. Once the sampler is manufactured, it will be tested in
chamber studies against an active personal sampler using several airborne microorganisms. The organisms
captured by both samplers will be examined using microscopy, culturing, and ATP analysis and their quantity
will be compared. The data will be used to calculate the Equivalent Sampling Rate (ESR) of P-REPS – a flow
rate at which a filter sampler would capture the same number of microorganisms. Next, P-REPS will be tested
against a reference sampler in several field environments with different microorganism concentrations. Here,
both samplers will be placed on rotating manikins and also worn by study personnel. Our goal is to achieve ESR
similar to or better than the flow rate of an active personal filter-based sampler, such as the IOM sampler.
 The proposal responds to NIOSH Strategic Plan’s “Immune, Infectious, and Dermal Disease Prevention”
cross-sector and sectors of National Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing; Healthcare; Services; Transportation,
Warehousing, and Utilities. This proposal responds to the NIOSH r2P initiative by developing an innovative
personal sampler to determine personal exposures to bioaerosols, especially over long time frames, thus leading
to worker health protection. The output of the study will be a prototype P-REPS for determining personal
exposures to respiratory agents in occupational environments. We expect that intermediate outcomes will include
a patent, citations in the literature, and, finally, the adaptation of the sampler in work environments. The end
outcome is expected to be a better understanding of personal exposure to bioaerosols in workplaces."
10875642,"Life Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility Shared Resource (LSMSF-SR): 
 Project Summary 
 Mass spectrometry plays key roles across a wide range of atomic and molecular analyses relevant to the life 
sciences in general and cancer research specifically. Mass spectrometry, as a category within measurement 
science, is comprised of a variety of technologies and methodologies that provide qualitative and quantitative 
information based on the measurement of atomic and molecular mass. Measurements made by Purdue Center 
for Cancer Research (PCCR) members range from analytes as diverse as atomic species, to large multi-unit 
bio-complexes, and involve a variety of compound classes that include, inter alia, small molecule drugs, lipids, 
nucleic acids, and proteins. 
 Mass spectrometry has experienced a dramatic expansion in its range of applications over the past several 
decades due to major technological developments that have led to new and improved approaches to making 
ions, measuring ions, and probing ions. Examples of revolutionary ionization methods, for example, include 
electrospray ionization, which has been key to the major expansion of liquid chromatography coupled with mass 
spectrometry, and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization, which has been key to advances in ion imaging. 
Major developments in instrumentation have included advances in time-of-flight mass spectrometry and Fourier 
transform mass spectrometry approaches, particularly with the electrostatic ion trap referred to as the OrbitrapTM. 
Novel ion probes have been introduced, such as electron transfer dissociation and ion mobility. Collectively, 
these developments have enabled a veritable explosion of mass spectrometry applications in the life sciences. 
As a result, the types of measurements that cancer researchers seek to make with mass spectrometry requires 
a growing range of tools and expertise. To address this challenge, in 2018 Purdue coordinated all of the life- 
sciences-oriented mass spectrometry services within the Life Sciences Mass Spectrometry Facility, a shared 
resource of the Purdue Center for Cancer Research. This Facility is comprised of 11 staff and roughly two dozen 
mass spectrometers that support a wide range of measurements relevant to the needs of PCCR members that 
address both qualitative and quantitative questions. The tools and expertise of this Shared Resource are devoted 
to providing for today's research needs of PCCR members as well as adapting to and anticipating future needs."

 Project Summary 
 The mission of the newly formed Targets, Structures, and Drugs (TSD) Program is to accelerate the 
development of novel therapies for cancer treatment through a pipeline that identifies lead compounds or 
macromolecular target structures, and progresses their development by medicinal chemistry lead 
optimization, rational design, and preclinical evaluation using animal models, including naturally occurring 
canine models that are highly reflective of human disease. Purdue Center for Cancer Research (PCCR) 
academic leadership in drug discovery is characterized by development of novel inhibitors for targets validated 
by PCCR scientists. TSD's 50 Program members have shepherded 11 PCCR compounds into human 
clinical trials and 37 compounds (up from 24 at the last review) into preclinical evaluation, including a total 
of 22 canine studies of PCCR leads and novel technologies. Our goal the next grant cycle is to further enhance 
drug development by continuing to enhance therapeutic lead development. The TSD is led by three co-leaders: 
David Thompson (Lead, Medicinal Chemistry cluster), Deborah Knapp (Lead, Target Validation cluster), and 
John Tesmer (Lead, Chemical and Structure Biology cluster). The TSD developmental pipeline is further 
strengthened by the strategic addition of 24 new members since the last review, giving the TSD Program 
robust coverage in each phase of the drug development pipeline. Members of the TSD Program are active 
participants in the NCI Experimental Therapeutics – Chemical Biology Consortium (Thompson, Director), NCI 
Comparative Oncology Clinical Trials Consortium (Childress, Purdue Director), DARPA Make It (Thompson, co- 
Director), as well as NIH T32 Training Grants in Molecular Biophysics - (Tesmer, Director) and Drug Discovery 
(Dai, co-Director). Over this last funding period, TSD faculty have secured $9.7 million in peer-reviewed cancer- 
related support; have published 505 peer-reviewed articles, (25 % high-impact) with 14% intra-programmatic 
and 15% inter-programmatic collaborations (49% inter-institutional). Further, TSD faculty translate their research 
into deliverables, including 53 patents and 5 companies during this latest funding period. 
 To facilitate our goals of advancing PCCR lead compounds, the TSD program plans to: (1) strategically 
deploy programmatic funds to nucleate and support new inter- and intra-programmatic collaborations; (2) 
leverage Purdue's strength in cryo-electron microcopy (cryo-EM) to enhance structure-based drug design and 
target validation; (3) further develop scalable automated continuous synthesis of PCCR leads enabled by 
Boilermaker Health Innovations (BHI); (4) expand lead testing in canine spontaneous cancer models; and (5) 
inspire the continuing development of scientific leaders in cancer research through innovative training. We will 
further these goals by recruiting leading scientists, particularly in the areas of drug discovery, chemical biology, 
and cryo-EM and continue cultivating a transdisciplinary culture through TSD Program gatherings and by hosting

Recent studies have demonstrated that potentially pathogenic commensal populations, namely pathobionts, are enriched in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and contribute to the pathogenesis of both Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). However, the identity of pathobionts and how these pathobionts trigger and/or exacerbate intestinal inflammation remains incompletely understood. The long-term goal of this proposal is to unravel the mechanisms by which IBD-associated pathobionts contribute to inflammatory processes in the gut. In our preliminary experiments, we identified pathobionts that can potently induce secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 from host mononuclear phagocytes. Such IL-1-inducing pathobionts (hereafter called IBIPs) are selectively enriched in CD patients, and the colonization by IBIPs may be linked to the colitogenic capacity of the gut microbiotas. Strikingly, the persistent gut colonization, but not short-term exposure, to IBIPs predisposes the host to exacerbated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Notably, adaptive immunity (T and B lymphocytes) is not required for this “pathogenic training” of the host, suggesting that the persistent colonization of IBIPs may imprint inflammatory memory in innate immune cells or non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells. We demonstrated that the persistent colonization by IBIPs results in myelopoiesis in the bone marrow (BM). Moreover, we found that IBIPs adhere to the colonic epithelium and cause a pore formation. Based on these preliminary results, our central hypothesis is that persistent gut colonization by IBIPs results in a leaky gut and subsequent BM-mediated trained innate immunity through systemically circulated IBIPs or inflammatory mediators induced by IBIPs, such as IL-1. We will test this hypothesis through the following two specific aims: In Aim 1, we will define the impact of IBIPs on the induction of trained innate immunity. We will examine the function and epigenetic modulations of myeloid cells (macrophages and neutrophils) in the colonic mucosa and the BM. Also, we will test the importance of IL-1b in this process. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of IBIP colonization on colonic epithelial integrity. We hypothesized that IBIP colonization could cause epithelial damage, leading to the dissemination of luminal bacteria and/or bacterial factors, which, in turn, imprints pathogenic trained immunity. The rationale for the proposed research is that identifying the precise mechanisms of pathobiont-driven inflammatory responses in IBD will result in new and innovative ways to treat IBD."
10837137,"ABSTRACT
 The prevalence of chronic pain among adults in the United States now exceeds 20% and is even higher
among older adults and those with multiple comorbid conditions. As clinicians have increasingly learned to
avoid opiates for chronic pain, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an essential role as
effective analgesics. Unfortunately, the threat of kidney toxicity from NSAIDs limits their use for pain control,
and there are no options available to mitigate that risk during treatment. As a result, clinicians largely avoid
using NSAIDs in persons who either have chronic kidney disease (CKD) or are at high risk for developing
CKD, regardless of their severity of pain. The premise of this proposal is that NSAID effects on the kidneys can
be monitored through a biomarker guided strategy, and that nephrotoxicity can be detected early among the
subset who would experience deleterious impact on their kidneys. The primary objective of this proposal will be
to build an NSAID Kidney Monitoring Panel from urine and blood biomarkers of kidney tubule health that will
identify the specific sites of NSAID toxicity, distinguish NSAID-induced changes on the kidney, and forecast the
impact on subsequent kidney function declines.
 Current monitoring for NSAID-related kidney toxicity still relies on serum creatinine (SCr), which is
insensitive for early detection, lacks specificity for true kidney injury, and does not measure tubulointerstitial
health, the major site of NSAID action and injury. Without a better strategy, clinicians will continue withholding
NSAIDs from patients in chronic pain. Our research team has experience in deploying a broad panel of urine
and blood biomarkers of kidney tubular function, injury and tubulointerstitial inflammation that enables both the
sensitivity to detect early kidney damage and the specificity to distinguish patterns that are most consistent
with a distinct medication effect. We will apply this strategy among two populations at high risk for developing
NSAID nephrotoxicity. To best characterize the impact of high-dose NSAID use, we will evaluate the UCSF
Axial Spondyloarthritis Cohort (Aim 1), as patients with this condition have few other treatment options and are
also largely free of other kidney risk factors. Second, we will collaborate with the Chronic Renal Insufficiency
Cohort (CRIC) to determine the effects of NSAID initiation and discontinuation on kidney health in this very
high-risk group with moderate-to-severe CKD (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will integrate the findings from each setting
to determine the set of biomarkers that best captures chronic NSAID exposure, dynamic changes in
longitudinal NSAID use, and risks for longitudinal kidney function trajectories.
 This research will unquestionably yield tremendous insights into the incidence and patterns of kidney
tubulointerstitial injury from NSAID use in these two distinct populations. We are optimistic that our findings will
guide future development of an NSAID Kidney Monitoring Panel that will improve the safe and effective
treatment of pain across the spectrum of kidney disease risk."

10875292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The contents of eukaryotic cells are highly dynamic, yet organized spatially and temporally. This is achieved
primarily by the microtubule cytoskeleton and associated transport machinery, whose fundamental nature is
highlighted by the many neurological diseases caused by mutations in them. The overarching goal of my
research program is to understand how this system works at the molecular, cellular, and organismal
scales. My team is highly interdisciplinary and we use in vitro biochemical reconstitution, protein engineering,
single-molecule imaging, proteomics, live-cell imaging, and fungal genetics to achieve our goals. Through
collaborative projects we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to
incorporate a structure-guided approach to understanding intracellular transport, and we develop testable
quantitative physical models of transport. We have made major contributions to determining how the dynein
motor works and is regulated, to developing tools and screening strategies to study bi-directional movement of
cargos on microtubules, and to understanding the regulation of intracellular transport in cells. Fundamental
questions that we will address here include: (1) How does the dynein motor work? Our earlier work revealed
how Lis1, a protein mutated in the neurodevelopmental disease lissencephaly, interacts with dynein and
regulates its mechanochemical cycle. Here, we will focus on determining the mechanistic underpinnings for how
Lis1 promotes the formation of activated dynein/dynactin complexes. We will also explore a new direction—the
role of RNA editing—as a previously undescribed mechanism to regulate dynein and kinesin motors.
Microtubule-based motors move dozens if not hundreds of cargos. (2) How is cargo-specificity achieved? Our
past work used two complementary discovery-based approaches—genetics and proteomics—to identify
molecules responsible for specifying dynein’s many functions. One mechanism revealed by our past work is
organelle hitchhiking, where cargos link to motors indirectly, by attaching themselves to other cargos that are
directly bound to the motors. A second strategy for achieving cargo specificity is the expansion of dynein
activating adaptor genes in vertebrates. However, the molecular connections between most activating adaptors
and dynein’s cargo are unknown. Here, we will determine the mechanisms underlying hitchhiking and the
linkages between the Hook and Ninein families of activating adaptors and their cargos. As an additional approach
to understand how dynein and kinesin link to their cargos, we will visualize these connections in cells in three
dimensions using cryo-electron tomography of endosomes in Aspergillus nidulans and melanosomes in Xenopus
laevis melanophores, two systems where we can use exquisite genetics or chemical tools to control microtubule-
based motility."
10870082,"The eco-bio-developmental (EBD) model of childhood development promotes the use of integrated evidence-
based approaches for the prevention and management of adverse childhood experiences and toxic stress
across the lifespan. The neurobehavioral effects of such exposures herald challenges in academic
achievement, social interaction, and emotional wellbeing. Disproportionate effects of toxic stress in the
learning process contributes to fewer students from under-represented and disadvantaged groups choosing to
follow a career path towards Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). This gap is
enhanced when there is a lack of or a poor level of coordination among service providers, and a buffering
system for these at-risk students. By enhancing a child’s capacity to understand and communicate their needs
with stakeholders, we aim to promote health agency both at the individual and community levels. The goal of
Semilla is to engage children ages 9 – 12 years in the science of their own well-being. The expected broader
impact of Semilla is a healthy community brought by children as agents of change for their own health, then
that of their family and community. This change will be brought about by stepwise strengthening and iteration
of relationships between education, science, medicine, and the community. Our activities flow from a focus on
emotional wellness of participants to their whole-body wellness. As volunteers from the fields of science,
education, and medicine enter into this process with children of their community, they too are changed. Our
specific aims include: 1) Implementation of Semilla Curricula through Boys & Girls Clubs of Puerto Rico; 2)
Recruitment, Training, and Deployment of a fellowship program for educators & scientists for current &
sustained support of the whole body wellness of the Children of Puerto Rico; and 3) Development of a Clinical
Community response to the Health & Wellness Needs of the children of Puerto Rico. The successful
completion of Semilla will achieve a community of science where children from disadvantaged backgrounds
can effectively communicate with professionals in training from various disciplines through a joint experience of
scientific inquiry while the whole community moves toward better health."
10873981,"PROJECT SUMMARY
We previously developed a suite of tools for modulating and studying RNA based on the RNA-targeting CRISPR-
Cas13 system, which has been adopted or extended by many researchers in the life sciences. This proposal
seeks to discover and characterize additional programmable RNA binding proteins and develop them
for use as molecular technologies. In particular, we are focusing on identifying ultra-small Cas13 proteins,
which can be fused to RNA editing effectors to create compact platforms for precision, single-base transcript
editing. RNA editing has significant therapeutic potential across a spectrum of conditions, including genetic
diseases where it is not possible or too risky to edit the genome as well as acute insults where transient genetic
changes are desirable. Thus, another aim is to demonstrate the feasibility of using RNA editing therapeutically.
Beyond RNA editors, we will also use the new proteins we identify to develop transcriptional state sensors, which
can be used to mark specific cell sub-types within a heterogenous population, either for imaging, isolation, or
functional outcomes.
To achieve these goals, we will leverage our previous experience to discover and characterize new RNA
targeting CRISPR systems, with a focus on identifying small enzymes that support RNA editing activity. We will
also explore the possibility of using novel RNA deaminase enzymes in our RNA editing constructs. In addition to
creating RNA editing constructs, we will also fuse the RNA targeting enzymes to GFP or Cre to create
transcriptional sensors. A critical aspect of our work will be protein engineering. Candidate enzymes (or their
RNA components) may need to be modified for efficient, specific activity in mammalian cells. We will use protein
engineering to increase the specificity and activity of RNA deaminases, as well as extend the substrate base
preference of these enzymes. For our transcriptional state sensors, protein engineering will be central to
successfully generating sensors that afford high specificity and high signal-to-noise ratios. All of these efforts will
be guided by structural and biochemical studies of the relevant enzymes.
Finally, we will apply the compact, high-specificity RNA editors in a mouse model of acute liver damage to
demonstrate their therapeutic potential as short-lived, reversible treatments. In parallel, we will demonstrate the
feasibility of using RNA editing to correct a mutation that causes the neurodevelopmental disorder Rett syndrome
using a previously established mouse model of this disease.
This work will substantially advance RNA editing toward clinical use, as well as uncover new biology about
CRISPR systems and other microbial defense systems."
10836578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Persons living with dementia (PLWD) frequently experience sleep problems (e.g., trouble falling and
staying asleep), which may reduce psychological well-being and exacerbate cognitive decline. PLWD are often
supported by their spouses or cohabiting partners who are themselves at increased risk of sleep problems,
psychological distress, and cognitive impairment. Spouses shape one another’s health and well-being in the
context of aging and chronic illness. However, ADRD care research has primarily focused on caregivers’ own
sleep, well-being, and cognitive function, limiting knowledge of how each care dyad member’s experiences
may influence sleep, well-being, and cognitive function within the care dyad. This project will advance the
literature on ADRD care by testing a novel conceptual model within an innovative dyadic intensive longitudinal
design to assess how daily perceived stress and positive experiences are associated with daily sleep as well
as long-term impacts on well-being and cognitive function among couples living with early-stage ADRD.
 The proposed project will recruit 150 married or cohabiting couples aged 60 and older (300 individuals) in
which one partner lives with early-stage ADRD. At baseline, both partners will be asked to complete hour-long
phone interviews and in-person cognitive assessments followed by 7 consecutive days of brief ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) smartphone surveys (5 times a day) and objective sleep tracking using wrist
actigraphy. The hour-long phone interviews and cognitive assessments will be repeated at 1 and 2 years after
baseline with midpoint check-in calls and brief semi-structured data collection at 6 months in between study
waves. We will explore three specific areas of inquiry: First, we will determine whether own and partner reports
of daily perceived stress and positive experiences predict daily sleep (e.g., self-reported sleep quality, objective
sleep efficiency) within ADRD care dyads. Second, we will evaluate whether own and partner daily perceived
stress, daily positive experiences, and daily sleep predict well-being (e.g., depressive symptoms) and cognitive
function (e.g., global cognition) over 2 years within ADRD care dyads. Third, we will examine whether own and
partner daily sleep reactivity (i.e., daily perceived stress-sleep links and daily positive experiences-sleep links)
predicts well-being and cognitive function over 2 years within ADRD care dyads. In all three aims, we will
examine variations by PLWD and spouse reports of psychosocial resources (personal mastery, self-efficacy,
purpose in life, and social support) that may mitigate risk of adverse outcomes. Findings will identify potentially
modifiable mechanisms at the daily level that explain both daily and long-term health outcomes within ADRD
care dyads. Understanding dynamic processes and factors that promote resilience within ADRD care dyads
will inform timely dyadic interventions to improve the health and functioning of PLWD and their spouses."

These services and expertise will be available without charge to NEI R01-funded investigators
and new investigators whose research aligns with the mission of the NEI and IVR. They will be
available to investigators with funding from other NIH agencies as well. This will accelerate the
pace of vision research at The University of Iowa by providing access to high-quality

10890648,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately ~7% of alcohol-consuming individuals engage in chronic heavy drinking (CHD), which is
associated with increased susceptibility to infections as well as impaired wound healing and tissue repair
resulting in poor post-operative outcomes. Evidence suggests that many of these defects are mediated by
excessive inflammatory responses originating from myeloid cells, notably circulating monocytes and tissue-
resident macrophages. These data were primarily generated from in vitro studies where monocytes from healthy
donors or cell lines are treated high doses of ethanol. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of CHD
cannot be fully understood by in vitro studies because immune cells carry out their functions in a multicellular
environment in which alcohol has widespread effects. Due to a lack of studies utilizing reliable in vivo models,
our understanding of the mechanisms underlying aberrant inflammatory responses in the context of CHD
remains incomplete. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose to leverage a rhesus macaque model of
voluntary ethanol self-administration that accurately mirrors human physiology and recapitulates complex human
drinking behavior. Using this model, our lab has recently demonstrated that CHD results in transcriptional and
epigenetic rewiring of circulating monocytes and splenic macrophages, resulting in aberrant responses to LPS
stimulation. However, the functional implications of this reprogramming and the epigenetic mechanisms
controlling it remain unknown. Importantly, because monocytes are short-lived circulating cells under constant
repopulation from the bone marrow, these observations suggest perturbations of the hematopoietic niche.
Preliminary single-cell analyses of hematopoietic progenitors point to a shift in differentiation potential towards
more mature myeloid progenitors with alcohol. However, a link between this observation in progenitor cells and
their differentiated states in blood and tissue remains unclear. In this application, we propose to test the
hypothesis that chronic alcohol consumption reprograms the epigenetic landscape of monocyte
progenitors in the bone marrow giving rise to circulating monocytes poised towards a hyper-
inflammatory response. We will first examine the impact of CHD on functional reprogramming of circulating
monocytes, implementing assays to test their ability to migrate, phagocytose, and generate proper metabolic
responses. We will next examine the effect of stimulation on the monocyte epigenetic landscape through
assessment of chromatin accessibility and abundance of specific histone modifications. Finally, we will determine
the effect of CHD on the differentiation potential, transcriptome activation, and epigenetic rewiring of bone
marrow myeloid progenitors and integrate these data with those obtained from peripheral blood monocytes.
Completion of this proposal will provide novel insight into the impact of CHD on myelopoiesis and mechanisms
by which it compromised immunity and host defense as well as design interventions to mitigate these adverse
events and improve immunological outcomes."
10817246,"Risk of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is higher for non-Latinx Black older adults than for
non-Latinx White older adults. This disparity is not fully explained by commonly measured individual risk
factors such as educational disadvantage, apolipoprotein E epsilon 4, or medical comorbidities. Thus, there is
a critical need to identify additional modifiable targets at multiple levels to reduce ADRD inequalities in line with
NIA's Strategic Directions for Research and the NIA Health Disparities Framework. The overall goal of this
longitudinal study (N=700; 50% Black) is to identify new, modifiable pathways to reduce racial inequalities in
ADRD by leveraging the community-based Michigan Cognitive Aging Project (MCAP), the National
Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA), and recently released historical data from the 1950 census. Our strong
preliminary data support concurrent neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) as a unique driver of cognitive
inequalities that operates through modifiable environmental (e.g., public infrastructure), social (e.g.,
discrimination), psychological (e.g., depressive symptoms), and behavioral (e.g., diet) mechanisms. The
current proposal will follow MCAP participants for a critical third time point to enable latent growth curve
modeling of longitudinal cognitive trajectories, expand the cohort to ensure adequate power for between and
within group longitudinal analyses in the presence of racial disparities in mortality, and collect structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of brain integrity. In addition, this proposal will collect new data
on residential histories to identify life course critical periods for neighborhood level interventions, develop a
novel measure of neighborhood racial income inequality that could predict ADRD risk above and beyond
nSES, and reveal resilience factors among Black older adults that could interrupt ADRD risk pathways. Recent
studies have linked nSES to brain and cognitive outcomes, but the mechanisms, modifiers, and intersection
with racial inequalities in ADRD are not yet understood. Grounded in the bioecological model and a life course
model of ADRD inequalities, our overarching hypothesis is that eliminating racial inequalities in ADRD will
require interventions at multiple levels of the exposome, and the current proposal will provide actionable
knowledge to guide policies and interventions."
10825627,"ABSTRACT
In the United States, alcohol and substance use disorders (AUD and SUD) are highly prevalent and are
established causes of mortality, morbidity, individual and societal costs. There is significant unmet need in
accessible AUD and SUD treatment options, however telehealth is demonstrated to be an effective solution to
addressing barriers to treatment, especially for underserved populations. The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated
a rapid pivot to telehealth by adapting available technologies and deregulating telehealth use as a replacement
to in-person services. Adoption of telehealth for AUD and SUD treatment may be particularly advantageous for
addressing issues of access for medically underserved populations, such as those served by Federally Qualified
Health Centers (FQHCs). Results will identify telehealth policies (i.e., Audio-only Telehealth, Provider Type
Expansion, Service Type Expansion) that were effective during the pandemic to inform lasting changes to health
systems improving access to AUD and SUD services. The central hypothesis is that policies supporting
telehealth during COVID-19 will be positively associated with increased AUD and SUD service utilization in
underserved populations. Our specific aims are as follows: 1. Conduct legal analysis of state Medicaid COVID-
19 telehealth policies; 2. Evaluate state Medicaid telehealth policies on AUD and SUD service utilization at
FQHCs, and 3. Analyze impact of state Medicaid COVID-19 telehealth policies on FQHC special populations.
The study will employ the Center for Connected Health Policy's Policy Finder resource for COVID-19 telehealth
policy data and FQHC program data for outcome data on patient characteristics (e.g., demographic information)
and services provided (e.g., number of visits and number of patients for AUD and SUD services). We will conduct
a series of differences-in-differences models and use other analytic methods using longitudinal data to compare
categorized telehealth policies developed through legal research on state Medicaid telehealth policies. The aims
of the proposed study are inherently innovative as the telehealth policy changes resulting from the COVID-19
pandemic are novel and present a unique opportunity to evaluate the impact of telehealth on AUD and SUD
access and utilization, particularly for underserved populations. Identifying policies that improve access to AUD
and SUD care and treatment will have lasting and significant implications for health services after the pandemic,
such as permanent policy adoption or application to different payors, settings, and populations."
10783816,"ABSTRACT: Depression is one of the most common, costly, and disabling mental disorders and is on track to
be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide by 2030. Exposure to adversity during childhood, such as
abuse, trauma, poverty, or family disruption, can have profound effects on mental health, more than doubling
the risk for depression later in life. These effects are particularly deleterious when they occur during sensitive
periods, developmental windows when life experiences can exert greater influences on future outcomes.
Although the biological mechanisms underlying this increased vulnerability remain unknown, DNA methylation
(DNAm) – a type of epigenetic modification – has emerged as a prime candidate to explain the long-term
effects of childhood adversity and its links to depression. However, the predictive power of single DNAm loci is
limited, and, as such, recent studies have begun to create composite DNAm risk scores (abbreviated as MRS).
Yet, no studies have determined whether sensitive period effects can be integrated into MRS and the extent to
which these MRS of time-varying childhood adversity can predict future depressive outcomes. Here, we
propose to develop and implement novel methodologies to incorporate the time-varying effects of childhood
adversity into MRS, as well as assess the ability of these MRS to explain and predict adult incident depression.
We will analyze data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a longitudinal birth
cohort that has collected repeated, prospective measures of childhood adversity from ages 0-11, DNAm data
in adolescence (age 15-17), and repeated measures of depression between ages 18-28 (n=1,899). In aim 1,
we will develop the methodologies necessary to create MRS of time-varying childhood adversity (denoted
MRSADV) and determine the extent to which these MRSADV capture prior exposures to childhood adversity. To
this end, we will leverage a unique and independent set of summary statistics from our recent meta-analyses
of five different types of time-varying childhood adversity and DNAm, which will be used as independent
weights in our MRS calculations. In aim 2, we will determine the extent to which MRSADV explain subsequent
risk for incident depression, as well as compare the predictive power of MRSADV to self-reports of prior
childhood adversity. In sum, this study will: (1) develop new methodologies that can be leveraged to integrate
time-varying measures into MRS studies; (2) identify novel epigenetic biomarkers of childhood adversity that
can be used to quantify prior exposures to adversity; and (3) determine the extent to which MRS of childhood
adversity predict future psychopathology. These findings will not only provide a novel paradigm for studies of
MRS and epigenetic mechanisms but will also identify biomarkers that can predict the lifelong consequences of
childhood adversity, which will ultimately help target prevention and treatment efforts to people at higher risk
for mental illness. The proposed research will also generate preliminary evidence towards future grants
focused on socio-biological factors that link childhood adversity to mental health across the life course."
10880542,"St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a mosquito borne pathogen that causes febrile illness and sometimes
fatal encephalitis and was a leading cause of infectious encephalitis in the US during the 1970s. After an 11-
year absence in activity in California, SLEV reemerged and reestablished in CA from 2015-2021, and caused
an outbreak in nearby Phoenix, AZ. SLEV reemergence is marked by increasing human cases and positive
mosquito pools across more counties each year, including areas with concurrent activity of West Nile virus
(WNV), a related flavivirus that invaded CA in 2003 and which shares avian reservoirs and Culex mosquito
vectors with SLEV. Genetic tracing by our team showed that reemerging (‘contemporary’) SLEV in the Western
US is genetically distinct from pre-2003 (‘historical’) SLEV and that it likely originated in South America.
However, other than these studies, drivers of SLEV reemergence, including into WNV-endemic areas, have
not been examined. Spread of WNV across the US was facilitated by augmented avian reservoir infection and
vector competence. We propose that similar fitness gains may have enabled SLEV reemergence. The
objective of this project is to assess the extent by which SLEV reemergence is promoted by augmented
infectivity and transmissibility in mosquito and avian cells and mosquito vectors. Higher SLEV activity in
different regions may be explained by differential vector competence for 3 primary Culex vectors (pipiens,
tarsalis, and quinquefasciatus) that favor different environments across the state. We hypothesize that SLEV
reemergence in the Western US since 2015 was mediated by augmented fitness of the introduced genotype in
cells and vectors and that geographic localization is influenced by relative vector competence of 3 primary
Culex species. Viral fitness can be assessed experimentally by comparing SLEV strains using vector
competence and competition assays. The project hypotheses will be tested in 2 project Aims: 1) Determine
transmission competence of contemporary versus historical SLEV in Culex vectors, and 2) Compare relative
fitness of contemporary versus historical SLEV in avian and mosquito cells and vectors. This project is
significant in that it will provide a unique opportunity to compare viral factors involved in the sequential invasion
and spread of 2 Culex-borne flaviviruses, where understanding co-circulation dynamics can be applied to other
sympatric flaviviruses. By defining the role Culex vector species play in SLEV transmission this project will
determine whether augmented infectivity and transmissibility is a factor enhancing reemergence and spread.
To reduce disease, vector control districts can allocate resources towards spatial targeting of the Culex vector
species that exhibit high SLEV competence."
10807058,"Abstract:
Skin cancers, such as melanoma, are among the most mutated human cancers due to the mutagenic action of
ultraviolet (UV) light. The high mutation load in skin cancers makes it challenging to identify driver mutations in
these tumors, particularly in non-coding DNA. For example, recent genome sequencing efforts have identified
dozens of recurrent exon mutations and hundreds of recurrent non-coding mutations in melanomas. However,
current evidence suggests that only a subset of these are under carcinogenic selection and contribute to
melanomagenesis. Many recurrent mutation sites are found in the DNA-binding sites of E26 transformation-
specific (ETS) family of transcription factors (TFs). We and others have recently shown that ETS and other TFs
induce high levels of UV damage, both in UV-exposed cells and in vitro, which can potentially explain the
presence of recurrent mutations at their binding sites. To test this hypothesis, we have developed new capture-
sequencing methods for mapping UV damage at targeted sites in the human genome. We propose to use
these methods to map DNA damage in UV-irradiated skin cells at sites of recurrent mutations in skin cancers.
The overall objective of this proposal is to use targeted UV damage sequencing to distinguish between
recurrent mutations that are simply caused by elevated levels of UV damage (often at TF binding sites) from
those that cannot be explained by UV damage, and therefore are more likely to be oncogenic mutations. In
Aim I, we will use the CPD-capture-seq method to map the formation and repair of UV-induced cyclobutane
pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in UV-irradiated primary skin cells and cancer cell lines. In parallel, will develop a
new method, known as UVDE-capture-seq, to map less common 6-4 photoproducts (6-4PPs) and atypical
photoproducts at sites of recurrent mutations in UV irradiated cells. In Aim II, we will develop a bioinformatics
pipeline to use these capture sequencing data sets to identify candidate non-coding driver mutations by
triaging recurrent mutations associated with elevated UV damage. While it is possible that a few of the
recurrent mutations associated with elevated UV damage could contribute to carcinogenesis, multiple lines of
evidence suggest that the vast majority of these are passenger mutations. In parallel, we will functionally
characterize candidate non-coding driver mutations identified from our preliminary CPD-capture-seq data. We
will also determine whether UV damage induction due to transient ETS TF binding causes a subset of
recurrent exon mutations in melanoma and other skin cancers. Successful completion of these aims will
provide a new method for identifying driver mutations in skin cancers, particularly in non-coding DNA.
Importantly, the methods developed in this proposal could be adapted to analyze different classes of DNA
damage associated with recurrent mutation sites in other cancer types."
10786144,"Summary
In this proposal, we will explore the role of prenylation in antiviral immunity. Prenylation is a post-translational
modification that renders proteins hydrophobic, thus targeting them to the endomembrane. While the role of
prenylation in immunity is unclear, our preliminary data shows compelling evidence that prenylation is a
modification widely used in innate antiviral immunity. As both the host and virus utilize prenylation and the
cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, we propose a dynamic host-pathogen interaction at this interface. We
hypothesize that prenylation could be a potent host innovation to counter viral pathogenesis. This is based on
in silica analysis that revealed an enrichment of immunity-related proteins with a prenylation motif. We
followed in-silica analyses with a biochemical screen and identified several prenylated antiviral proteins that
are involved in interferon responses and virus restriction, with potential to affect virus entry, replication, and
egress. In this grant, we propose to identify the functional consequences of prenylated proteins on subcellular
localization, interferon signaling, and antiviral function. By perturbing specific enzymes in the prenylation
pathway, we will study its effect on interferon response, antiviral effectors, and virus control. This work will
provide novel insights into cell-intrinsic antiviral countermeasures and the development of novel antiviral drug
targets."
10880556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly infectious disease that kills over 1.7 million people per year. The
majority of individuals are able to control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, yet others are
extremely vulnerable. Life-threatening disease symptoms, including extreme weight loss or cachexia,
are also heterogenous across individuals. Immunocompromised people are particularly susceptible to
TB, and less extreme variations in immune system function may also contribute to susceptibility. The
mammalian gut microbiome is a complex community of microbes with extreme variation across
individuals. Gut microbiome composition impacts immune function and susceptibility to a variety of
pathogens. Our pilot data suggests that genetically identical mice with distinct gut microbiomes have
altered ability to control Mtb infection. In this proposal we will interrogate the role of the microbiome in
Mtb control and cachexia. First, we will expand our comparison of mice from different housing
conditions to determine the extent of variation in Mtb burden. To confirm the role of the microbiome in
Mtb infection control, we will transplant fecal microbiomes of interest into germ-free mice and repeat
Mtb infection. We will also profile the immune response to infection in each case. Second, we will
explore the role of the gut microbiome in mediating TB associated cachexia by measuring microbial
and metabolic changes over time in genetically identical mice with diverse microbiomes. In follow up,
we will isolate gut bacteria of interest from these microbiomes to investigate how microbial
metabolism may impact immune function. This proposal will open up a new area of research to probe
the role of the gut microbiome in the pathogenesis of TB. This research has the potential to identify
new microbial and host directed therapeutic targets for TB prophylaxis and treatment."
10911804,"With limited treatment options, apathetic symptoms often experienced by patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD),
related dementias (ADRD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), significantly impact the quality of life of patients and
caregivers. Despite a well-grounded understanding of the essential roles played by frontal cortical and
subcortical structures on the apathy syndrome and on goal-directed behavior (GDB), lingering gaps remain on
the causal links from neurodegeneration to the development of apathy. Thus, the fragmented understanding of
the cognitive and neuroanatomical basis of apathy, stands on the way of developing neuro-biologically targeted
treatments for this debilitating neuropsychiatric issue across dementias. While our long-term goal is to develop
an effective treatment for apathy in ADRD and PD, the overall objectives of this application are to (i) test whether
the effects of focal neurodegeneration leading to apathy in ADRD and PD can be explained by differences in
reward and effort sensitivity - cognitive processes integral to GDB, and (ii) in PD participants referred to receive
deep-brain stimulation surgery (DBS), who are known to later develop high rates of apathy, directly test whether
stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and connected frontal-subcortical circuits, would result in
immediate changes in GDB. The central hypothesis is that, regardless of the primary neuropathology or location
along the neural circuit, both atrophy, observed as structural and functional connectivity changes, and electrical
stimulation along the prefrontal-basal ganglia network, directly alter GDB and manifest as apathy. Two
independent aims are proposed: Aim 1. With all three study populations combined (PD n=100, FTD n=50, and
AD n=100), evaluate the independent effects of reward and effort sensitivity as a mechanistic link between
neurodegeneration of basal ganglia-to-frontal network and the development of specific dimensions of apathy, by
identifying the neuroanatomical underpinnings for (A) each of the three dimensions of apathy as measured by
Dimensional Apathy Scale (DAS), which provides subscores for three apathy dimensions, and (B) reward and
effort sensitivity from the Apple Gather task (AGt), and (C) evaluating reward and effort sensitivity as explanatory
mediators for neuroimaging metrics and apathy dimensions. The AGt is a 30-minute computer administered
effort-based decision-making paradigm in which rewards are weighed against effort. Consistent with the RDoC
framework, the AGt allows a mechanistic approach to apathy by dissociating components of GDB with distinct
neuroanatomical substrates. In Aim 2, for PD-DBS participants, determine whether electrical manipulation of the
STN directly alters reward and effort information processing and consequently GDB. To demonstrate a causal
effect of DBS on changes in motivated behavior in PD participants, while `on' dopaminergic medications, we will
assess their performance on AGt at three time points: (i) baseline, and 6-months postoperatively with (ii) DBS-
OFF and (iii) DBS-ON. Overall, this study will identify tangible therapeutic targets for novel interventions (i.e viral
vectors, focused ultrasound), and thus, enable clinicians to manage apathy in dementia-related conditions."

 Lung cancer is a prevalent cancer type that leads to more deaths than the next four major cancer types
combined. KRAS is one of the most frequent oncogenes in human lung cancer. Despite more than 30 years of
biochemical and cell culture studies, as well as correlative studies on human tumors and clinical trials,
therapeutic options for patients with oncogenic KRAS-driven tumors are just beginning to emerge. KRAS is
often mutated at codons 12 and 13, but these mutations are diverse and these different mutant forms of KRAS
have dramatically different biochemical features. By integrating conventional genetically-engineered mouse
models and CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic genome engineering with quantitative genomics and mathematical
modeling, we recently established CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches that enable the generation and
quantitative analysis of multiple tumor genotypes in parallel in vivo. By employing homology directed repair in
somatic cells, we induce a panel of oncogenic Kras variants, and uncovered an unexpectedly dramatic
difference in oncogenic potential of different Kras variants in vivo. In addition to the diversity of different
oncogenic KRAS variants, the compendium of important pathways downstream of oncogenic KRAS remains
relatively poorly understood. The goals of this proposal are 1) to use genomic and pharmacological methods to
generate a quantitative understanding of different signaling requirements in cancers driven by different Kras
variants and 2) to uncover novel functional regulators of Kras-driven carcinogenesis. To understand the basis
for the differential oncogenic potential of different oncogenic Kras variants, we will use our multiplexed genetic
approaches to quantify the impact of increasing either overall Kras signaling or discrete downstream pathways
on the in vivo tumorigenic potential of diverse oncogenic Kras variants. We will also use therapeutic treatments
to uncover the requirement for sustained PI3K and Raf/Mek/Erk signaling in established lung tumors driven by
diverse Kras variants. Finally, to expand our understanding of Kras-driven tumorigenesis beyond the canonical
effect pathways, we will directly analyze the function of novel Kras-interacting proteins on lung tumor growth in
vivo. By performing multiplexed genomic and pharmacologic analyses of oncogenic Kras signaling in cancer,
we will uncover the molecular mechanisms that contribute to tumor growth driven by different variants of
KRAS. We will define specific therapeutic sensitivities of lung tumors driven by diverse oncogenic mutations.
Our proposed research is significant because it will uncover interesting new areas of biology, motivate
genotype-directed clinical trials, and facilitate precision cancer therapy for lung cancer patients with KRAS-
mutant tumors."
10851959,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is known to cause severe bacterial
infections and spreads rapidly, creating outbreaks that are public health emergencies. CA-MRSA often contain
bacteriophage genetic material, but unless the phage encodes for a known secreted toxin, their contribution to
virulence and strain fitness is largely unknown. In this proposal, we will fill this knowledge gap by leveraging an
epidemic CA-MRSA clone to identify phage-encoded gene(s) and mechanism(s) of bacteria-phage interaction
underlying CA-MRSA contagion. We recently characterized an evolved CA-MRSA strain (USA300-BKV) causing
an epidemic of severe skin infection involving a community of predominantly healthy children in Brooklyn, NY.
Sequencing revealed the major change antecedent to the dispersion of USA300-BKV was acquisition of a
prophage containing a mosaic block of novel genes (mΦ11). We engineered isogenic strains and showed mΦ11
produced significantly larger skin abscesses in mice than strains containing wild type Φ11 or control strain
without phage. However, mΦ11 does not encode for any known virulence factors and the presence of mΦ11 did
not affect in vitro growth, cytotoxicity, exoprotein production, or transcriptional profiles. Subsequent preliminary
studies showed that deletion of a mΦ11-encoded methyltransferase (MTase) decreased the size of the skin
abscesses to that of control strain. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that 1) a mΦ11-encoded
MTase is activated during infection to cause increased virulence and 2) MTase and/or additional mΦ11 gene(s)
enhance CA-MRSA virulence through regulation of bacterial virulence factors. To test these hypotheses, we will
identify the bacteriophage gene(s) responsible for enhanced virulence (Specific Aim 1) by 1) complementing
MTase into the deletion clone to confirm the functional relevance of MTase, 2) constructing a phage induction
repressor mutant to evaluate the effect of induction in vivo, and 3) creating deletion clones in USA300-BKV to
examine the effect of the clinical genetic background on the skin infection phenotype. To define the phage-
mediated virulence mechanism (Specific Aim 2), we will 1) compare alpha toxin production of mΦ11 lysogens to
wild type CA-MRSA during mouse skin infection, 2) perform in vivo transcription profiling using RNA sequencing
to identify additional mΦ11 candidate regulatory targets, and 3) delete and complement candidate regulatory
targets, with a focus on known virulence and regulatory pathways, for testing in a mouse skin infection model.
We expect the independent but complementary Specific Aims will reveal a prophage-encoded mechanism of
virulence in a clinically relevant strain causing an epidemic of CA-MRSA. The results will broaden our
understanding of phage interactions with the host-bacterial genome and strengthen the paradigm that phages
impact virulence in more complex ways than acting as simple toxin carriers. Importantly, identifying the
prophage-encoded gene(s) and mechanisms contributing to CA-MRSA contagion promises to inform outbreak
surveillance measures and discover novel therapeutic targets to combat this substantial pathogen."

An estimated 305,800 babies are born worldwide each year with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), with nearly
75% of births in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite this high incidence, there are currently no effective
public health programs in SSA countries focused on SCD. As a consequence, up to 90% of infants with
SCD in SSA are believed to die needlessly by five years of age. Evidence from high income countries
indicates that interventions such as newborn screening and penicillin prophylaxis can reduce
preventable deaths due to SCD in SSA. Such programs are credited with an ~70% reduction in mortality
rate among children with SCD in the USA. However, the death rate in adult SCD patients in the USA
has not improved in the last thirty years, due to multi-organ complications. There is thus a major need
for research to develop effective therapies across the life span for SCD in all parts of the world. High
regional disease prevalence in SSA would be expected to facilitate research studies on SCD. In 2017,
we established the Sickle Africa Data Coordinating Center (SADaCC) to support the activities of the
Sickle Pan African Research Consortium (SPARCo) sites in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ghana.
This U24 application seeks to continue SADaCC activities to sustain, enhance, and grow the SCD
Network in Africa, in order to advance SCD-related epidemiological, translational, and clinical
research. This overall objective will be accomplished by five specific aims: Aim 1: To provide overall
coordination and administrative support to the SCD SSA Network, that will include: the facilitation
of interactions and functions, and further development of SOPS and websites; Aim 2: To ensure
maintenance and expansion of the centralized electronic sickle hemoglobinopathy database that
will include: updating data capture forms and registry SOPs; a secure and scalable system for data
collection Aim 3: To provide data management support including: and developing the public-use
quality controlled data sets; a repository management system for biospecimens; the enforcement of
country-specific human subject research regulations. Aim 4: To provide expertise and support for
implementation of research studies, including: planning, design, execution, analysis, reporting,
publication, and dissemination of research studies. Aim 5: To provide effective consortium-wide
participatory milestones and metrics for the SCD Research Network performance and impact. The
SADaCC team’s successful experience as the coordinating center for SickleInAfrica augurs its provision
of sustainable support to an expanded SCD Research Network."
10865119,"ABSTRACT
Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) causes nearly 5% of all cancers worldwide and is implicated in 95% of cervical
and 70% of oropharyngeal cancers (OPC). Curative platinum-based chemoradiation is the standard of care for
patients with locally advanced cervical and OPC but patients with cervical cancer have significantly worse
survival despite sharing the same viral etiology. Thus, there are significant differences in the radiation response
between, and within, these two HPV+ cancers yet we continue to treat all patients similarly without consideration
of individual tumor biology. Patients with HPV+ and HPV- cancers are also treated identically despite the
significantly worse outcome of HPV- cancers in both sites. It is therefore imperative to gain a better understanding
of tumor biology in order to tailor radiotherapy to improve patient outcomes and minimize toxicity. Chromosomal
instability (CIN) is an ongoing rate of chromosome missegregation events over the course of multiple cell
divisions, and when increased beyond a certain threshold can lead to cell death due to loss of both copies of
one or more essential chromosomes. We, and others, have shown that very high levels of CIN are associated
with cell death, tumor suppression, and improved prognosis in certain cancers. Moreover, combining two sources
of CIN can increase it beyond the viable threshold resulting in cell death. Because both HPV and radiation induce
certain types of CIN, I hypothesize that cells with pre-existing CIN will be more sensitive to radiation. Additionally,
both CIN and radiation can induce innate and adaptive immune responses which are expected to affect overall
treatment response, but predictive markers and mechanistic insights are lacking. This proposal aims to 1) define
the types and extent of CIN caused by different HPV genotypes and viral oncogene levels, 2) determine if pre-
existing CIN sensitizes HPV+ and HPV- cells to radiation in vitro, in vivo, and in patient tumors, and 3) determine
how CIN affects innate and adaptive immunity in the context of radiation. Together, this proposal aims to
determine HPV+ and HPV- tumor intrinsic and extrinsic factors that affect radiation response such that tumor
and host biology can be incorporated into radiation treatment paradigms to decrease toxicity and increase cure.
Dr. Cosper is a post-doctoral fellow in Radiation Oncology and will use this award to gain expertise in virology,
chromosomal instability and immunology, in order to determine biomarkers that allow for personalization of
radiotherapy. Dr. Cosper’s mentorship team consists of world-renowned experts in HPV virology (Dr. Paul
Lambert), CIN (Dr. Beth Weaver), head and neck cancer radiobiology (Dr. Randall Kimple), and tumor
immunology (Dr. Doug McNeel). The academic environment at the University of Wisconsin is superb, with
abundant resources and collaborative opportunities. Further mentorship and training afforded by this award will
provide Dr. Cosper a unique set of skills that will enable novel translational research to personalize radiation
treatment for head and neck and cervical cancer patients and result in transition to a successful independent
investigator."
10862664,"As key governors of tissue integrity, macrophages are implicated in many age-related diseases. Macrophages
are a plastic myeloid immune cell type found in nearly every tissue of the body where they perform critical
functions for homeostasis. Tissue-resident macrophages adapt to perform specific functions through the action
of tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) that respond to signals in the local environment. In combination with
cell-type-specific TFs, they specify a distinct epigenomic landscape leading to tissue-specific gene expression.
Changes to the macrophage environment due to systemic inflammation and other signals in aging lead to a
decline in macrophage function. In order to develop preventative strategies, we need a better understanding of
how macrophages are altered in aging. However, parsing out the exact signals responsible and their indirect
effects in an intractable problem. Instead, we have the opportunity to take advantage of functional genomic
approaches to identify the downstream regulators, such as TFs and enhancers, that lead to age-related
dysregulation. In this proposal, we will use macrophages in the synovium of murine ankle joints and
computational approaches to model an aging tissue. The synovial compartment largely consists of long-lived
tissue-resident macrophages but the contribution of monocyte-derived cells that originate in the bone marrow
increases with age. Our preliminary analysis of the age-associated epigenomic landscape of bone marrow
monocytes revealed increased activity of chromatin remodelers and decreased activity of cell-type-specific TFs.
Similarly, we observe a decrease in tissue-resident synovial macrophages in the aging joint and a shift in the
transcriptional profile towards monocyte-derived macrophages. Thus, we hypothesize that the aging synovial
macrophage phenotype is driven by replacement with monocyte-derived cells that fail to acquire tissue-
resident regulators due to epigenomic reprogramming by the aging bone marrow micro-environment. In
Aim 1, we will assess age-associated changes to the synovial macrophage compartment over time. We will
perform ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and scRNA-seq on monocyte-derived and tissue-resident macrophages
subpopulations to profile their epigenomic landscape across time. By a combination of clustering and supervised
approaches, we will identify temporal patterns of epigenomic reprogramming and implicate specific TFs that
drive aging in each subpopulation. In Aim 2, we will quantify the impact of cell intrinsic vs. bone marrow micro-
environment on aging monocyte-derived macrophages. Through analysis of their epigenomic profile, we will
identify key enhancers and TFs in their genomic context. Moreover, we will compare the results with additional
chimeras where TNF, one of the key signals in the aging environment, and its receptors are blocked. Together,
these aims will identify key downstream regulators that drive macrophage dysfunction in aging mice with the
ultimate goal of translating of our findings to human patients. Our results will provide a better understanding of
the aging immune system and potential targets for interventions that improve health in aging."

Mechanosensitive Piezo ion channels enable eukaryotic cells to sense mechanical forces. In
vertebrates, two Piezo homologs, Piezo1 and Piezo2, play central roles in all major physiological
systems and are associated with numerous diseases including hypertension, xerocytosis,
lymphedema, arthrogryposis, inflammation, pain, and cancer progression. Hence, pharmacological
modulation of specific Piezo homologs could help treat many human ailments. Yet, this effort is
currently limited by the paucity of homolog-selective pharmacological agents and the lack of a
clear molecular understanding by which Piezo channels open and close their pore in response to
physical and chemical stimuli. To bridge this gap, this proposal will leverage a recently identified
pharmacological binding site in mammalian Piezo1 channels. Specifically, we will use reverse
genetics, high-resolution electrophysiology, and calcium imaging to dissect structural pathways
by which the binding of the small molecule Yoda1 energetically promotes an open state (Aim 1).
In parallel, we will deploy an innovative, multi-pronged approach combining binding free energy
calculations, structure-activity relationships, machine learning-based virtual screening of ultra-
large billion-compounds library, and rapid experimental screening assays to identify novel
molecules that preferentially bind conducting or non-conducting channel conformations, thus
potentially acting as Piezo1 activators and inhibitors, respectively (Aim 2). Successful completion
of this project will identify discrete mechanotrasnduction pathways associated with
pharmacological activation of Piezo1 channels and identify novel pharmacological activators and
inhibitors of Piezo1 channels with potential research and clinical value."

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, modifies the cells that it infects in profound ways.
One such modification is the activation of host cellular mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which
contribute to severe inflammation that is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 disease. Inhibition of one MAPK
pathway, the p38/MAPK pathway, reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication by an undefined mechanism. This proposal
aims to measure the impact of human MAPK pathways on SARS-CoV-2 infection using a multidisciplinary
approach that combines state-of-the-art proteomics technologies, medium-throughput genetic screening, and in
vivo and ex vivo models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These findings will inform the potential application of MAPK
inhibitors for COVID-19 treatment and may identify alternative targets within the MAPK families. MAPK pathways
play critical roles in many disease states, and this work will inform research in these areas by providing molecular
mechanisms for MAPK regulation and providing tools for the unbiased discovery of MAPK substrates and
regulators."
10915434,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide and glia-driven neuroinflammation is a key element in the
pathogenesis of glaucoma. Increasing evidence from clinical studies indicate that primary open-angle glaucoma
is linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
subunit I of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex-IV, ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 and
Cholesterol-24S-hydroxylase, suggesting that TLR4-mediated neuroinflammation, cholesterol efflux and/or
OXPHOS stress-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction play roles in glaucoma pathogenesis. ApoA-I binding
protein (AIBP), encoded by the APOA1BP gene, is a secreted protein, which serves as a selective regulator of
cellular cholesterol metabolism, targeting inflammatory cells via its binding to TLR4. Cholesterol depletion from
inflammatory cells reduces lipid raft abundance and the membrane occupancy of receptors (such as TLR4) that
mediate inflammatory signaling. Emerging evidence from our group showed that AIBP deficiency is associated
with glia-driven inflammatory TLR4/interleukin-1β signaling axis and mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucomatous
degeneration. In addition to protecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) against neuroinflammation, AIBP prevents
RGC mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. In preliminary studies, we demonstrated
that AIBP expression is highly reduced in glaucomatous human and mouse RGCs and their axons, as well as
Müller glia, and that amplification of retinal AIBP expression by adeno-associated virus delivery protects RGCs
and preserves visual function in experimental glaucoma in vivo. In addition, treatment with recombinant AIBP
protein promotes mitochondrial function in Müller glia against elevated pressure in vitro. Based on our previous
and these findings, we propose to test the novel concept that AIBP controls retinal neuroinflammation and the
RGC mitochondrial dysfunction, which lead to glaucomatous neurodegeneration, as well as to test the
therapeutic potential of raising AIBP expression in the retina. The Specific Aims of this proposal are: (1) to define
the mechanisms by which AIBP controls TLR4-lipid raft activation in inflammatory Müller glial cells; (2) to
determine the protective mechanisms of AIBP amplification on mitochondrial network and bioenergetics in
glaucomatous RGCs and Müller glial cells; and (3) to determine how therapeutic augmentation of AIBP
expression impacts structural integrity and synapses linking RGCs and the central visual pathway. Our proposed
studies will explore novel pathways which potentially link neuroinflammation regulation to elevated IOP-mediated
mitochondrial function and cellular cholesterol metabolism. This work may also lead to the development of a new
glaucoma therapy."
10832691,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by
progressive motor neuron (MN) loss, muscle denervation, and eventually, paralysis. Currently, no effective
treatments are available to stop or reverse ALS disease progression and the precise molecular mechanisms
underlie ALS pathogenesis remain elusive. Prior studies revealed decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain
activity, altered mitochondrial ultrastructure, and mitochondrial dysfunction in both MN and skeletal muscle (SM)
in ALS patients and mouse models. The first sign of ALS pathology occurs at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ),
where presynaptic MN axons connect with postsynaptic SM end plates. To date, whether signals resulting in the
initial NMJ damage are from MN or SM remain unclear. In this project, we aim to determine the tissue-specific
causative role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM and MN in disease onset and progression, and the therapeutic
efficacy of reducing mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake on NMJ and SM function in ALS mice. We hypothesize that
mitochondrial Ca2+ mishandling in both SM and MN actively contribute to ALS disease pathogenesis and that
attenuating mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake mitigates mitochondrial damage and preserves NMJ/muscle function. To
test this hypothesis, we will use transgenic mice with inducible, SM or MN-specific expression of a dominant
negative form of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter to specifically and selectively reduce mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake
in SM and MN in hSOD1G93A mice and C9-500 (C9orf72) mice, two mouse models associated with the most
prevalent genetic causes for ALS. The central hypothesis will be tested in two Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine
the role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM or MN in survival, motor function, NMJ function and in vivo muscle
performance in hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice. Aim 2 will assess the impact of tissue-specific inhibition of
mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM or MN on NMJ and muscle structure, MN survival, muscle intrinsic contractile
properties, mitochondrial structure and mitochondrial bioenergetics in SM of hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice. This
project will: 1) provide a systematic, longitudinal characterization of SM and NMJ function from a cellular level to
whole animal level at different stages of disease progression in hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice; 2) determine the
degrees to which defects in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM or MN contribute to altered NMJ structure/function,
disease onset and progression in hSOD1G93A and C9-500 mice; 3) provide the first detailed dissection on the
relative role of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in SM and MN in ALS phenotype using the same genetic models and
determine the origin of the signals that result in NMJ destruction (from SM or MN or both); 4) provide mechanistic
evidence for whether mitochondrial Ca2+ mishandling is a trigger or a target for disease progression in ALS mice,
regardless of the causing mutations (mitochondrial related or non-mitochondrial related); and most importantly,
5) test the validity of a potential new therapeutic target (mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, or the mitochondrial Ca2+
uniporter) for the treatment of ALS."

In recent years, several chemically diverse compounds have been identified that target PfATP4, a P-type
ATPase involved in maintaining Na+ homeostasis in malaria parasites. Some of these compounds have
advanced to clinical trials. Thus, PfATP4-active compounds are among the most attractive new antimalarials
being developed to counter the continuing threat of drug resistance. Over the previous funding period, we have
discovered some dramatic alterations in parasite physiology that accompany a short 2 h exposure to PfATP4
inhibitors. These include: i) Rapid alterations in lipid homeostasis within the parasites with reversible
accumulation of cholesterol in the parasite plasma membrane (PPM); ii) Morphological changes resembling
premature schizogony; and iii) Massive dephosphorylation of parasite proteins that may underlie the metabolic
slowdown that follows PfATP4 inhibition. These observations reveal a collection of hitherto unknown interrelated
molecular pathways, disruptions of which result in parasite demise. We found that PfATP4 inhibition appears to
result in inhibition of PfNCR1, another druggable transporter, that is involved in maintaining lipid/cholesterol
homeostasis within the PPM. Reduction of cholesterol content of the RBC plasma membrane results in dramatic
expulsion of trophozoites from the host cell without the lysis of the RBC membrane. Remarkably, treatment with
either PfATP4 or PfNCR1 inhibitors prevents this expulsion. These studies suggest an active transport of
cholesterol between the RBC plasma membrane and the parasite. We found that trophozoite stage parasites
exposed to PfATP4 inhibitors for just 2 h undergo massive morphological changes that resemble premature
onset of schizogony events including the formation of inner membrane complexes, rhoptry-like structures and
karyokinesis. In addition, trophozoites undergo massive reduction of a large number of metabolites suggestive
of metabolic shutdown. We hypothesize that underlying all these events is a signaling cascade unleashed by
the influx of Na+ into parasite cytoplasm following PfATP4 inhibition. In support of this proposition, we found
dephosphorylation of a large number of proteins, prominent among which were molecules involved in DNA
metabolism, chromosome segregation and cell cycle processes. The complexity of events triggered by PfATP4
inhibition requires a multidisciplinary approach. For this purpose, we have recruited outstanding co-investigators
in consortium arrangements for the next funding period. Together, we propose to carry out the following specific
aims: i) Investigate the relationship between cholesterol dynamics and its role in fatty acid and lipid transport in
P. falciparum; ii) Explore the significance of dephosphorylation of proteins that follows PfATP4 inhibition; iii)
Examine the causes of metabolic slowdown following PfATP4 inhibition; iv) Derive structural information for
PfATP4 and PfNCR1 to understand molecular details about these validated antimalarial drug targets."

Nearly half of U.S adults have hypertension (HTN), a leading cause of the cardiovascular disease (CVD). HTN
that develops earlier in life contributes to the early development of end-organ damage, thereby increasing the
risk of cardiovascular mortality compared to later-onset HTN. Multiple studies provide evidence for the
hypothesis that environmental factors in utero program patterns of fetal and infant growth that result in
increased susceptibility to HTN later in life. Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is highly prevalent during pregnancy and
has been linked to an increased risk of HTN during childhood. We previously found that macrophage-specific
deletion of the VD receptor during early embryogenesis induced HTN by two mechanisms: a) renal-dependent
by stimulating the secretion of miR106b to drive JG cell renin production and b) renal-independent by
increased macrophage renin production and secretion. Additional studies in rodent models support the role of
maternal VD deficiency in developing HTN and chronic inflammation via epigenetic mechanisms. In this
proposal, we present preliminary data indicating for the first time that HTN is transplantable by immune cells.
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from fetuses exposed to VD deficiency in utero can permanently transfer
HTN to VD-sufficient adult mice. Vitamin D deficiency epigenetically suppresses Jarid2 expression and
activates the Mef2/PGC1α pathway in HSCs, which persists in recipient bone marrow, resulting in
macrophage renin and miR-106b secretion, both of which represent novel mechanisms by which immune cells
contribute to the development of HTN. In humans, we found that this immune cells program causing HTN is
preventable in children monocytes from the VDAART trial by antenatal 4400 IU/day of VD supplementation.
Importantly, children from VD-supplemented mothers have decreased brachial-systolic blood pressure (BP).
Thus, we hypothesize that VD supplementation early in pregnancy prevents epigenetic suppression of Jarid2
expression to avoid the BP-increasing effects of renin and miR106b secretion from myeloid cells. To evaluate
this epigenetic immune program in vivo, we will utilize HSC transplantation models to determine in Aim1 if 1)
Jarid2 deletion is sufficient to induce the HTN phenotype observed in the setting of in utero VD deficiency, 2)
miR106b or renin deletion attenuates the HTN phenotype associated with in utero VD deficiency and 3)
correction of VD deficiency early in pregnancy prevents the development of HTN in offspring. In Aim2, we will
assess the role of maternal VD supplementation on VDAART children’s BP and monocyte
Jarid2/PGC1α/Renin/miR106b pathway activation and determine if plasma miR106b and monocyte RAS
activation are early markers of HTN in children at ages 9-11 from a randomized controlled trial (VDAART) of
antenatal treatment with VD 4400 IU/d vs. placebo. This proposal will provide evidence for maternal early VD
screening and treatment to decrease the incidence of childhood HTN and aim to establish miR106b as a
specific biomarker identifying children at risk for CVD."

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disease that leads to death in 3 years if untreated. PAH
is characterized by remodeling and eventually occlusion of the pulmonary arteries, followed by high PA pressure
and right heart failure. Heterozygous mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 gene (BMPR2)
are the leading genetic cause of PAH. In patients with BMPR2 mutations, PAH develops years earlier, and in a
more severe form, than in patients with normal BMPR2. Notwithstanding the recent progress in identifying the
molecular and cellular consequences of BMPR2 mutations, no targeted therapy for BMPR2 carriers exist, nor
the dire need for novel therapies has been met.
 A well-supported model of BMP signaling starts with a ligand binding to a group of transmembrane
serine/threonine receptor kinases comprised of two type 1 receptor (BMRPI) and two type 2 receptors (BMPR2).
The heterotetrameric active BMP receptor complex phosphorylates Smad proteins that carry the signal
downstream to the nucleus. Gaps in this model include lack of understanding why the receptors need to be
organized in a heterotetramer configuration to be active, and how the receptor kinases are activated.
Consequently, our understanding of prevalent PAH mutations that localize to the BMPR2 intracellular regions
remains unsatisfactory and prohibitive from advancing PAH-targeted therapies. Our recent studies have led to a
discovery that kinase domain of BMPR2 forms a heterodimer with a type 1 BMP receptor kinase. Formation of
the heterodimer is not sufficient to activate the type 1 kinase but is essential for ligand-induced receptor signaling,
suggesting its essential role in assembly of the active receptor tetramer. Importantly, several BMPR2 mutants
linked to PAH map to the heterodimer interface and inhibit ligand-induced downstream Smad signaling,
supporting the physiological significance of the heterodimer interface. The goal of this application is to elucidate
the molecular underpinnings of BMP receptor kinase activation and elucidate how poorly understood BMPR2
mutations trigger PAH by: (i) dissecting the role of the type 1/type 1 kinase oligomerization in the catalytic
activation of the BMP receptor complex, downstream signaling, and vascular homeostasis, and (ii) gaining the
structural understanding of the active type 1/type 2 kinase domain complexes alone and in the context of full-
length BMP receptor tetramers. Upon completion, this study will define the significance of the non-catalytic
interfaces present on BMP receptor kinases and provide insights into how BMPR2 mutations perturb the type
1/type 2 kinase interactions resulting in PAH. This knowledge will provide platform for the development of
innovative novel PAH therapies."

Although cancers have a constitutively increased intracellular pH (pHi) that enables disease progression, the
molecular mechanisms mediating pHi-dependent cancer cell behaviors are understudied and incompletely
understood. During the funding period we bridged protein electrostatics and cell biology to identify molecular
mechanisms for pHi regulating tumorigenesis and metabolic reprogramming, and for conferring cancer-
promoting functions of somatic mutations encoding charge changes in proteins. Our competing renewal applies
our expertise in new directions to address two gaps in our understanding of pHi dynamics and cancer. First is
how pHi dynamics can directly regulate gene expression. Our previous work resolved how pHi dynamics can
regulate protein-phospholipid and protein-protein binding; however, how pHi dynamics can regulate protein-DNA
binding, despite nuclear and cytosolic pH being similar, remains unknown. In Aim 1 we test a new idea on pHi
titration of a histidine in the DNA-binding domain of transcription factors that forms hydrogen bonds with
nucleotides in conferring target gene selectivity. This idea is applicable to at least 65 transcription factors with a
nucleotide-binding histidine. Focusing on three transcription factors from different families, FOXC2, SOX4 and
MAX that have roles in cancers, we will test the hypothesis that dysregulated pHi dynamics in cancer cells
contributes to transcription factor-DNA binding selectivity for enabling cancer cell behaviors. We will
resolve pH regulated affinities of DNA binding domains to recognized DNA motifs, identify pH-dependent
genome-wide binding preferences, and determine pH regulated transcription factor-DNA binding selectivity in
cancer cells. Additionally, we apply our predictions on pHi regulated selectivity of transcription factor-DNA
binding by testing targeting the nucleotide-binding histidine to reactivate a tumor suppressor pathway in cancer
cells. A second gap in our understanding is the role of pHi dynamics and heterogeneity in tumorigenesis. Based
on our preliminary data of intercellular pHi heterogeneity in clonal cancer cell spheroids and organoids of cancer
cells from human biopsies, and established roles for pHi dynamics in epithelial plasticity, cell migratory capacity,
and stem cell differentiation, in Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that pHi heterogeneity distinguishes tumor
cell phenotypic heterogeneity. We will determine whether pHi heterogeneity reflects distinct cell phenotypes
and identities in spheroids of clonal colorectal cancer cells and organoids derived from biopsies of human
colorectal tumors, by transcriptomics profiles generated by single cell RNA-seq and genetically changed pHi. To
resolve pHi dynamics and heterogeneity during tumorigenesis we use a Drosophila line we generated expressing
a genetically encoded pHi biosensor that allows longitudinal imaging of pHi dynamics in vivo, which cannot be
achieved with mouse models. Significant outcomes of our studies include showing for the first time that pHi can
regulate transcription factor-DNA binding selectivity, new insights on emergent tumor cell properties, and clinical
promise for targeting cancer cell pHi for prognostic value and selective delivery of therapeutics."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous and highly persistent chemicals, that have been
used widely in industry for seven decades and are known to adversely influence maternal and child health.
PFAS have recently become a public health priority evidenced by President Biden’s call to action to prevent
the adverse impacts from PFAS present in our air, water, and food supply. Achieving this goal necessitates
monitoring a broad range of PFAS and determining the health effects of realistic scenarios of exposures to
PFAS mixtures, though most prior research has investigated PFAS one at a time. Moreover, data are needed
to inform national policies, and clinical guidelines can only be determined by studying the most susceptible
populations, namely pregnant women and newborns. Therefore, to inform national policies and clinical
guidelines, we propose to investigate the risks associated with prenatal exposure to PFAS in the New
Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, a large rural U.S. cohort of over 2,400 mother-infant dyads with anticipated
enrollment of 3,000. We will investigate the effects of PFAS, measured in maternal blood during pregnancy, on
placental features and birth size, which is a sentinel outcome, with both insufficient and excessive fetal growth
contributing to infant morbidity and mortality and enduring risk of cardiovascular and metabolic morbidity well
into adulthood. We will leverage extensive extant data from our decade-long cohort, including toxicant
exposure and clinical metadata. We will test the hypothesis that PFAS, alone and as mixtures, adversely affect
placental features and reduce size at birth. Further, we will explore whether associations of PFAS with size at
birth are mediated by the influence of PFAS on the placenta. Our work will integrate advances in statistical
methodologies for evaluating exposure mixtures and evaluate PFAS for which effective federal regulations do
not yet exist."
10837121,"Brain photobiomodulation (PBM) using near-infrared (NIR) light is a promising new approach for treating
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite the high interest in using PBM to treat AD, its application is currently
hindered by the insufficient understanding of the mechanisms of NIR light actions in the brain.
Additionally, NIR-I light (650-900 nm) has not achieved clinical significance due to its insufficient
penetration into the brain tissue. We hypothesize that the key mechanisms underlying treatment
properties of NIR light in AD include the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the
brain, increase of nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial cells, vasomotion, increase of glymphatic
flow, and reduction of amyloid β load and tau pathology. Further, we hypothesize that these
mechanisms can be markedly enhanced by the pulsation of NIR-II light (1000-1700 nm) at a low
frequency during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Our specific aims are designed to test the key
elements of this hypothesis. We plan to test that NIR light treatment is most efficient when it is delivered
in NIR-II window and during NREM sleep (aim 1), that the rate of NIR light stimulation rather than its
duration determines the efficiency of the PBM treatment in AD (aim 2), and that eNOS is the key
mediator of therapeutic effects of NIR light in AD, whereas neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) is not
(aim 3). Thus, we propose a series of translational studies that are aimed to improve our understanding
or the role of NIR light in reducing the AD pathology as well as to identify the way of NIR light delivery
that is most efficient in treating AD."
10932154,"Project Summary / Abstract
Heavy maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is known to interfere with normal fetal development and
is the leading cause of disabilities and premature mortality in children. On the other hand, moderate level of
maternal alcohol consumption (blood alcohol concentration < 0.08%) is thought to be less disruptive to
neurodevelopment. However, it is still unclear whether such moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) has any
adverse effect on the brain function of the adult offspring. Our preliminary data now indicate that moderate PAE
could lead to depletion of endogenous glutathione (GSH) level in the brain of the adult mice offspring and also
diminish the function of a brain-enriched and neuron-specific tyrosine phosphatase, STEP that has been shown
to be involved in neuroprotection against excitotoxic insults. The preliminary data also provide compelling
evidence that a mild ischemic insult in adult PAE offspring leads to exacerbation of ischemic brain injury and is
associated with up regulation of inflammatory response in the brain. These findings raise the possibility that
moderate PAE has a life-long impact on the antioxidant defense system in the brain of the offspring. The resulting
higher basal level of oxidative stress could compromise the ability of the brain to compensate when exposed to
a neurological insult in later stages of life leading to augmentation of brain damage. To test this novel hypothesis,
in Aim 1 we propose to evaluate the impact of moderate PAE on the synthesis and turnover of GSH, generation
of reactive oxygen species and function of STEP in different brain regions of adult, middle-aged and aged PAE
mice offspring. Our approach will include the non-invasive Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) imaging
technique and a multitude of molecular and biochemical studies, utilizing both male and female PAE offspring
with age-matched non-PAE control group. The proposed studies in Aim 2 will utilize magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) and a battery of behavioral tests for noninvasive and longitudinal evaluation of the progression and severity
of ischemic brain damage in adult and aged PAE mice offspring from both sexes. These studies will further
evaluate whether loss of function of STEP could contribute to the exacerbation of ischemic brain injury in PAE
offspring. At the molecular level, the proposed studies in Aim 3 will further delineate the causal link between the
high basal level of oxidative stress and exacerbation of ischemic brain injury in both male and female PAE
offspring. Our approach will utilize flow cytometry, quantitative PCR, immunohistochemical and pharmacological
studies, as well as multiple knockout mice. The proposed research is significant since it will addresse a significant
gap in our knowledge on the life-long health risks of moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy."
10829941,"There is a critical need to develop a new device to noninvasively treat mesh infections without removing the
mesh. In the absence of such a device, the treatment of many mesh infections will remain highly invasive and
costly. This study's objective is to develop cavitation-based histotripsy to treat surgical mesh infections.
Histotripsy generates/excites a cloud of micron sized bubbles in the tissue which mechanically shred the targeted
cells. The physics of microbubble collapse promotes lysis of bacteria attached to the implant enhancing the
destruction of the bacteria biofilm causing the infection.
 Specific Aim #1: Improve pulsing scheme to reduce the impact of cavitation memory. We hypothesize that
adding lower amplitude pulses will reduce cavitation memory in our application as well drastically reducing
treatment times. The impact of the exposures on mesh properties will also be determined for the different
exposure conditions.
 Specific Aim #2: Improve mesh Contrast. We hypothesize that it will be easier to visualize the mesh if we
combine shear-wave and pulse echo imaging and/or increase mesh contrast by adding glass microspheres to
the polypropylene fibers. Increasing the contrast may also increase the effectiveness of our therapy by providing
a stronger reflection off the mesh increasing the pressure fields in the immediate vicinity of the mesh.
 Specific Aim #3: Test therapies safety and effectiveness in an animal model. We hypothesize that our
therapy will be able to treat bacteria biofilms on hernia mesh safely and effectively in an animal model. This
hypothesis will be evaluated by implanting infected mesh samples in a swine model at varying implant locations
and depths while also carefully assessing the tissue for any unintended damage.
 This project is significant because once developed thousands of patients each year would have an alternative
to invasive surgery for treating mesh infections. In addition, improving mesh contrast could improve patient care
even when no infection develops. Once feasibility has been shown for mesh infections, numerous other
implanted devices may be candidates for our same histotripsy-based treatment."
10868696,"ABSTRACT- PROJECT 1. Disparities in cancer prevention and outcomes by poverty status are rooted in
structural and intermediate social determinants of health (SDH), including neighborhood built and social
environments. Features of the built environment (e.g., walkability, safety, healthcare facilities) and the social
environment (e.g., collective efficacy) have major implications for cancer risk through behaviors such as
physical activity and access to preventive care. Adverse neighborhood conditions also exacerbate the stress
response, in the form of high allostatic load, which is a risk factor for many cancers. This is a problem in
persistent poverty (PP) areas where adverse neighborhood conditions are highly prevalent. However, despite
compelling evidence that the living (built and social) environment impacts health-related behaviors and
outcomes, including cancer, there are virtually no interventions that determine to what extent modifications of
the neighborhood built and social environments reduce cancer risk. The proposed study aims to fill this
knowledge gap. We propose a 5-year research project to implement Cancer Prevention through Enhanced
EnvironMent (Cancer PREEMpT), to test whether a comprehensive community intervention that improves the
neighborhood built and social environments can reduce cancer risk in PP areas. The specific aims of Cancer
PREEMpT include: 1) Implementing Cancer PREEMpT and assessing whether the enhancement of living (built
and social) environments leads to increased public safety, use of parks and community spaces, community
events, and prevention services; 2) Determining the effect of improved living environments on community-level
perceptions and behaviors related to cancer risk, such as walkability and safety, self-reported physical activity,
social cohesion and collective efficacy, and use of preventive care and cancer screening; and 3) Evaluating the
impact of improved living environments on self-reported and objective chronic stress (including allostatic load}
and healthcare utilization (including cancer screening). Using a multisectoral approach to bring together
citizens, organizations, businesses, and local governments to improve their living environment, the theorybased
Cancer PREEMpT intervention will engage community members in five adjacent, urban PP census
tracts in Bessemer, Alabama. After a community-engaged needs assessment, modifications will be made in
the built and social environments, followed by an evaluation in Year 5. We will apply sequential explanatory
mixed methods assessments using a two-group design with independent samples of 300 residents at pre(
Year 1) and post-intervention (Year 5), and focus groups with residents. Finally, to ascertain impact on health
care utilization, we will compare Electronic Health Records of all residents of the target area receiving care
through the UAB Health System with residents of control urban PP communities similar in racial make-up.
Cancer PREEMpT will fill a research gap by providing evidence for reduced cancer risk in PP areas through a
community-engaged, stakeholder-supported intervention that improves the living environment."
10868699,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 2. Cancer survivors living in persistent poverty (PP) areas suffer greater cancer disparities which are magnified in non-Hispanic Black (hereafter Black) populations. In PP areas, Social Determinants of Health (SDH), including poor living environments have negative behavioral consequences such as poor diet, physical inactivity, and obesity. Implementing programs that counter these health behavior consequences require contextual adaptation and multilevel implementation strategies that target upstream factors (poor physical and social environment, etc.) contributing to disparities. Yet, we know of no prior efficacious diet and physical activity intervention for cancer survivors and their co-survivors (friends and family) that has been adapted and implemented in the specific PP context using multilevel implementation strategies. Thus, the overall goal of this application is to reduce health disparities experienced by cancer survivors and their co-survivors living in primarily Black PP areas by improving health behaviors. To achieve this goal, we will use established Implementation Science frameworks and significant input from multiple local stakeholders to adapt two efficacious interventions into a new community-delivered LEAP Program, and implement and evaluate this program. Our specific aims are: Aim 1 -Adapt efficacious diet and physical activity interventions designed for cancer survivors (and their co-survivors) to the PP context and SDH. Building off two efficacious diet and physical activity interventions for cancer survivors (and their co-survivors), BEAT Cancer and RENEW, we will adapt them into the LEAP Program. The adaptation process will focus on acceptability, feasibility, sustainability, and SDH in PP areas. Aim 2 - Implement the LEAP program in PP areas using multilevel implementation strategies. We will identify implementation strategies, develop a LEAP Implementation Toolkit, and implement the LEAP program. Aim 3 - Evaluate LEAP program implementation in PP areas. Using a mixed methods approach, we will examine 3 types of outcomes: implementation (readiness, reach, acceptability, fidelity, sustainability), service (safety, cost), and client (diet quality, physical activity, body mass index, quality of life). We will use a 2-cluster prospective design in which our work will start in 4 PP census tracts (Cluster 1) and be replicated in the remaining 5 PP census tracts (Cluster 2) where the other Center for Cancer Control in Persistent Poverty Areas (C3P2) project will intervene to improve the living environment (built and social). This will allow us to examine whether PP living environment improvements enhance the adaptation and implementation of the LEAP program. By leveraging the C3P2 infrastructure and efficacious interventions, this project will advance capacity for implementation of health promotion in PP areas."
10868703,"CAREER ENHANCEMENT CORE ABSTRACT
As part of a multifaceted approach to addressing disparities in cancer care, we must ensure that our
researchers are representative of the populations we serve. Because the population prevalence in Persistent
Poverty (PP) areas are from marginalized groups, our goal is to include investigators who are from
demographic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in medicine, such as persons who are Black/
African American, Hispanic/Latinx, from a low-income background, and/or identified as having a disability. The
goal of the Career Enhancement Core (CEC) is tailored to develop research capacity among early-stage, pre-
and post-doctoral researchers. As a career resource, guidance, and training hub of the proposed Center for
Cancer Control in Persistent Poverty Areas (C3P2), we will provide investigators with the resources and
experience to ready themselves for a competitive, independent career in cancer research, including critical
technical and scientific training, training in essential skills for scientific research, connections to experts for
collaboration and networking, and training in writing competitive grant applications to foster new projects. We
will also endeavor to provide a mechanism to harness the strengths of the University of Alabama at
Birmingham (UAB)'s Heersink School of Medicine, the UAB O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the
UAB Minority Health & Health Disparities Research Center by offering opportunities for collaboration in team
science across the cancer continuum. The C3P2 CEC will be achieved by: 1) providing continuing education
opportunities, including workshops, skills enhancement courses, and seminars to assist early career
investigators in career development in cancer research among PP populations; 2) developing and sustaining
participation of a diverse cadre of early-career investigators in the activities of the C3P2, including research
and pilot projects and the larger Persistent Poverty Initiative Network (PPIN); and 3) providing mentoring and
career planning assistance to early-career investigators. Our previous experience and successful network of
mentoring and training programs make UAB uniquely situated to provide the expertise necessary to equip
early-stage investigators with the academic and experiential skills needed to achieve their career goals, while
developing personal relationships with participants to maintain their interest and investment."
10868707,"DEVELOPMENTAL CORE ABSTRACT
The Developmental Core (DC) supports the mission of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB)'s
Center for Cancer Control in Persistent Poverty Areas (C3P2) to reduce the burden of cancer and cancer
disparities in Persistent Poverty (PP) areas by expanding research and research capacity through
implementation and evaluation of multilevel interventions to improve cancer outcomes across the cancer
control continuum from prevention to survivorship. The DC expands research in cancer control in (PP) areas
of Alabama by developing a research program that builds on the overarching research framework and the
proposed research projects. This goal will be achieved by identifying and developing pilot projects in synergy
with the C3P2 Community Advisory board (CAB) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI)'s Persistent Poverty
Initiative Network (PPIN). The DC will bring together C3P2 investigators, including trainees from the Career
Enhancement Core (CEC) and CAB members in a process to identify, select, and prioritize the most relevant
and feasible pilot projects. Participation in cross-PPIN centers' collaborative projects will also be considered in
this process. With this plan, the DC ensures that pilot projects address the needs and context of PP census
tracts and fall within the themes of C3P2 and within the larger goals of the PPIN. Potential pilot projects will
build on the current projects that examine the impact of changes in the Living Environment and the adaptation
of efficacious interventions to improve cancer outcomes in PP areas, and may investigate multi-level
interventions to address needs such as low food access and lack of transportation, as well as specific needs to
improve cancer survivors' health. The DC also support the C3P2 mission of expanding research capacity in
PP areas by providing research experience opportunities to CEC trainees and other investigators not affiliated
with the center, and requiring pilot projects have at least one early career investigator as PI or investigator. All
projects will be peer-reviewed to ensure scientific rigor and integrity. The DC will have at least two active
projects in each funded year. Lastly, the DC will support the development and implementation of the pilot
projects by coordinating the use of resources from the Research and Methods Core (RMC) and the
Administrative Core (AC), supporting investigators with IRB applications, training, identifying personnel as
needed, and evaluating progress. Thus, the DC is well poised to successfully support the C3P2 and contribute
to the goals of the PPIN."

This K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is a revision. The objectives of this
proposal focus on developing mentees at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and expanding the research
expertise of the candidate. Specifically, this award will ensure that the candidate protected time to commit to
ongoing and expanded mentoring efforts of mentees engaging in clinical research that focuses patient-oriented
research, and acquire new imaging expertise that applies quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
methods to patients who suffer from age-related neurodegenerative dementing disorders. This proposal will
allow the investigator to expand his research efforts into a new patient population, develop experience with
working in a programmatic research consortium, and advance clinical research efforts to addressing
neuroimaging biomarkers. The Career Development Plan focuses on training in high-field and ultra-high-
field MRI methods, where hands on training with expert collaborators and consultants will be supplemented
with coursework pertinent to the research objectives. Development in 3 tesla and 7 tesla methods will be
applied to a rare disease patient population with pure autonomic failure, who may convert to dementia with
Lewy Bodies, an Alzheimer Disease-related dementia. The Mentoring Plan is designed to focus on helping
mentees succeed in developing their academic research career. Specifically, the mentoring plan will ensure
that early stage neurologists who are applying for K-awards (i.e. K23, K01, and K76) will have appropriate
mentorship as they develop research methodologies, and build research expertise. Additional support from
consultants will allow the applicant to develop of a mentoring approach that is tailored to the physician-
scientist. There are extensive institutional resources at VUMC which will ensure completion of this goal. Finally,
the career development focus which develops new imaging techniques will be facilitated by the Research
Plan. This project will assess neurodegenerative changes that occur in patient with alpha-synuclein disorders.
These include the prodromal state of pure autonomic failure, as well as Parkinson’s disease, and Dementia
with Lewy bodies. The aim is to understand how changes to iron, neuromelanin, and macromolecular content
can be used as objective imaging biomarkers of age-related neurodegenerative diseases, advancing imaging
candidates that can quantitate severity and extent of these biologic changes. By acquiring data on patients
who are part of the Autonomic Rare Disease Consortium, the candidate can test the hypothesis that early
reductions in brainstem neuromelanin, elevated iron deposition, and elevated macromolecular content will
identify patients likely to convert from prodromal to central alpha-synuclein disorders. Integrating MRI data with
clinical observations from the detailed clinical investigations will allow improvements to prediction models of
disease conversion. Overall, this award will provide crucial support for to expand the expertise and mentoring
program of the applicant."
10849827,"Project Summary/Abstract
All cells must grow to a minimum size—the “critical size”—before they can commit to cell
division. This size requirement prevents cells from becoming too big or small, and co-ordinates
division with cell growth in mass. As a consequence of size control, cells have narrow and
characteristic distributions of cell size—that is, size homeostasis. Despite decades of study, it is
unknown how cells measure and respond to size, or why mechanistically a minimum size is
required for commitment to division. The first term of this grant showed that as yeast cells grow
in size, hundreds of mRNAs are systematically expressed at higher and higher levels—they
increase in abundance faster than the increase in cell size, and so they increase in concentration.
This is termed “super-scaling”. Other mRNAs do the opposite—they increase slower than the
increase in size, and decrease in concentration—termed “sub-scaling”. Strikingly, genes that
activate the cell cycle fall into the first group, while genes that inhibit the cell cycle fall into the
second group. This immediately suggests a “Scaling” model for cell size control and
homeostasis: the ratio of activators to inhibitors increases as G1 phase cells grow, and at a
sufficiently high concentration of activators, inhibitors are overcome, and cells commit to
division. The “sizer” that controls cell size is the mechanism that produces differential scaling of
gene expression. Here, key aspects of this idea will be tested. A system will be developed for
accurately measuring scaling of gene expression. A system will be developed for accurately
measuring the variation in cell size at commitment to division. Most importantly, these newly-
developed assays will be used to test several hypotheses for the mechanism by which genes are
differentially expressed with size. The generality of the “Scaling” model will be addressed.
Finally, the possibility that scaling is also occurring at the level of translation will be considered."
10832669,"Mitochondria play a central role in age-related pathologies, loss of resilience, and the decline in quality of life in
older adults. As we age changes in mitochondrial function lead to disruption of redox and energy homeostasis,
altered metabolite levels, impaired calcium regulation, and increased sensitivity to permeability transition, all of
which contribute to tissue dysfunction. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that continuously adapt to changing
cellular demands by altering protein assembly and interactions to modify their function. Despite the obvious
importance little is known about how age-related changes in mitochondrial protein interactions underlie changes
in function. To address this fundamental question we propose to apply a state of the art novel quantitative
chemical cross-linking with mass spectrometry approach (XL-MS) to quantify the changes in the mitochondrial
interactome in heart and skeletal muscles with age. By combining this innovative XL-MS approach with targeted
functional assays and interventions developed over the last several years to manipulate mitochondria in vivo and
in vitro we are uniquely positioned to identify the changes in mitochondrial protein interactions that underlie age-
related mitochondrial dysfunction. Our preliminary data indicate specific disruption of multiple protein interaction
networks involved in ADP transport, ATP synthesis, glutamate metabolism, and complexes of the electron
transport system with age. Many of these protein complexes that XL-MS indicates are disrupted in aging directly
interact with the mitochondrial targeted peptide SS-31 that we have shown reverses mitochondrial dysfunction
in heart and skeletal muscle. Our overall hypothesis is that changes in the mitochondrial interactome driven by
elevated mitochondrial redox stress underlie decreased ATP production and altered metabolite levels in
mitochondria from aged heart and skeletal muscle. In aim 1 we will apply XL-MS and site-specific assays to
measure the link between the interactome and function in mitochondria from aged mouse heart and skeletal
muscle. As a specific test of new mechanistic insights available from this approach we will use gene-edited iPSC
derived cardiomyocytes to test the causal relationship between altered interactions in the glutamate
dehydrogenase regulatory region, the largest change identified in the aged mitochondrial interactome, and
impaired glutamate and α-ketoglutarate metabolism. In aim 2 we will use mitochondrial targeted interventions to
reverse mitochondrial dysfunction, SS-31 and AAV-mitochondrial targeted catalase, and induce mitochondrial
redox stress to identify the most functionally important changes in the mitochondrial interactome from aim 1. In
aim 3 we use human muscle biopsies to test whether changes in the mitochondrial interactome identified in aims
1 and 2 translate into aged human skeletal muscle. We will separate older adults into low and high performing
groups to compare the mitochondrial interactomes and function with those of young adults. Results from these
experiments will have a transformative impact on the field by providing the first window into the links between
the mitochondrial protein interaction network and age-related mitochondrial dysfunction.

10863857,"Hypoxemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) arising from direct lung injury are associated
with a dysfunctional lung surfactant system; however, large clinical trials of surfactant replacement therapy have
been unsuccessful in this population. The method employed for surfactant delivery in these unsuccessful trials
was liquid bolus instillation, which often requires intubation, use of large liquid volumes (~500 ml) and subsequent
mechanical ventilation often late in the progression of ARDS. A successful dry powder aerosol synthetic lung
surfactant product would provide the advantages of early surfactant administration, potentially before the need
for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), rapid and high dose delivery to the alveolar region, and improved
efficacy compared with instillation based on preliminary animal model findings.
 The goal of this study is the preclinical development of a synthetic lung surfactant dry powder aerosol product
(including delivery strategies, formulations and devices) for administration to adults experiencing hypoxemia or
ARDS from direct lung injury in a rapid, efficient and safe manner while receiving different modes of ventilation
support. Aerosol delivery strategies and devices will be developed and optimized for high efficiency aerosol
administration during high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) therapy, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV)
and IMV. High efficiency aerosol administration will be enabled by a combination of a highly dispersible spray-
dried powder formulation, a new positive-pressure dry powder inhaler (DPI), and an excipient enhanced growth
(EEG) aerosol delivery strategy. Aerosolization performance and lung delivery efficiency will be established and
optimized using a concurrent approach of realistic in vitro experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
modeling. Animal experiments (in rats) will be implemented to determine appropriate levels of the surfactant
protein analog and assess in vivo efficacy of the lead synthetic surfactant dry powder formulation in different
models of direct lung injury. Specific aims of the project are as follows:
Specific Aim 1. Develop a synthetic surfactant dry powder aerosol formulation that can be easily dispersed into
a small particle aerosol with low air volume, exhibit hygroscopic growth, and enable stable product storage.
Specific Aim 2. Develop and optimize surfactant delivery strategies and devices that enable safe, efficient and
rapid aerosol administration to adults receiving HFNC, NPPV or IMV.
Specific Aim 3. Test the efficacy of the lead synthetic surfactant formulations administered with an animal-
version of the air-jet DPI using in vivo rat models of acute lung injury (ALI) mimicking bacterial infection, viral
infection, and ventilator-induced lung injury.
Outcomes and Impact. The proposed advances directly address multiple previous failure mechanisms related
to instilled and aerosolized (liquid and powder) surfactants and are necessary to make aerosolized surfactant
therapy for hypoxemia or ARDS with the option of early treatment a viable option in adults."
10873892,"Mitochondria play cornerstone role in cellular metabolism and mitochondrial
fragmentation, swelling and loss of cristae, epigenetic changes in mitochondrial DNA, reduction
of transport proteins, and mitochondria-ER regulation precede histopathological abnormalities in
DR. Recent studies demonstrate that mitochondrial transfer can rescue cells from bioenergetic
abnormalities and cell death [1-8]. We propose that normalization of retinal endothelial cell
bioenergetics by mitochondrial transfer can prevent retinal vascular degeneration and provide a
novel breakthrough approach to treatment of DR. Accumulating evidence suggests that retinal
vascular degeneration occurs when diabetic metabolic insult causes both retinal damage and
defective repair by bone marrow-derived circulating vascular reparative cells, called CD34+ cells
based on the critical surface marker that identifies them for isolation. In healthy subjects, CD34+
cells participate in the retinal vascular repair process by migrating and homing to the site of
endothelial injury, while this capability is lost in CD34+ cells from diabetic subjects with vascular
complications. Previously, we demonstrated that bone marrow pathology with CD34+ cell
dysfunction precedes and is necessary for retinal vascular degeneration in diabetes. CD34+ cells
repair by paracrine mechanism and was recently shown to include mitochondrial transfer
nanotunnels or through extracellular vesicles-mediated mechanism. Release of mitochondrial
DNA and proteins by damaged retinal endothelial cells stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis in
stem/progenitor cells followed by the transfer of mitochondria to the injured resident cells.
Alterations that impair the ability of diabetic CD34+ cells to repair injured vascular cells are not
completely understood and will be studied in this application. is one of the questions addressed
in this application. We hypothesize that retinal endothelial cells (REC) mitochondria are damaged
and mitochondria are not repaired because of deficiency in i) initiation of mitochondrial transfer
by CD34+ cells, ii) quality of CD34+cell mitochondria, and iii) the CD34+ cells sensing of resident
endothelial cell mtDNA/proteins released during injury. To test hypothesis, the following Specific
Aims will be addressed: Aim 1: To determine the signals and mechanisms that initiate repair of
damaged retinal endothelial cells by mitochondrial transfer. Aim 2: To examine the mitochondrial
transfer by CD34+ cells from diabetic and nondiabetic donors in db/db mice."
10808108,"SUMMARY
The composition of the blood proteome provides indications of normal health and the presence of disease.
Over 90% of non-albumin proteins in the blood of mammals are N-glycoproteins bearing N-glycan structures
produced in the Golgi apparatus prior to nascent glycoprotein secretion. We have previously discovered an
intrinsic mechanism controlling the half-lives and thereby abundance and function of circulating blood
glycoproteins. This mechanism is linked to the progressive glycosidic remodeling of nascent blood
glycoproteins by circulating exo-glycosidases thereby resulting in the exposure of cryptic endocytic lectin
receptor ligands. Endocytic lectin receptors are highly conserved among mammals and are expressed on the
surface of various vascular and organ cell types where they recognize and bind their ligands from among
circulating blood components and glycoproteins. We have found that this intrinsic mechanism of blood
glycoprotein remodeling and clearance by lectin receptors is targeted by pathogens and the resulting changes
in blood glycoprotein abundance are linked to disease onset. Lectin receptor ligands include glycosidic
linkages of galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose, or mannose; however, glycoproteins bearing physiological
lectin receptor ligands remain mostly unknown and thus the functions of lectin receptors are also mysterious.
This laboratory has developed an approach to identify physiological blood glycoprotein ligands of individual
lectin receptors by chromatography and mass spectrometry protocols. A subset of mammalian lectin receptors
bind to glycosidic linkages bearing exposed mannose, herein termed mannosylated blood glycoproteins. This
laboratory discovered in past related studies that the accumulation of mannosylated glycoproteins due to
defects in N-glycan synthesis causes chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, and degenerative disease. Normally
however, the recognition and clearance of mannosylated blood glycoproteins involves the expression and
function of mannose binding lectins including Mrc1. This proposal addresses the hypothesis that Mrc1 controls
the levels of mannosylated blood glycoproteins in normal physiology and protects against the onset of disease.
Our supporting data demonstrate that Mrc1 has a blood ligand repertoire including key regulators of the
vasculature. Absence of Mrc1 results in the accumulation of mannosylated Renin and Angiotensin Converting
Enzyme with elevated blood pressure. In addition, accumulating mannosylated Myeloperoxidase in the blood is
associated with vascular inflammation, blood-brain barrier breakdown, tissue damage, and autism-like
features. The roles of Mrc1 ligands will be addressed with inhibitors. In the blood of humans, we have further
discovered a link between individuals with low levels of mannosidase activity and high levels of mannosylated
blood proteins. This proposal in summary will investigate how the accumulation of mannosylated blood
glycoprotein ligands in Mrc1 deficiency cause disease and establish whether humans bearing high levels of
mannosylated blood glycoproteins similarly contain elevated markers of inflammation and vascular defects."
10935944,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neglect dyslexia (ND) is an acquired reading disorder associated with spatial neglect (SN), commonly
experienced by right hemisphere stroke survivors. ND causes whole-word omissions of left-sided words and
errors on the left-sided letters of individual words (unilateral paralexias). These two distinct error types can be
explained by dysfunctional egocentric (i.e., viewer-centered) and allocentric (i.e., object-centered) spatial
cognition, respectively. Gaze asymmetry has long been considered a hallmark symptom of SN, and recent
research suggests that it might contribute to these errors. However, no study to date has directly correlated gaze
and reading in this population. Gaze involves the coordination of the head and eyes to orient toward a target.
However, most gaze-related research in SN and ND thus far has required the head to be stabilized at midline.
Therefore, relative contributions of the head and eyes to the asymmetry of gaze in SN and ND is unknown.
Current neuroanatomical models of SN and ND suggest that it is caused by disruptions to the interaction of a
bilateral dorsal attention network, which subserves spatial attention and eye movements, and a unilateral right
hemisphere ventral attention network, which supports arousal, vigilance, detection of novel stimuli, and
reorienting attention to novel stimuli. It is unknown how a network disruption leads to a specific type of ND. In
this project, we will examine the predictive value of gaze on ND reading errors, the relative contributions of the
head and eyes to gaze orientation, and the disrupted neural networks that underlie specific gaze patterns and
egocentric and allocentric ND error patterns. (1) To characterize the association between gaze and reading, we
will conduct two experiments that measure gaze with a wearable eye tracker during single-word reading. We
expect to find a strong correlative relationship between gaze accuracy and reading accuracy in participants with
ND, which would support the potential for the use of gaze metrics for ND diagnosis and classification. (2) To
determine the relative contributions of the head and eyes to gaze deficits, we will conduct an experiment using
eye tracking-enabled immersive virtual reality to measure gaze while manipulating the effect of head rotation.
We expect participants with a greater contribution of the head to have poorer egocentric gaze toward left-sided
words and more whole-word omissions. (3) To identify the neural networks that underlie gaze asymmetry and
reading errors, we will lesion map brain scans of participants with and without ND, then use voxel-wise lesion-
symptom mapping to correlate the degree of lesioned brain areas to gaze accuracy and reading accuracy. We
anticipate that lesions disrupting the dorsal network impair egocentric gaze orientation and associate with whole-
word omissions, and that lesions disrupting the ventral network impair allocentric gaze orientation and associate
with unilateral paralexias."
10825587,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Somatic mosaic mutations accumulate over time in every healthy cell but detecting them requires specialized
sequencing technologies with extremely low error rates. However, all current technologies for profiling mosaic
mutations require amplification of DNA, which introduces single-strand DNA artifacts. Therefore, even the
highest fidelity technologies can only detect mosaic mutations when they are present in both strands of the
original DNA, but they cannot detect the single-strand mutations and damage from which they originate. Here,
we develop a technology that can directly sequence DNA molecules without any amplification at ultra-high
fidelity, such that mutations and damage present in only one of the two strands of a DNA molecule can be
detected for the first time. It achieves this by significantly increasing the accuracy of single-molecule DNA
sequencing, and furthermore, it utilizes long reads that can be used to study regions of the genome that are
not accessible to all prior high-fidelity mosaic mutation technologies that utilize short reads. Our technology,
called Hairpin Duplex Enhanced Fidelity Sequencing (HiDEF-seq), will be developed as part of the SMaHT
Network, and we will work in close coordination with the Network at all stages of the project to ensure it
contributes significantly to the Network’s goals of creating a comprehensive catalogue of somatic mosaicism in
human tissues. In the first UG3 phase of the project, we will develop our technology to cost-effectively and
reliably profile any bulk human tissue. In Aim 1 of UG3, we will develop the technology to profile all classes of
single- and double-strand mosaic mutations at ultra-high fidelity (substitutions, insertions, deletions, structural
variants, and retroelements). In Aim 2 of UG3, we will use machine-learning models of single-molecule
polymerase kinetics to detect diverse types of single-strand DNA damage and modifications. Importantly,
HiDEF-seq will achieve detection of all these events simultaneously in one assay. In the second UH3 phase of
the project, we will work closely and integrally with the SMaHT Network to validate and scale the throughput of
the technology so that it can profile the entire collection of SMaHT tissue samples. In Aim 1 of UH3, we will
fully automate the laboratory component of HiDEF-seq to enable creation of sequencing libraries for hundreds
of samples per day. In Aim 2 of UH3, we will scale the computational pipeline of our technology for rapid
analysis of thousands of samples. Throughout this project, we will work with the SMaHT Network to validate,
standardize, and disseminate the technology. HiDEF-seq’s achievement of ultra-high fidelity sequencing of
single-strand DNA mutations and damage will enable fundamentally new types of mosaic mutation studies that
will disentangle the interrelated processes of DNA mutation, repair and replication. It will also enable
systematic dissection of sources of artifacts stemming from laboratory processing of DNA. Furthermore, it will
reveal the instantaneous effects and temporal dynamics of exogenous mutagens, with broad implications for
environmental health and discovery of factors that reduce or increase the rate at which our genomes mutate."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces significant pathology, including post-injury inflammation (particularly
within the thalamus), that can lead to long-term morbidities. Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, are
critical mediators of neuroinflammation that can have either neurotoxic or neurotrophic effects. Progress has
been made investigating TBI-induced neuroimmune responses in rodents and therapies showing great
promise have moved to clinical trials but failed to translate into beneficial interventions for humans suffering
TBI. However, therapies targeting processes that occur in higher order mammals, with immune responses,
cytoarchitecture, and metabolic rates similar to humans, such as pigs, would be more likely to translate to the
clinic successfully. The neuroinflammatory progression following brain injury in pigs, however, is not well-
understood. Our preliminary data demonstrated that microglial processes converge onto injured axonal
swellings (microglial process convergence; MPC) in the thalamus of micro pigs, that is not recapitulated in rats,
following diffuse TBI but does appear to occur in humans. Studies in mice indicate that this microglial process
convergence (MPC) requires functional P2Y12R, however, the mechanisms behind MPC in higher order
mammals is currently unknown. Both our preliminary data and previous studies indicate that MPC may be an
ameliorative process, promoting axonal outgrowth acutely post-injury. Therefore, the goal of this study is to
assess the roles of microglial changes on pathological progression in a pig model of diffuse TBI.
Studies indicate that males have greater pro-inflammatory responses and less axonal outgrowth compared to
females. However, there are no known studies evaluating sex as a biological variable in MPC. Accordingly, the
current study will address the following specific aims 1) to evaluate the effects of inflammatory and
P2Y12R modulation on MPC, neuronal survival and axonal outgrowth/retraction following injury and 2)
to assess the prevalence of MPC in human brain tissue following diffuse TBI and other CNS
injuries/diseases. To address these aims we will complete quantitative 3D assessments of multiplexed
immunohistological samples for microglial-axonal interactions in vitro and in pigs to determine the degree of
MPC in relation to axonal outgrowth/retraction changes, P2Y12R expression, and sex-related variability. As the
prevalence of MPC following brain injury in the human population is currently unknown, we will also probe for
the degree of MPC onto injured axonal swellings, neuronal survival, axonal outgrowth/retraction, and spatially
resolved RNA profiles in a unique cohort of postmortem brain tissue. This study is significant because
understanding microglial-neuronal interactions and repair mechanisms in higher order species and humans of
both sexes will translate into therapeutics strategies for the treatment of TBI."

The courtship song of male zebra finches is a classical model for learning complex motor behaviors and shows
important parallels to human speech and communication. Male zebra finches learn a song from an adult tutor
and then reproduce this song throughout adulthood. The zebra finch model offers outstanding behavioral control
that permits the investigation of general principles of the circuit basis of vocal learning and motor control. Many
highly interconnected brain regions across the zebra finch brain, ranging from forebrain to brainstem motor
nuclei, form a song control system required for song learning and song production. A major bottleneck in
understanding this system stems from unknown connectivity properties in the songbird brain and little knowledge
of how these connectivity properties interface with transcriptomic and functional diversity of individual neurons
to produce robust behavioral output. BRAIN Initiative supported tools have revolutionized research in the
laboratory mouse by addressing this same bottleneck. However, these technologies are currently limited to a
small set of model systems and not yet adapted to the zebra finch. We recently developed a novel class of
flexible, high-throughput connectivity mapping tools for investigating neural circuit function. Our strategy relies
on nucleic acid barcodes to translate neuronal connectivity into a format that can be read out by DNA sequencing
and can bridge connectomics, transcriptomics, and functional data with single-cell resolution. Importantly, our
tools are virus-based and can therefore be applied across species. To enable a multi-modal investigation of
the circuit function of integrated cell types in the zebra finch song control system, and in particular the
song nucleus HVC, in this capacity-building proposal we will adapt our next-generation connectomics
and spatial transcriptomics tools to the zebra finch. In Aim 1, we bring the single-cell tracing method
MAPseq and its combination with single-cell RNA sequencing to the zebra finch to discover, in an unbiased way,
the multi-omic cell type identities in HVC. In Aim 2, we first optimize in situ sequencing method BARseq for zebra
finches to map endogenous gene expression and barcodes in space. We then establish a pipeline to routinely
register functional imaging data of HVC with BARseq images to interrogate the interaction of neuronal activity,
gene expression, and long-range connectivity at the resolution of single cells for hundreds of cells per
experiment. Successful completion of these aims paves the way for integrative TargetedBCP R01 projects
conducted in collaboration between the Kebschull and Long labs. These projects will update existing models of
song learning in the zebra finch by incorporating long-range connectivity and transcriptomic cell identity
information that is critical for achieving a mechanistic understanding of circuit function. Our first target will test
two competing hypotheses about how the connectomic and transcriptomic features of HVC neurons determine
network properties that give rise to acoustic structure in the songbird brain."

 This is a competitive renewal of NIH grant DK082659 entitled “Developmental Genes, miRNAs & Adipose
Tissue”. Obesity is epidemic throughout the population and is a major driving force in the pathogenesis of type
2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and many other disorders. Over the past decade, work supported by this grant
has shown that obesity depends not only on the balance between energy intake and utilization, but also on the
balance between energy storage in white adipose tissue (WAT) and energy expenditure in brown adipose
tissue (BAT). We have shown that both WAT and BAT are heterogeneous, in part due to intrinsic differences
between adipocytes in different depots and also through their dependence on insulin/IGF1/FoxO signaling. We
have demonstrated heterogeneity at the cellular level by clonal analysis of murine preadipocytes and by single
cell analysis of human preadipocytes. In important new studies, we have found that different adipose depots
differ in their expression of miRNAs and that there are alterations in miRNAs and miRNA processing in adipose
tissue in aging, obesity, and lipodystrophy. Furthermore, we have shown that adipose tissue is a major source
of circulating exosomal miRNAs; that these can regulate gene expression in other tissues, forming a novel
mode of adipose communication; and that this is, in part, regulated by sequence motifs within miRNAs which
govern their cellular retention vs. exosomal secretion. The specific aims for the next 5 years are:
 Aim 1: Define the interactions between adipocyte heterogeneity, insulin signaling and exosomal
miRNA mediated cellular communication. We will define the role of insulin in regulation of adipocyte miRNA
expression and exosomal secretion and determine differences between subtypes of WAT and BAT. We will
study the effects of BAT activation, obesity and weight loss In both mice and humans. We will determine if the
recently defined EXO and CELL motifs and RNA binding proteins involved in miRNA sorting play a role in
these processes, and explore the role of exosomal tRNA fragments, as a new class of regulatory small RNAs.
 Aim 2: Use UPRT labeling and hCD63 to directly track exosomal miRNAs and exosomes in vivo.
With these, we will determine the relative contributions of BAT and WAT to the pool of circulating exosomes
and exosomal miRNAs and how these change during cold exposure, feeding/fasting, and in obesity. We will
also explore the role of insulin in vivo using the euglycemic clamp and tissue specific InsR knockout mice.
 Aim 3: Enhance potential of miRNA therapeutics by manipulating exosomal sorting of miRNAs in
vivo. Taking advantage of our recent identification of motifs that modulate miRNAs cellular retention or
exosomal secretion, and using cholesterol/lipoprotein metabolism as a model, we will explore the role of
modifying miRNA or their sorting proteins for therapeutic purposes. Together with the studies above, this will
allow us to uncover how the exosomal miRNA communication system interacts with the endocrine system to
regulate metabolism, and how this may be used to treat disorders like metabolic syndrome and diabetes."
10830426,"Caloric restriction is the most conserved behavioral intervention that prolongs lifespan in model organisms.
Capturing benefits of caloric restriction, either through dietary prescription or by identifying causal pathways that
can be manipulated pharmacologically, holds promise to improve cardiometabolic health. Testing whether the
life-prolonging effect is translatable to humans is challenging; however, multiple studies, with various approaches
to caloric restriction, have demonstrated benefits to surrogate endpoints such as weight loss, lipids, and glucose
homeostasis. One important question is the degree to which benefits of caloric restriction are due to weight
loss—i.e. would we all benefit from caloric restriction or are the benefits most applicable to patients who are
overweight? Moreover, long-term compliance with a diet requiring daily adherence is challenging. Intermittent
fasting has emerged as an alternative that does not require daily adherence and early studies suggest metabolic
benefit. Our multi-disciplinary research group has focused on studying fasting because there is theoretical benefit
independent of weight loss. Through coupling of clinical phenotyping with multi-omics analyses, we have defined
metabolic responses as a function of fasting duration and in relationship to key physiological events, such as
weight loss and changes in bone metabolism, as catabolic effects on bone are a consistent negative result of
caloric restriction with weight loss. We have discovered a marked fasting shift in lipid composition— sustained
even after re-feeding—characterized by reduced low carbon-content, saturated triglycerides and increased high-
carbon content, unsaturated triglycerides; a triglyceride shift shown in epidemiologic studies to protect against
future cardiometabolic disease and frailty. Remarkably, the beneficial shift in triglyceride quality is already evident
in the first fasting day, before weight loss or negative changes in bone turnover markers. Therefore, our central
hypothesis is that fasting drives cardiometabolic benefits independent of weight loss and the benefits can be
captured without negative effects to bone if each fasting dose is limited to one day. We propose a mechanistic
clinical study, randomizing volunteers at high risk of diabetes, to one of 3 groups: 1) Control group, 2) Fasting
one day per week for 3 months, or 3) Fasting one day per week with a caloric prescription to maintain body
weight. In Aim 1 we will perform metabolomics to test whether intermittent fasting beneficially reprograms lipid
metabolism, whether that reprogramming predicts improved insulin sensitivity and whether these changes occur
independent of weight loss. Recognizing that the most important negative consequence of any approach to
caloric restriction is the catabolic effect on bone, in Aim 2 we will assess the effects on bone, including state of
the art analyses of bone microarchitecture. If successful, this study will provide proof-of-concept for a once
weekly fasting intervention to improve cardiometabolic health without compromising bone integrity. Moreover,
by merging a randomized-control study design with rigorous clinical phenotyping and metabolomics, this project
holds promise to identify novel metabolic mechanisms underpinning the benefits of fasting."

The goal of the Rodent Phenotyping Core (RPC) is to increase the utility of mice and rats as
model organisms for vision research at The University of Iowa. The availability of a centralized
core for phenotyping will allow investigators to focus their resources on the science and
discoveries underlying vision research, rather than on training each lab’s personnel to perform
phenotyping. Such core-based services will yield more consistent and reproducible
phenotyping measures and in turn maximize the power of NEI-funded investigators to make
new discoveries.
The RPC will have the capability to perform detailed phenotyping of the anterior segment (slit-
lamp examination and photography, SD-OCT, gonioscopy, fluorescein angiography, and
intraocular pressure recording) and the posterior segment (fundus examination/photography,
electroretinogram, pupil light reflex, behavioral measurements of vision, acute suppression of
activity by light, and testing of optokinetic response)."

Recent advances in sequencing technologies provide a wealth of genotype and expression
data. In combination with high-quality clinical phenotype data, these data can provide key
insights into ophthalmic disease. However, most labs do not have the capabilities required to
efficiently use large-scale genotype and phenotype data.
The Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Core (BBC) will enhance the research activities of the
NEI-funded investigators at The University of Iowa by providing access to computational
researchers experienced in state-of-the-art procedures for statistical analysis and
bioinformatics. BBC personnel will have access to multiple high-performance computing
platforms, including dedicated access to computing resources on Argon, The University of
Iowa’s high-performance computing cluster.
The availability of a centralized core offering experiment design and analytic services will allow
investigators to focus their resources on the science and discoveries underlying vision
research while still being able to gain full access to high-quality and standardized expertise in
highly-specialized analytic techniques and theory. Training of the vision research community is
a critical aspect of the BBC with an emphasis towards understanding the capabilities and
limitations of biomedical experiments that leverage our ever-improving technology. The BBC’s
core-based services will yield more reproducible and well-powered analyses and in turn
maximize the ability of NEI-funded investigators to make new discoveries."

According to the most recent National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS), nearly
28,000 units (280 mL) of red blood cells (RBCs) are administered daily to transfusion recipients
in the United States alone. On an annual basis, over 10 million units are provided to people in
need of circulating RBCs. While the NBCUS concluded that healthcare providers were very
efficient in their use of stored units of RBCs, there are still complications that exist following
transfusion. Furthermore, local shortages of blood products available to healthcare providers
sometimes occur. In this proposal, the investigative team proposes a relatively simple modification
to the solution in which the RBCs are stored that will overcome the aforementioned shortcomings.
Specifically, the current FDA-approved storage solutions all have glucose concentrations
between 45-111 mM; the average healthy human has blood glucose levels of 4-6 mM and we
believe these hyperglycemic conditions are damaging the RBC in storage. Therefore, we
hypothesize that storing the cells in normoglycemic conditions (4-6 mM) and maintaining that
concentration with periodic feeding using a manual, proof-of-concept IV piggyback (IVPB), a
technique already used to drip reagents into a saline bag in hospitals, will lead to an improved
blood storage product. We will also test a novel rejuvenating solution based on C-peptide, the
31-amino acid peptide secreted from the pancreas in a 1:1 ratio with insulin. Preliminary data
shows our C-peptide-based rejuvenating additive can maintain important cell membrane and
metabolic properties for weeks into storage. We will test our solutions in a polyjet-printed
microfluidic device that mimics transfusion on a chip, while simultaneously monitoring key
secretion molecules that are determinants of blood flow and adhesion in vivo. Informed by our
early aims, we will test our normoglycemic storage solutions and rejuvenating strategy using
fluorescence-labeled RBCs in a mouse model of transfusion and radiolabeled RBCs in a larger,
sheep model of transfusion. Outcomes from these studies will be (1) an improved stored RBC
product that results in less post-transfusion complications for the recipient and (2) a product that
can be stored at least 2 weeks longer (56 days) than the current storage expiration time of 42
days. This extension of shelf-life would result in approximately 12,000 more units of available
stored blood over a 14 day period. Importantly, our method will not disrupt any aspect of current
blood collection and processing strategies, only requiring subsequent approval of less glucose in
the original collection and storage solutions, thus not disrupting current supply chain strategies."
10885032,"Project Summary
 Social support and social integration are some of the most robust predictors of morbidity and mortality
identified to date. This relationship arises from increased susceptibility to several of the top causes of death in
the United States, including major diseases of aging such as heart disease and cancer. Recent studies
suggest that a signature of social relationships is also detectable in data on gene regulation, highlighting a
potential pathway through which social ties get “under the skin” to influence health. However, despite abundant
evidence that the health effects of social relationships begin early in life, no studies have related the full life
course trajectory of social relationships to data on gene regulation, or used these data to investigate why some
individuals appear more susceptible to social isolation than others.
 The goal of this study is to address these gaps by linking fine-grained, longitudinal data on social
relationships to unbiased surveys of the molecular signature of social experience. To do so, we will leverage
an established model for social relationships and health in natural animal populations, the baboons of the
Amboseli ecosystem of Kenya. This population has been the subject of longitudinal study for up to 9
generations, revealing that social isolation predicts shortened lifespan in a manner highly analogous to
humans. We propose to link annual measures of social relationships, from birth through adulthood, with gene
expression and chromatin accessibility data collected both at baseline and following ex vivo challenge with
bacterial and viral mimics. This strategy will allow us to investigate the types of social relationships that matter
most, the timing of their effects on gene regulation, and their relevance for immune function, a primary
contributor to variation in health during aging.
 Using these data, we will address three aims. First, we will characterize the gene regulatory signature of
variation in social relationships across the life course. We will investigate the relative roles of early life,
cumulative experience, and social relationships close to the time of biological sample collection, as well as the
relative importance of social relationship quantity versus quality. Second, we will assess whether individuals
vary in their sensitivity to social environments based on genotype, by identifying gene-social relationship
interactions that affect gene expression. Finally, we will test the consequences of social relationship-associated
gene regulation for immune defense and lifespan. In doing so, this work will shed important light on whether
gene regulatory signatures of social relationships are likely to be mechanistically implicated in the link between
social relationships and health, or instead serve as passive biomarkers. Together, our results will provide the
most comprehensive window into the functional genomic signature of social relationships available to date. By
revealing when, how, and for whom social relationships matter most, they will therefore address three
questions of outstanding importance to understanding the role of the social environment in human health."

Markers of functional decline begin years before clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD). It is essential to capture these functional changes as early as possible to intervene before
symptoms arise to prevent further deterioration and loss of independence. Resources to assess cognitive
changes and detect the progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and ADRD are limited among older
adults with health disparities. The digital technology-based assessment of cognitively complex activities, such
as life-space mobility (LSM), has the potential to identify those at risk for cognitive decline. The proposed
longitudinal, case-control study aims to develop sensitive, practical, and ecologically acceptable LSM digital
markers that could be clinically relevant markers of subsequent cognitive decline among older adults, including
those with health disparities. Additionally, we will examine the moderating role of social health factors (e.g.,
social isolation, loneliness) in the relationship between sensor-based LSM features and cognitive function. We
will create a Real-Life Activity and Life-Space Mobility Monitoring Solution (RAMS), consisting of a GPS data
logger and wrist-worn actigraphy to assess real-life mobility performance objectively. The RAMS measures will
include spatial and temporal mobility measures (e.g., movement size, outdoor time) and physical activity
measures (e.g., sedentary time, activity fragmentation). We propose to recruit individuals aged ≥ 65 from a
racially and socioeconomically diverse group. Participants will be classified as cognitively normal (CN; n=157)
or MCI (n=157) based on a neuropsychological battery at baseline and will be prospectively followed up for 3
years to collect 7-day RAMS data and neuropsychological evaluations every 6 months. The specific aims are
to (1) Compare baseline and longitudinal trajectories of RAMS measures between CN and MCI groups and
determine the impact of social health factors on RAMS indicators and cognitive function; (2) Determine RAMS
indicators that classify CN and MCI groups at baseline and evaluate the ability of RAMS indicators to predict
the subsequent onset of MCI and dementia over a 3-year period; and (3) Evaluate older adults’ attitudes
towards and willingness to use digital health technology for monitoring risks of cognitive decline using a mixed-
methods approach. The public health impact of this study will provide unique insights into clinically meaningful
digital measures and modifiable risk factors to support the need for early treatment and prevention of
progression into MCI and dementia in older adults, including low-income ethnic minority older adults.
Understanding digital health monitoring acceptance will inform the translation of RAMS markers as a clinically
relevant tool for early detection of cognitive decline. Results will support our long-term goal to implement
RAMS as a platform for real-time monitoring to reduce functional and cognitive decline and maintain
independent functional living in an aging population."

Latinx sexual minorities, who are living at the intersection of two NIH identified health disparities groups, are at
increased risk for binge drinking behavior and alcohol-related problems which has been linked to the
intersectional forms of discrimination they experience – racism and heterosexism. Currently there are no
alcohol misuse behavioral health interventions that address the unique need and intersection of identities for
Latinx sexual minorities. There is one promising intervention, Culturally Adapted Motivational Interviewing
(CAMI), that has shown efficacy in decreasing alcohol misuse within Latinx individuals. Specifically, CAMI is a
tailored intervention for Latinx individuals which targets acculturative stress and has shown strong promise in
its reduction of alcohol misuse. Yet, CAMI only address singular forms of discrimination and does not use an
intersectionality and LGBTQ affirming perspective to address multiple forms of discrimination. Therefore, CAMI
will be adapted using an LGBTQ affirmative model of intervention adaptation, informed by minority stress, to
develop an intervention that addresses intersectional forms of discrimination to target alcohol misuse among
Latinx sexual minorities called- Latinx Queer Adapted Motivational Interviewing (LaQAMI). LaQAMI will be
delivered via telehealth, it will be available in English and in Spanish, and traditional motivational interviewing
will be used as the controlled condition. The study will be conducted in New England (NE) and in the
Southwest (SW in Arizona) to account for geographical differences given the diversity of Latinx sexual
minorities. The study will be conducted in three phases: in-depth qualitative interviews with Latinx sexual
minorities (n=20) and clinic stakeholders from NE and the SW (n=10; aim 1) to capture intersectional forms of
discrimination and links to alcohol misuse and receive feedback on the adaptation of the manual; the second
phase will be open series where it will focus on examining feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and it
will be tested with 16 Latinx sexual minorities (n= 8 from NE; n= 8 from SW) and feedback will be incorporated
into the treatment protocol (aim 2); the third phase will be a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 60
Latinx sexual minorities with 30 participants from NE and 30 participants from the SW (15 receiving the new
intervention and 15 receiving MI from each region; aim 3). The goals of the current study are consistent with
NIAAA’s identified special populations and strategic plan. Additionally, the current K23 will build on the
applicant’s expertise in health disparities, minority stress, and quantitative skills and it will provide the applicant
with advanced training in cultural adaptation, community-engaged research, conceptualizing and executing
RCT’s, and qualitative and mixed methods research. The K23 training period will provide the applicant with the
needed protected time and training to become a leading health disparities researcher focusing on diversity and
addiction science."

 The overarching objective of this proposal is to determine if transfemoral osseointegrated prostheses have
a positive influence on the etiology of hip osteoarthritis (OA). The two leading causes of disability following
transfemoral amputation are chronic skin pathologies due to poor socket fit (e.g., ulceration) and OA due to
habitually altered joint loading. Osseointegrated prostheses are a recent clinical intervention to treat socket
related pathologies by directly mounting the prosthesis to the residual limb through a bone anchored implant,
providing a more normative load transmission from the ground to residual limb. This proposal will determine if
this improved load transmission has positive role on the pathogenesis of hip OA differently than socket
prostheses. This will be accomplished through a longitudinal study design that will compare the most common
biomechanical etiological factors to OA progression at two timepoints (baseline and 12-months) between two
groups (patients with osseointegrated prostheses and patients who successfully use a traditional socket
prosthesis). In Aim 1, we will quantify bilateral hip muscle quality using fat fraction quantitative magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Using these images, we will quantify 3D muscle volume and levels of fatty infiltration
on the bilateral hip musculature. This will elucidate if the known atrophy and poor composition due to disuse in
a socket prosthesis, both of which are known to progress OA, can be reversed following prosthesis
osseointegration. In Aim 2, we will quantify dynamic cartilage loading mechanics using motion capture and a
subject-specific musculoskeletal contact model. Because altered cartilage loading is a primary instigator and
factor in OA onset and progression, these results will determine if cartilage mechanics are normalized during
activities of daily living following osseointegration. Although muscle composition and cartilage mechanics are
etiological factors to OA development, we seek to assess the role of osseointegration on the clinical progression
of OA. Thus, in Aim 3, we will quantify cartilage health using T2 quantitative MRI, which is currently the most
sensitive methodology to assess early osteoarthritic changes in-vivo. Ultimately, we seek to use our multi-domain
approach to better inform targeted interventions aimed at improving outcomes following osseointegration.
 The candidate’s overarching career goal is to utilize engineering-based tools to better elucidate the
mechanisms to secondary pain conditions that can be used to improve targeted interventions. This proposal
builds on the candidate’s current expertise by providing new training in quantitative MRI, advanced imaging post-
processing tools, longitudinal research design and implementation, and links between biomechanics and clinical
factors of joint disease. The mentoring team consists of physical therapists, radiologists, bioengineers, and
orthopaedic surgeons who are experts in imaging, clinical interventions, and OA. This proposal will provide
preliminary data for an R01 focused on key factors that affect long-term outcomes with varying prosthesis types."
10762470,"Using wastewater surveillance data to study SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and predict COVID-19 outcomes
Due to the continued evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and emergence of new variants, COVID-19 will likely continue
to impose a substantial public health burden in the United States in the future. Yet, the rollback of clinical
testing programs and increased use of at-home tests nationwide will exacerbate under-detection of SARS-
CoV-2 infections, hindering timely public health situation awareness and intervention. Thus, development of
modeling tools to tackle this surveillance challenge is urgently needed and the goal of this application. We
propose to use wastewater surveillance data to study SARS-CoV-2 dynamics and predict COVID-19 cases,
hospitalizations, and deaths 1 to 6 weeks in the future. The proposed core model-inference/prediction system
will combine mechanistic models depicting SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the general population and the
ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) to incorporate SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance data for
inference. We will pilot-test this system using both rich data (wastewater surveillance and multiple COVID-19
outcomes) and detailed model estimates (e.g., infection prevalence) available for New York City (Aim 1). We
will then expand and test the system on 50+ counties across the United States (Aim 2). Using these models,
we will further create an easy-to-use modeling tool for public health officials (Aim 3). The proposed work is
Innovative and Robust in that 1) SARS-CoV-2 concentration in wastewater represents a composite measure
of SARS-CoV-2 presence in the population, regardless of individual testing behavior; 2) We will build prediction
systems that go beyond the situation awareness afforded by wastewater surveillance alone. We will design the
model-prediction system to be 3) flexible using modularized model components to accommodate diverse data
availability across locations and 4) robust by leveraging detailed data and estimates for New York City and 50+
counties to test and improve various model forms and quantify the uncertainty and accuracy of each model.
Further, the Investigator Team has synthesized expertise in wastewater surveillance and modeling, and will
work closely with public health officials to tailor the modeling system to public health need. With SARS-CoV-2
wastewater surveillance widely adopted in many communities (currently representing 100+ million Americans),
the model-prediction system developed here can support more proactive COVID-19 planning in the future."

Our long-term goal is to establish levels of vitamin D intake and vitamin D sufficiency for humans and canines
living in the circumpolar north. Our overall objectives are to (i) define how chronological age impacts vitamin D
status and morphological changes in the sled dog model, and (ii) determine the effects of salmon on vitamin D
status and markers of metabolic syndrome and insulin signaling in old and young sled dogs. With their shorter
lifespan and parallel biochemical pathways, dogs have become an important biomedical research model for
both dementia related impairments and insulin signaling. Sled dogs, in particular, are an important human
health model in the circumpolar north because they are part of the traditional subsistence lifestyle. Over the
past 100 years, societies in North America and elsewhere in the world have transitioned towards the so-called
“Western diet,” composed primarily of highly processed “factory foods”. This nutritional transition has been
identified as playing a central role in current public health issues in peoples of the far north. Historically, Alaska
Natives (AN) were able to consume adequate vitamin D from traditional foods, most notably from salmon,
despite living at latitudes that prevent the synthesis of vitamin D in the skin from sunlight for much of the year.
This is also true for village sled dogs. With the shift away from traditional foods, peoples of the circumpolar
north are experiencing increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Yup’ik children are developing rickets at
higher rates while elders consistently exhibit higher serum vitamin D levels; this is a stark contrast to national
trends. It is estimated that over 1 billion people worldwide are deficient in vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has
been implicated in a multitude of diseases, including metabolic disorders, aging, and cognitive impairments.
Still, little consensus has been reached on recommended intake to achieve adequate levels in humans and
even less so in dogs. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop better understanding of vitamin D intake in
the circumpolar north, where there is the highest risk of deficiency, to understand the links between diet, age,
vitamin D status, and metabolic health. This study will begin to fill the gaps in knowledge pertaining to vitamin
D deficiency with the following specific aims: 1) Correlate markers of brain aging with vitamin D status in
an animal model of the circumpolar north and 2) Determine the effects of increased vitamin D from wild
Alaska salmon on biomarkers of insulin signaling and metabolic health. Volume and morphology
changes in brain gray and white matter will be assessed with magnetic resonance imaging in old and young
dogs and correlated with serum vitamin D status. In addition to other markers of metabolic syndrome, the
insulin responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be measured in
response to insulin in sled dogs of varying ages before and after a dietary supplementation with wild Alaskan
Salmon. The expected outcomes of this project will lend to the insufficient data pertaining to vitamin D
requirements, status, and health outcomes in populations that rely solely on dietary intake to obtain sufficiency."

Faculty who reside in an interactive, multi-departmental research environment with extensive resources. Each
trainee has a primary mentor and one/two secondary mentors with complementary expertise to ensure distinct
and valuable perspectives that enhances the overall cancer-relatedresearch training experience. The objectives
of the ITOS Programremain unchanged, seeking to provideproactive mentoring, oversight and research training
in cutting-edge methodology; to develop useful academic and essential career development skills; to foster
collaborative, interdisciplinary interactions with faculty and other trainees; and, to provide exposure to current
cancer research discoveries and how these are being translated into novel approaches to prevent, diagnosis,
and treat cancer. The ITOS Program has seven essential programmatic components: 1) 33 member Program
Faculty who share common cancer research interests and provide essential mentoring for trainees; 2) one to
two year experiences in designated Program Faculty laboratories; 3) an ITOS Program Research Club providing
an engaging community forum for the trainees and Program Faculty to discuss work in progress as well as the
latest discoveries; 4) shared research resource workshops and tailored training in cutting-edge biotechnologies;
5) interdisciplinary engagement with trainees in HCC-sponsored thematic research retreats, symposia, work in
progress meetings, and seminars; 6) career development workshops and courses that equip trainees for
independent success; and, 7) opportunities to network nationally at a minimum of two professional conferences
each year. In its fourth year, the ITOS Program has graduated 9 fellows; 1MD, 1MD/PhD, 7 PhDs. Trainees from
diverse backgrounds, 58% female and 30.8% underrepresented racial/ethnic minorities, whom have all
successfully transitioned to positions in academia or industry. Based on the capabilities, capacity, trajectory of
MUSC for cancer-related training, and the successful accomplishments achieved during its initial funding period,
the ITOS Program is requesting the support for seven postdoctoral trainees each year, representing an increase
of two trainee positions. In summary, our ITOS Program offers distinct experiences and opportunities only
afforded to the selected ITOS Fellows, and the program, led by an outstanding cadre of Program Faculty, is
anticipated to remain highly attractive to emerging junior investigators locally and nationally."

Neural circuit formation requires a series of highly diverse and specific cell-cell recognition steps, many mediated by cell
adhesion molecules (CAMs). Indeed, mutations that disrupt CAMs or their regulation are associated with circuit level
neurodevelopmental disorders from dyslexia to schizophrenia. Our model is the mouse retina, an extension of the
central nervous system where ~100 types of neurons organize into dedicated circuits that encode the features of the
visual world. We focus here on the gamma-protocadherins (γ-Pcdhs), 22 CAMs expressed from a single gene cluster that
generate many thousands of distinct homophilic recognition complexes. The γ-Pcdhs are critical regulators of neuronal
self-avoidance in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), and cell survival and in many other types of neurons in the retina. The
mechanisms through which the γ-Pcdhs serve these functions are unknown, as is the importance of γ-Pcdh isoform
diversity. We used a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to generate an unbiased allelic series of mouse mutants with between 1 and
21 intact γ-Pcdh isoforms. From these, we learned that one isoform, γC4, is essential for neuronal survival, suggesting
that this isoform functions differently from the other 21. We propose to define the mechanisms of self-avoidance and
neuronal survival, and to use our allelic series to determine the level of isoform diversity required for normal neural
circuit formation. Our central hypotheses are that: 1) a high level of γ-Pcdh isoform diversity enables neurons to
distinguish between “self” and “non-self” to mediate self-avoidance while permitting interaction with neighboring
neurons through mechanisms common to all isoforms; and 2) neuronal survival, in contrast, requires interactions
specific to the γC4 isoform. In Specific Aim 1, we will use a strategic subset of our reduced-diversity mutants to
determine the extent of isoform diversity required for self/non-self discrimination in SACs, neurons essential for the
motion detection circuit in the retina. We will analyze this circuit at two levels: A) morphology of contacts between
SACs, and B) the electrophysiological function of direction-selective retinal ganglion cells, the downstream neurons in
the circuit. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the molecular mechanisms of self-avoidance using in vivo gene delivery to
manipulate candidate pathways and map essential domains. In Specific Aim 3 we will uncover the mechanisms through
which γC4 promotes neuronal survival. We will use retinal electroporation to map critical protein domains,
complemented by a discovery-based proteomics approach to find isoform-specific protein interactions for γC4. These
studies will allow us to better understand how the γ-Pcdhs contribute to cell-cell recognition and neural circuit
formation in the retina and provide insight into processes disrupted by neurodevelopmental disorders."

We will develop a data-driven model of seasonal and pandemic influenza transmission throughout the US to
accelerate robust assessments of multifaceted influenza intervention strategies. We will work closely with the
CDC Modeling Network to advance the fidelity, transparency and translation of models as an evidence base for
influenza policy making, prevention and control. This project extends a metapopulation model of influenza
transmission within and between 217 major metropolitan areas in the US that we are developing in
collaboration with the CDC Modeling Network. The model includes travel between cities, age- and risk-group
specific susceptibility, probability of clinical outcomes, intervention efficacies and uptake rates, as well as the
impacts of local climate and school calendars on transmission rates. Using a range of public health,
epidemiological, societal and economic metrics, the model can flexibly evaluate thousands of candidate
intervention strategies, including time- and location-based combinations of vaccines, antivirals, and social
distancing measures with potential subgroup-specific prioritization.
Our proposal includes four major aims. In Aim 1, we will extend our US Influenza Model to include the co-
circulation of multiple viruses competing via transient heterosubtypic immunity. We will derive new estimates
for the duration and magnitude of heterosubtypic immunity and design strain-specific strategies for effectively
controlling co-circulating seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses. In Aim 2, we will evaluate intervention
strategies that leverage newly approved and combined antiviral drugs. We will fit within-host viral dynamic
models to clinical data on new antivirals to estimate the efficacy of various drug regimens in different
subpopulations with respect to disease severity, infectiousness, and the risk of antiviral resistance. In Aim 3,
we will build a granular within-city model of influenza transmission based on abundant data and local
collaborations with public health and healthcare leaders in the Austin-Round Rock Metropolitan Area. We will
apply the model to elucidate socioeconomic and geographic disparities in influenza risk and design
interventions that ameliorate such gaps. In Aim 4, we will build an interactive visualization platform that allows
users to specify epidemic scenarios, implement layered interventions as simulations unfold, and view the
model dynamics through the lens of a surveillance module based on the CDC’s FluView Interactive portal.
We will work extensively with the CDC Modeling Network to build a diverse portfolio of validated models and
best practices for collaborative decision support. Our projects will contribute flexible models for the evaluation
of multifaceted influenza interventions, elucidate competition among influenza viruses and the efficacies of
novel antivirals, and provide insights into socioeconomic disparities in influenza burden. Furthermore, our
innovative visualization tool will broadly support the translation of science to public policy."
10765700,"Abstract: Parasitic nematode (PN) infections remain a major threat to human health globally. More than 1.5
billion people are infected with PNs, with children, pregnant women, and the elderly especially susceptible to
morbidity from nematode infection. Control strategies are restricted to periodic de-worming of infected
individuals, which is limited by rapid re-infection rates and the inevitable development of drug resistant worm
populations. There are currently no vaccines available for human PN infections. Therefore, there is a clear and
pressing need for new drugs to treat PN infections to forestall the emergence of resistant isolates. Of the PNs
infecting humans, hookworms are arguably the most important due to their voracious blood feeding activities.
The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that hookworm currently infects 576-740 million
people worldwide. Infection may cause anemia and protein deficiency, causing gastrointestinal health
problems generally and retarded growth and cognitive development in children. The bitter melon Momordica
charantia is widely grown in areas where hookworm is endemic, and has been used as a traditional medicine
for parasitic infections and other disease in developing countries. Aqueous extracts of M. charantia (MCE)
have been shown to inhibit feeding of infective hookworm larvae (L3) and to kill adult and L4 hookworm in
vitro, as well as several other nematodes. Chemical identification and characterization of the biologically active
component(s) may lead to development of a drug to treat hookworm and other PN infections. Here we propose
to isolate the active anthelmintic compound(s) from M. charantia using mortality of the hookworm
Ancylostoma ceylanicum to screen fractions. In Aim 1, we will use natural product chemistry to separate the
active component(s) from the rest of the plant material and a bioassay to identify the active anthelmintic
compund(s) within MCE. In Aim 2, we will determine if the isolated anthelmintic can successfully treat
hookworm infections in vivo. Identifying the active components of MCE that are responsible for the plant’s
remarkable anthelmintic activity and confirming its in vivo activity may lead to the development of a new
anthelmintic for the treatment of hookworm and other PNs."

Cilia are essential organelles, with functions ranging from cell-cell signaling to the generation of homeostatic
fluid flow in tubular organs. Consequently, an array of human congenital diseases has been characterized as
“ciliopathies,” because they share an etiology of defective cilia structure or function. Despite clear roles in the
development of the central nervous system, limbs, axial skeleton, kidneys, airway, brain, and reproductive
tracts, our understanding of the mechanisms that govern ciliogenesis and cilia-mediated developmental
patterning remain incomplete, not least because hundreds of different proteins are required for proper cilia
biogenesis and function, acting via an extensive interaction network containing diverse proteins of unknown
function. We propose here to study several large multi-protein assemblies that are essential for proper cilia
formation in order to determine the roles of these complexes in key steps in ciliogenesis, including recruitment
of proteins to the basal body, intraflagellar transport and recruitment of specific intraflagellar cargoes. This
grant combines directed mechanistic experiments, proteomics, 3D modeling, in vivo cell biology, and testing of
human disease alleles in model organisms to understand mechanisms by which key ciliary proteins and their
interaction partners effect proper cilia formation, and how specific mutations in these genes lead to birth
defects. By focusing on proteins with demonstrated importance in development and disease, but for which no
mechanism of action is yet known, experiments proposed here will provide important new breadth and depth to
our understanding cilia-mediated developmental patterning and novel cell processes in ciliary biology. In turn,
these findings should provide greater insight to a range of congenital diseases ranging from the relatively mild
Oral-Facial-Digital syndrome to the wholly lethal Short Rib Polydactyly."

This renewal application seeks continued support for the T-32, Interdisciplinary Training in Rheumatic
Diseases at Vanderbilt University. The program seeks support for 2 predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral positions.
The goal of the program is to provide the next generation of investigators with the tools necessary to make
critical discoveries and to advance our understanding and treatment of complex rheumatic disorders. Our
faculty have created an interactive environment of discovery that bridges both clinical and basic research for
pre and post-doctoral trainees. An interdisciplinary approach is coupled with a carefully orchestrated mentoring
process so that trainees are provided with a broad perspective and they are exposed to opportunities for
clinical translation of problems that cannot be solved by a single laboratory. The preceptors in the program are
highly interactive and maintain extensive collaborative efforts between and among the research groups. These
interactions create four Interest Groups within the program: Innate and Adaptive Immunity; Vascular Biology
and Inflammation; Precision Medicine; and Musculoskeletal Biology. The program is organized to meet the
career goals of individuals who want to apply advanced technologies, such as genomics or proteomics to
rheumatic disease as well as to support the careers of individuals who want to translate these advances to
improve health care. In addition to Departmental and preceptor-specific laboratory instruction, each trainee
receives rheumatic disease research training through an interdisciplinary curriculum. Combined research
forums, journal clubs and shared core facilities promote interactions beyond individual laboratories or divisions.
Trainees in the program are actively mentored by both faculty members and through “peer mentoring” by
former students and senior fellows in the program. Degree granting pathways for MSCI and MPH will be
available to the program. Significant institutional investment in the Division's facilities and the recruitment of
outstanding new faculty further strengthen the program for the future."
10764955,"Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax disease, has remained as a top bioterrorism concern since the
2001 anthrax attack. B. anthracis causes anthrax through a combination of bacterial infection and toxemia. As a
major virulence factor, the anthrax lethal toxin (LT) plays an essential role during multiple steps of the disease.
Due to the rapid course of anthrax disease, in particular, the early non-specific, flu-like symptoms of inhalational
anthrax, patients usually seek medical assistance when the disease is already in the middle/late stages, making
the clinical management of anthrax patients an extremely challenging task. Current treatments include antibiotics
and anti-toxin antibodies that respectively eliminate the pathogen and neutralize the toxin. However, there is no
therapy available to deal with the cellular/tissue damage caused by LT already having reached its molecular
targets inside cells. Mortality usually follows when the host fails to repair this damage, the so called “point-of-no-
return” for current therapy. Thus, even with intensive medical care, the mortality rate of systemic anthrax is high,
reaching > 50%. Therefore, there is an urgent unmet clinical need to develop better targeted therapies to avert
anthrax-induced mortality. Our goal in this application is to discover the molecular mechanisms underlying LT-
induced lethality and to develop potential targeted therapeutics to treat patients beyond the “point-of-no-return”.
Here, we set out to determine the specific roles of disrupting each of the ERK, p38, and JNK pathways in anthrax-
induced lethality, discover the underlying molecular mechanisms, and develop the concept of reactivation
/mobilization of these pathways as a targeted therapy for anthrax-induced mortality. In Aim 1, we will determine
the role of specifically disrupting the ERK pathway in anthrax-induced lethality. Among the three core MAPK
pathways targeted by LT, the ERK pathway is fundamental to many biological processes, including cell
proliferation and survival. Thus, we hypothesize that disrupting the ERK pathway is the major cause of anthrax-
induced lethality. We will generate and use novel mouse models containing MEK alleles that are resistant to LT-
cleavage to understand the precise role of ERK pathway inactivation in anthrax pathogenesis. In Aim 2, we will
further determine the roles of disrupting the p38 and JNK pathways, the two major stress-activated pathways
that hosts activate in order to adapt to a myriad of unfavorable conditions, in anthrax pathogenesis. Based on
our strong preliminary data that the LT-disrupted MAPK pathways, in particular the ERK pathway, can be
reactivated by the addition of potent mitogens, in Aim 3, we will explore the ERK pathway reactivation as a
targeted therapy for anthrax-induced tissue damage.
Upon completion of these studies, it is our expectation that we will provide significant conceptual advances in
our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of anthrax pathogenesis, and offer an evidence-
based framework for developing anthrax-targeted therapies, which will complement the current therapies with
antibiotics and anti-toxin antibodies, to prevent anthrax mortality, even at advanced stages of anthrax infection."
10867429,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of patients with leukemia, yet
robust responses to this modality in solid tumors have been lacking. As a result, most patients with relapsed or
refractory solid tumors remain in dire need of alternative therapy. Given the inhospitable solid tumor
microenvironment, we are unlikely to achieve robust responses without the most highly potent CAR T cells. My
previous studies have demonstrated that CAR T cell potency can be enhanced by increasing the affinity of CAR
for its cognate antigen. Further investigation revealed that in particular cytotoxicity was enhanced, whereas T
cell survival and central memory (Tcm) differentiation (both important in CAR T clinical persistence and efficacy)
were actually impaired in the high affinity CAR T cells. The inverse influence of antigen binding affinity on
cytotoxicity and persistence raises questions as to the cellular signaling events underlying these discordant
effects. The findings also highlight the possibility that by reversing these decrements in survival and memory in
the high affinity cells, CAR T cell potency could be unleashed even further. The central hypothesis to be tested
here is that increased CAR affinity results in faster and more sustained activation of downstream T cell signaling
pathways, enhancing cytotoxic granule release yet overly engaging signaling molecules such as ERK and Akt,
tipping the cellular balance away from survival and memory differentiation and toward cell death. To test the
hypothesis, first I will use selected panels of affinity variants to evaluate the relationship between CAR affinity
and the activation kinetics of key signaling pathways by quantitative Western blot and phospho-protein flow
cytometry. Then using the same panels of affinity variants, I will evaluate the impact of CAR affinity on both
cytotoxic granule release using microscopy as well as T cell survival and memory differentiation in vitro using
flow cytometry. Lastly, I will identify and evaluate targetable mediators of the survival balance operating in high
affinity CAR T cells in vitro and in vivo. To do so, I will compare the affinity variant CAR T cells’ survival and Tcm
differentiation in vitro and in vivo in the presence or absence of specific inhibitors of pathways (MEK, Akt, and
Fas) that when over-activated can impair T cell survival or memory differentiation. These studies are expected
to yield highly potent CAR T cells equipped to address the challenge of solid tumors where both efficient killing
and robust persistence are necessary for efficacy. The training plan developed for this proposal is designed to
provide me with skills such as advanced microscopy techniques that are necessary to best address the questions
raised. Also incorporated into the training plan is mentorship from experts in the CAR field, an advisory
committee with special expertise in lymphocyte signaling and imaging, formal didactic experiences in career
development, and an overall training environment that will help me to develop into an independent physician-
scientist."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that lead to the destruction of insulin producing β cells
over a period of years before clinical presentation and afterwards. However, not all β cells are killed since follow-
up studies of individuals with long standing T1D have identified residual insulin production even years after the
onset of disease. The premise of this work, based on these and other observations, is that there are adaptive
responses of the β cells to the immunologic attack that may prevent their destruction. We previously found that
some β cells undergo “dedifferentiation”, express lower levels of β cell transcription factors, have reduced
immunogenicity, and are protected from killing. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify adaptive changes
in β cells and use this information to enhance their survival in the setting of immune attack. We found that there
was increased expression of modifiers of the epigenome such as DNMT3a and Tet2 in human and murine β
cells in vitro, during exposure to inflammatory cytokines, or in vivo during autoimmunity. We found increased
expression of TET2 in β cells in islets from humans with autoimmune pancreatitis and T1D in nPOD samples.
However, from our analysis of β cells during diabetes progression in NOD mice, those that resist autoimmune
killing have decreased expression of Tet2. Tet2 induces hydroxymethylation of methylated CpG site which is the
first step in converting a repressive to permissive epigenetic mark. We created Tet2-/- NOD mice and in adoptive
transfer studies, bone marrow transplants and direct cultures with inflammatory cytokines and diabetogenic
immune cells showed that deletion of Tet2 prevents autoimmune killing of β cells. Our data indicates that the
Tet2-deficient β cells are not only resistant to immune killing but also modify the autoimmune responses. We
hypothesize that Tet2 can modify β cells and affect their susceptibility to autoimmune killing and plan to test this
hypothesis in murine model systems and human cells. We will analyze on a single cell basis the transcriptome
and epigenome (by ATACseq) of β cells from WT and Tet2-/- mice. We will identify the DNA binding sequences
of Tet2 in β cells. To specifically identify the role of Tet2 in β cells and determine the relationship between timing
of Tet2 expression and susceptibility to killing we will create mice with tissue specific deletion of Tet2 and induce
the deletion at times throughout the development of T1D. We will analyze the differences in immune cells in Tet2
sufficient and -/- mice. In the 2nd aim we will analyze TET2 expression and associated gene expression and
epigenetic signatures in human samples from nPOD, patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, and control
subjects. Finally, we will assess the role of TET2 expression in human embryonic stem cell-derived- β cells with
and without TET2 expression in vitro and after transplantation into mice. These studies will determine the
mechanisms whereby TET2 can control β cell responses to immune attack and may identify a pathway to prevent
their destruction that is applicable to clinical settings."

This project will develop a wearable continuous monitor for reporting and predicting physiological state during
trauma, shock and sepsis with the goal of predicting morbidity, mortality, and providing feedback during medical
intervention. I can also be used as a triage tool. The proposed technology responds to technology gaps published
by the Department of Defense Combat Casualty Care Research Program and an NIH Notice of Special Interest
in Physiological Monitoring and Point of Care Technologies for Trauma Care. The hybrid technology has an ultra-
thin flexible multiple analyte sensor placed just under the skin attached to a flexible wearable patch for non-
invasive hemodynamic monitoring. Together these technologies provide real time monitoring of blood
oxygenation, heart rate, lactate, tissue oxygen, glucose, and pH. In Aim 1 we will design and construct a
minimally invasive continuous sensor for glucose, lactate, oxygen and pH. It has been shown that frequent
monitoring of these analytes not only identifies risk at initial injury, but can predict morbidity and outcomes, guide
intervention, and stratify medical conditions associated with trauma that may have overlapping or cryptic
symptoms. In Aim 2 we will design and construct a wearable patch that operates the sensor developed in Aim1
and further includes the non-invasive technology of pulse oximetry, autonomous operation, and wireless
telemetry. The wearable and sensor are both made of flexible circuits providing comfort and mechanical
matching of the indwelling component, and conformal attachment of the wearable to the skin. In Aim 3 we will
conduct a study using a porcine model of hemorrhagic injury and sensor-guided resuscitation. At the completion
of the grant, we will have a validated monitoring technology and can begin the process of applying for an
Investigational Device Exemption from the FDA to proceed to human studies."
10906179,"Prostate enlargement arising from benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) can constrict the urethra, causing bladder
outlet obstruction (BOO), a major contributing factor to the lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) that affect aging
men. The BOO bladder is capable of generating the elevated pressures necessary to overcome the rise in outlet
resistance and void through an increase in bladder smooth muscle cell mass. However, prolonged elevation in
voiding pressures induces progressive mechanobiological changes to the bladder wall that lead to LUTS,
including storage and voiding dysfunction. With rising numbers of BPH worldwide, prostate surgery to treat BOO
will increase in frequency. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand why 30% of prostrate surgeries to
treat BOO are ineffective at resolving LUTS and to identify more effective treatment strategies.
We believe the reason for this gap in knowledge is that insufficient attention has been given to understanding
the coupling between changes to the bladder wall and voiding/filling (V-F) dysfunction. Indeed, we currently
lack a full 3D biomechanical model for the whole bladder V-F process for even healthy bladders, let alone for
the BOO bladder as it goes through progressive changes over time scales of weeks and months. Our limited
understanding of bladder biomechanics is in sharp contrast to our knowledge of heart biomechanics, for which
sophisticated multi-scale, multi-physics models of the cyclic filling and emptying of the heart chambers have
been developed to understand cardiac disease and design patient specific treatments. Promisingly, there is
opportunity to capitalize on tools and experimental/computational approaches developed for other organs,
such as the heart, to rapidly advance the bladder biomechanics research field towards clinical impact.
To address this need, this R01 project will make use of state of the art in vivo and in vitro studies of BOO in a
rat model to drive the development of a digital twin of the whole BOO bladder. This data and the in silico
model will enable a mechanistic understanding of how changes to the BOO bladder cause progressive bladder
dysfunction and how this dysfunction can be ameliorated through reversal surgery and pharmacological
treatment. The focus of Aim 1 is dysfunction in the V-F process. A 3D finite element model of urodynamics
coupled with data from the BOO rat model will be used to determine how changes to the bladder drive
dysfunction in the V-F cycle, at each stage of BOO. In Aim 2, we will determine how pharmacological treatment
can be used to ameliorate bladder dysfunction. Progressive changes to bladder wall will be modeled over a
time scale of weeks using our computational framework for BOO mechanobiology. In Aim 3, we will use animal
data and the digital twin to determine mechanistic causes for bladder response to reversal surgery and identify
conditions for functional recovery with regards to surgical timing and pharmacological intervention.
Our long-term objectives are to develop a digital twin for medical research and translated to the clinic to guide
surgical intervention choices and develop pharmacologic treatment for male LUTS associated with BPH/BOO."
10825583,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic inflammation and persistent infection conditions have long been associated with increased risk of cancer.
Growing evidence suggests that cancer-associated inflammatory processes, such as lipid peroxidation, cause
genomic instability that can be linked to the development of carcinogenesis. Reactive species from lipid
peroxidation are known to damage DNA and form etheno-type adducts. Previously, four etheno DNA adducts
have been reported: 1,N6-ethenoadenine (εA), 3,N4-ethenocytosine (εC), 1,N2-ethenoguanine (1,N2-εG), and
N2,3-ethenoguanine (N2,3-εG). These etheno lesions are also generated by metabolites of the human carcinogen
vinyl chloride. Recently, a new etheno adduct, 3,N4-etheno-5-methylcytosine (ε5mC), was identified. It bears the
etheno damage on 5-methylcytosine, an important epigenetic marker in humans. Thus far, no information on the
repair and mutagenicity of ε5mC has been reported. Replication of the etheno lesions is known to cause
mutations and may constitute a critical step in the pathway leading to neoplastic transformation. Importantly for
cells, DNA repair pathways are the guardians of genomic integrity and function to return damaged DNA to its
canonical state. This research project focuses on two key repair pathways: base excision repair (BER) and direct
reversal repair (DRR). Most of the experiments that give rise to our current understanding of BER and DRR were
conducted using DNA oligomers. There is a fundamental gap in knowledge of how repair occurs in the context
of chromatin, where eukaryotic DNA is compacted in a complex hierarchy of DNA-protein interactions. At the
most fundamental level of chromatin organization, the nucleosome core particle (NCP) is the basic packaging
unit that is comprised of ds-DNA wrapped around a histone protein core. The overarching goal of the proposed
research is to understand how DNA sequence context and the packaging of DNA into chromatin influence repair
of the etheno adductome. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that BER and DRR enzymes repair etheno
lesions with different efficiencies, and these distinctive repair profiles are the result of 1) sequence context of the
lesion and interactions with the enzyme and 2) modulation of repair by the protein component of chromatin, the
histones. Guided by this novel hypothesis, strong preliminary data, and innovative techniques, the proposal
investigates three aims that: (1) define the sequence context effects (by considering the 5’ and 3’ neighboring
bases) of BER and DRR enzymes in unpackaged DNA oligomers; (2) characterize the repair profiles of the five
etheno adducts in NCPs; and (3) determine the extent to which tailless and variant histone proteins provide a
mechanism of modulating repair in chromatin. The proposed research is significant because it will reveal key
mechanisms and critical differences that influence repair of the etheno adductome and how cells minimize the
harmful consequences of these lesions. The results obtained in this work will explain in vivo observations of
alkylation damage profiles and contribute to our understanding of mutational hotspots and mutational signatures.
Therefore, the research has considerable translational potential to enhance our understanding of DNA repair
and the results can assist in the development of future therapeutic treatments that improve cellular defenses
against genomic instability."
10817893,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Diseases of excess, aberrant, or insufficient angiogenesis are responsible for a large portion of the world's
morbidity and mortality. Conditions such as peripheral artery disease, macular degeneration, coronary artery
disease, stroke, and heart failure exhibit sexual dimorphism in risk factors, prevalence, severity, or optimal
interventions. Despite widespread appreciation of these differences, the mechanisms by which sex influences
vascular conditions are incompletely understood. For example, the role of sex chromosomal complement in
angiogenic processes is ill defined. New evidence suggests that the process by which IgG1 antibodies regulate
angiogenesis in an antigen-independent manner (which we term “antibody-dependent cell-mediated
angioinhibition” or ADCAI) is strongly sexually dimorphic, with males exhibiting far greater ADCAI compared to
females. Supported by robust preliminary data, the overall hypothesis of this project is ADCAI dimorphism arises
due to expression of the Y chromosome-encoded gene DDX3Y. We will test this hypothesis in three specific
aims. 1) We will establish the precise roles of sex-biasing factors (sex chromosome complement and gonadal
secretions) in ADCAI sexual dimorphism. 2) We will determine the function of the Y chromosome-encoded
DDX3Y as a novel ADCAI regulatory gene. 3) We will quantify the sex effect on ADCAI in human cells and
specimens. Collectively, these thematically related, but independent aims will establish new foundational and
translationally relevant knowledge about the mediators and consequences of ADCAI. These studies may thereby
open new interventional avenues to modulate angiogenesis in a personalized, sex-specific manner for diverse
therapeutic applications."

Eye movement abnormalities in schizophrenia (SZ) have been documented for over 100 years, yet it remains
unknown whether fine-scale eye movements differ in this population. This is unfortunate because the neural
structures underlying oculomotor control are well-documented, implying that group differences could shed light
on the underlying illness pathophysiology. Moreover, establishing fine-scale eye movement differences could in
principle provide a distinguishing biobehavioral marker, which in turn could be used for differential diagnosis or
clinical prediction. Additionally, fine-scale eye movements contribute to everyday activities, such as recognizing
facial expressions at a distance, reading, and discriminating fine spatial stimuli. Therefore, it is conceivable that
abnormal micro- eye movements could be associated with—and even causally related to—impairments of these
visual functions in psychosis. Thus, a major goal of the research described in this proposal is to establish that
fine-scale eye movements do indeed differ among those with psychosis (Aim 1). These differences will be
assessed in people with a psychotic disorder and in well-matched healthy adults during steady fixation and in
the presence of complex foveal stimuli. In contrast to possibly all prior psychosis studies, we will use a high-
precision digital Dual Purkinje Image Eye-Tracker (1 arcmin resolution) with a head-stabilizing helmet to minimize
small head motions, and frequent re-calibrations throughout data collection. Additionally, a custom-made system
for gaze contingent display control, will enable the implementation of a state-of-the-art calibration procedure,
which effectively reduces the gaze localization error to less than 5 arcmin. Since visual acuity and reading are
often impaired among psychosis patients and may even portend a future psychotic disorder, we will attempt to
generate group differences with tasks that probe these same processes. Moreover, to establish a reference
baseline for fine oculomotor behavior and to consider hitherto unnoticed problems in fixational stability, we will
assess small eye movement differences during steady fixation without an active task. Aside from assessing
whether micro- eye movement differences characterize psychosis, we will also assess their relationship to visual
perceptual deficits (Aim 2). In particular, we will probe for correlations between microsaccade characteristics
and the magnitude of visual acuity and reading deficits. We will also consider whether trials with a higher rate
of microsaccades are related to impaired reading or impaired visual acuity compared to trials without such eye
movements, and whether image stabilization on the retina (which removes the benefits of microsaccades)
worsens acuity more for controls than for patients. Findings will inform our understanding of how eye movement
differences in psychosis are related to perception at the micro-scale, which in turn can suggest novel treatments
or interventions for improving poor visual acuity and reading."

Upper limb physical rehabilitation post stroke tends to focus mainly on remediating deficits related to motor
execution of the impaired arm. This approach can be problematic due to two major reasons: (1) efficient
movement requires both intact cognition and motor execution, and (2) previous research shows that movement
deficits depend on the side of brain damage; importantly, these deficits are present even in the “unimpaired”,
ipsilesional arm. While there is a large body of evidence on the lateralization of motor control processes,
research on lateralized cognitive processes is limited. Previous studies show that right brain damage produces
larger deficits in cognitive processes, such as working memory and action selection, than left brain damage.
Our preliminary studies examining hemisphere-specific deficits in motor execution demonstrate that ipsilesional
arm movement planning deficits in individuals with left brain damage are highly correlated with functional
independence. Surprisingly, this relationship was not found in individuals with right brain damage. Based on
our preliminary studies and prior literature, we hypothesize that increased cognitive load produces functionally
limiting deficits in the control of movement that differ based on the side of brain damage. We predict that with
increased cognitive load, movement deficits will be larger with right than left brain damage. Additionally, we
predict that functional independence will be correlated with cognitive deficits in right hemisphere damaged
individuals and with motor execution deficits in left hemisphere damaged individuals. We will utilize a novel
paradigm that integrates a cognitive challenge with an upper limb reaching task. This method provides a more
real-world design for studying how cognitive load affects functional movement compared to dual-task
paradigms that involve a cognitively-challenging task in parallel with the motor task. We will recruit 36 chronic
stroke survivors with severe hemiparesis for our studies. They will each complete two tasks on a virtual reality
motion tracking system, which are designed to assess deficits in ipsilesional arm motor execution and cognitive
aspects of movement. We will also use standardized clinical assessments of ipsilesional arm function and
functional independence. This proposal assembles an investigative team comprised of experts in cognitive
neuroscience and stroke rehabilitation to accomplish the following aims: (1) To determine whether ipsilesional
arm deficits in motor control are affected by cognitive load differently in left and right hemisphere damaged
stroke survivors with severe contralesional paresis; (2) To determine whether deficits in ipsilesional arm motor
execution and cognitive aspects of movement predict functional independence differently between left and right
hemisphere damaged stroke survivors with severe contralesional paresis. The results of these studies will be
used to develop personalized rehabilitation strategies that account for hemisphere-specific deficits in motor
control, and will be particularly useful for severely impaired stroke survivors who depend exclusively on their
ipsilesional arm to conduct activities of daily living."

Intra-host Trypanosoma cruzi parasite dynamics in naturally-infected macaques
and Chagas disease progression
 Chagas disease is a major vector borne parasitic disease cause by the
protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, with over 6 million cases in the Americas.
Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the most common and life-threathening
manifestation of Chagas disease, which develops many years after the initial infection in
20-40% of patients. However, disease progression is still poorly understood, due to the
need for prolonged follow-up, the lack of precise biomarkers, extensive parasite genetic
and biological diversity, among others. A major gap is that patients at increased risk of
developing severe disease cannot be distinguished from those who may remain in the
asymptomatic chronic stage, making any prognosis uncertain and complicating patient
care and treatment. Importantly, there is growing evidence that a large proportion of
infections are caused by multiple parasite strains. The implications of such multiple
infections on disease progression and clinical manifestations are unclear, but
interactions among strains are likely to occur, that may shape disease progression.
Therefore, our general objective is to determine the effects of T. cruzi parasite diversity
on disease progression during the chronic phase by monitoring a cohort of naturally-
infected rhesus macaques. We will follow naturally-infected Chagasic macaques from a
well established cohort of animals that have been infected for 1-6 years. Sequential
blood samples will be used to measure parasite burden by qPCR and parasite
genotyping through NGS to assess parasite strain dynamics over 24 months of follow-
up. These will be associated with ECG recordings to assess cardiac function. We will
also perform bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing of PBMCs to assess differences in
transcriptional profiles according to parasite diversity. This system immunology approach
will inform on immune correlates for disease progression. Finally, we will measure
plasma fibronectin degradation and other candidate biomarkers, to correlate with
disease progression as measured by parasite burden and ECG alterations. These
studies will be key to better understand Chagas disease progression in naturally-infected
hosts, and test for the role of parasite genetic diversity in shaping disease progression.
Together with the validation of potential biomarkers, this work is expected to have an
important translational impact by leading to better treatments and prognosis for
Chagasic patients."

 Bacteria encode a diverse array of molecular systems to defend against infecting phages. In response,
phages have devised many counter-defense strategies to overcome this immunity and re-establish infection.
Mounting evidence suggests that most bacterial defense systems and phage counter-defenses in nature have
not been identified. This is a major knowledge gap because the interplay between these systems often
determines whether a phage successfully infects its bacterial host. These phage infections, in turn, have major
impacts on the evolution and treatment of infectious disease. For instance, pathogenesis in bacteria often
evolves due to the integration of a prophage that expresses a toxin or other virulence factor. At the same time,
phages are increasingly viewed as potential therapeutics to treat bacterial infections, especially in cases where
multi-drug resistance renders conventional treatments unsuccessful. Thus, it is important to better understand
the natural diversity of bacterial defense and phage counter-defense systems. To meet this need, we will devise
new high-throughput functional selections to find defense and counter-defense systems in microbial ecosystems
and in libraries of synthesized phage open reading frames. This functional approach does not rely on sequence
similarity to predict defense and counter-defense systems, so overcomes the limitations of conventional,
homology-based discovery methods. This strategy, therefore, is expected to identify many new defense and
counter-defense genes beyond what is known currently. It is especially valuable for examining functions encoded
in phage genomes and bacterial genomic islands, as most genes from these sources are of unknown function.
Since nearly all bacteria should encode anti-phage defense systems, and almost all phages will encode counter-
defense strategies, we expect to make many new discoveries. Because these discoveries are predicted to be
novel, we will use a combination of genetic and functional assays to describe their mechanisms of action. We
will use Escherichia coli as a host for our functional selections, not only because this will allow us to construct
large functional libraries, but also because virulence in this pathogen is driven by prophage-expressed toxins
and because its phages are among those used most commonly to develop phage therapies. Thus, our findings
will not only be broadly relevant to pathogenesis and phage therapy across bacteria, but also will yield these
insights specifically in the context of this important human pathogen."
10870006,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Spinal cord Injury (SCI) produces a devastating syndrome characterized by motor dysfunction, hyper-reflexia,
spasticity, and neurogenic pain. The long-term goal of SCI therapy is to promote adaptive plasticity for
restoration of function while limiting maladaptive plasticity that results in hyper-reflexia, spasticity and
intractable pain. Recent research has indicated that both adaptive and maladaptive CNS plasticity can occur at
the level of the spinal cord to dictate recovery of function. However, the specific conditions that promote
adaptive versus maladaptive spinal plasticity in SCI are not well-understood. The central hypothesis of this
R01 is that spinal cord plasticity is shaped by aberrant peripheral stimulation in the acute phase of SCI that tips
plasticity toward a maladaptive form. This hypothesis has strong clinical/translational relevance, as
epidemiological studies indicate that peripheral injuries and early limb disuse are prevalent comorbidities in
human SCI. Up to 85% of SCI individuals presenting to level I trauma centers have peripheral injuries in
addition to CNS damage. Preliminary data demonstrate that peripheral nociceptive stimulation delivered
caudal to a complete SCI lesion produces maladaptive spinal plasticity that manifests as tactile hyper-reflexia
and spasticity. Similar effects are observed with peripheral nerve injury or forced hindlimb disuse below SCI,
and in both transection SCI and contusion SCI models. Our findings link these effects to specific alterations in
glutamate receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in the spinal ventral horn, providing a novel therapeutic target
for restoration of function after SCI. The Aims of this R01 expand on the preliminary data to: 1) test
mechanistic underpinnings of aberrant nociceptive stimulation below SCI (Aim 1), 2) evaluate whether similar
effects occur with aberrant proprioceptive stimulation driving spinal cord central neuronal hyper-
reflexia/spasticity (Aim 2), and 3) test new targets for combating maladaptive plasticity to promote adaptive
recovery in SCI using transcriptomic and transgenic technologies (Aim 3). The proposed project has
implications for shaping acute neuronal activity in polytraumatic SCI—a prevalent clinical presentation where
CNS lesions are accompanied with peripheral injuries and protracted bedrest."
10861756,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Changes in the genome such as mutagenesis, duplication, deletions, and
recombination bring about somatic diseases like cancer and drive evolutionary processes. My lab has been
focused on understanding how such genome instability events occur at incongruently higher frequencies at
certain “hotspots.” Quite different from the familiar depiction of chromosomes as stationary strings made up of
DNA, genome is more like a busy highway, where many proteins, including topoisomerases in surveillance for
irregular helical torsion, bind and/or actively modify DNA. Moreover, mega-complexes of proteins like RNA
polymerase and DNA polymerase complexes are dynamically moving along, unwinding, and forcibly distorting
DNA while carrying out transcription and replication, sometimes physically colliding with each other. In order to
explain why mutation/recombination hotspots are often located within actively transcribed regions, we viewed
the multiple DNA-involving processes as an interactive system rather than as each independent activity and
identified transcription-associated causes of genome instability. My work was instrumental in showing that
mutations resulting from the non-canonical residues, uracil and ribonucleotide, are highly elevated upon
transcription activation. Subsequently, novel discoveries in my lab led to the model that non-replicative DNA
synthesis occurring in G1- and G2-phases of the cell cycles results in higher uracil density in actively
transcribed genes. We also made key findings linking the transcription-generated negative torsional stress with
the elevated recombination associated with the DNA secondary structure G-quadruplex or G4 DNA. We further
identified G4 DNA-binding proteins that either suppress or exacerbate such G4 DNA-induced genome
instability. The central goal of my research program is to uncover fundamental and conserved mechanism
underlying mutagenesis and genome rearrangements, which will be important for both the cellular
transformation into cancers and responses to chemotherapeutics. Building upon our previous findings, we will
continue to address important remaining questions by (1) using tractable genetic approaches to study
transcription-associated genome instability in the simple eukaryotic model organism Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, (2) developing innovative approaches to test the model of uracil/ribonucleotide incorporation into
DNA during G1 and G2, and (3) defining the functional and structural interaction between key G4 DNA-binding
proteins and G4 DNA both in vitro and in vivo.
 Our ongoing investigation should further the understanding of how transcription, replication, and DNA
repair work in conjunction either for the benefit or the detriment of genome integrity. Having a comprehensive
picture of these interconnected and dynamic processes occurring on the genome will help in predicting how to
suppress and correct genome instability events adverse to normal cellular functions."

This is a proposal to continue a long-standing postdoctoral training program at Brandeis
University. This program integrates intensive quantitative and experimental training in a
collaborative environment to produce neuroscientists who go on to successful careers applying
these skills to solve the myriad problems posed by disorders of the nervous system. We will take
a diverse and talented set of individuals with Ph.D.s in neuroscience, physics, math, computer
science, engineering, and biological sciences and give them systematic and integrative training
in the use of modern quantitative/analytical approaches bridging levels of analysis to
understand nervous system function. We have designed a modular and collaborative training
structure that allows trainees with disparate backgrounds to acquire the skills, training and
flexibility they need to thrive as modern neuroscientists. Our program comprises a two-year
sequence that systematically builds quantitative literacy, fluency with statistical methods and
quantitative tools, training in rigor, experimental design and ethics, and grant-writing and
communication skills. We intend to recruit 4 Postdoctoral Trainees/year into this 2-year
program for a total of 8 slots, which maintains the previous level of support. We will magnify the
impact of this training program by encouraging all Neuroscience postdocs, not only those
appointed to the training grant, to participate. This will serve the purpose of building a
collaborative postdoc community that collectively possesses and disseminates a broad set of
quantitative skills, and where horizontal and vertical transmission of these skills will be an
important feature of training. The richer this trainee and mentor community is, the more
effective the training will be. To this end, we are committed to enhancing the diversity of our
training program at all levels, and a set of concrete steps to accomplish this are proposed."
10824360,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Healthy adults produce 2 million erythrocytes every second through the process of basal erythropoiesis.
Insufficient erythrocyte production causes anemia, which is a significant global human health problem. During
regeneration or “stress erythropoiesis” to recover from anemia, erythrocyte production further increases. Stress
erythropoiesis is critical for recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation and infection;
however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Both basal and stress erythropoiesis are regulated by
erythropoietin (Epo) and its receptor EpoR. Epo binding to the EpoR activates the associated tyrosine kinase
JAK2, which initiate downstream signaling leading to survival, proliferation and differentiation of erythroid cells.
While EpoR signaling in more differentiated erythroid precursors has been extensively studied, EpoR signaling
in early progenitors has not been elucidated.
This proposal is based on our recent findings of a previously unrecognized population of early colony-forming
erythroid progenitors (CFU-E), which we named stress CFU-E or sCFU-E. sCFU-E are targets of Epo, are only
expanded in erythroid stress, and are essential for recovery of the erythron. sCFU-E are also hijacked by the
activating JAK2 mutant, JAK2(V617F), to drive erythrocytosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms. In preliminary
studies, we discovered that sCFU-E proliferation and differentiation involve novel Epo/EpoR signaling. We
found that Epo induces expression of Nocturnin, a NADP(H) phosphatase that regulates cellular oxidative
stress to promote sCFU-E proliferation. Epo also induces expression of SLC23A2, an ascorbate (Vitamin C)
transporter, in sCFU-E. sCFU-E accumulates high levels of ascorbate, and ascorbate accelerates sCFU-E
differentiation. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which Nocturnin and ascorbate drive
proliferation and differentiation of sCFU-E in the context of stress erythropoiesis and erythrocytosis. Aim 1 will
determine the role of ascorbate import on sCFU-E function. Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms underlying
ascorbate-dependent sCFU-E differentiation. Aim 3 will determine the role of Nocturnin and oxidative stress
signaling in sCFU-E proliferation. These results will elucidate mechanisms controlling stress erythropoiesis and
erythrocytosis, and may lead to novel therapeutic interventions for anemia and those that can target
erythrocytosis while preserving basal erythropoiesis."

 Human milk, whether maternal or pasteurized donor human milk, is considered the ideal nutrition for
preterm infants. In addition to serving as a source of amino acids to support infant growth, human milk proteins
encode cryptic bioactive peptides released during infant digestion. These peptides can be found in the infant
intestine luminal fluid and have an array of biological activities, including antimicrobial, bifidogenic,
immunomodulatory, and effects on intestinal physiology. Although
peptides
responsible
peptides
 our initial work demonstrates that milk
released and present in the infant intestine have beneficial activities, identifying the specific peptides
for these gut-related actions has been limited. Thus, there is a critical need to determine the specific
released within the infant's gastrointestinal tract that mediate these bioactivities.
Our long-term goal is to leverage the biology of human milk to promote optimal development and growth
of preterm infants ex utero. The overall objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the presence and identities
of gut health-promoting human milk protein-derived peptides within the preterm infant intestine. Our central
hypothesis is that bioactive peptides are released in the infant intestine to modulate gut physiology through the
microbiome, intestinal epithelium, and immune system. Our specific aims are to determine the 1) antimicrobial
and bifidogenic activity, 2) intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific effects (barrier function, proliferation,
differentiation) and 3) macrophage-immunomodulatory activity of peptides in the intestinal contents of preterm
infants fed human milk. For each of these activities, we will identify and validate specific peptides. Our approach
will be to collect intestinal samples from preterm neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after
feeding human milk, extract the peptide component from these samples, test their antibacterial, bifidogenic,
IEC-modulatory and macrophage-immunomodulatory activity in vitro, and identify candidate bioactive peptides
via mass spectrometry, database searching, and statistical techniques to be synthesized and tested for function.
As a sub-aim, we will perform this analysis for maternal and pasteurized donor human milk.
 This research is innovative because it identifies, for the first time, bioactivities of peptides released during
in vivo infant digestion, provides a means for identifying candidate bioactive peptides and establishes a pipeline
for testing candidate peptides in relevant model systems, including neonatal human enteroids. At the conclusion
of this project, we expect to 1) identify the gut health-related bioactivity of human milk protein-derived peptide
extracts from the preterm infant intestine and 2) identify specific peptides present in the infant intestine that can
modulate the microbiome, IECs, and macrophages. The positive impact of this research is that it will provide
the basis for leveraging milk-derived, bioactive peptides to improve infant gut health for preterm and potentially
all infants."
10918155,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 The central premise of precision medicine is that an individual’s unique physiologic characteristics play
a significant role in disease vulnerability and response to specific therapies. To make progress towards
precision medicine in psychiatry it is imperative to move beyond group-based studies that disregard individual
variations as noise, and instead interpret individual variations in the context of the normal-range of biological
systems, which is consistent with the Research Domain Criteria [RDoC] paradigm.
 In response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) regarding the use of Human Connectome Data for
Secondary Analysis we propose to use normative modeling (‘brain growth charting’) techniques to generate a
comprehensive reference atlas for brain microstructure across the lifespan that contains age and sex based
normative information for individual brain regions using publicly available connectome data (>50,000 individual
datasets, age 10-100 years). We chose to target brain microstructure because postmortem and neuroimaging
studies have implicated microstructural involvement in virtually all major psychiatric disorders. We will also
create a web-based ecosystem that contains the relevant workflow components, including an option to
calibrate models to new datasets. In addition to publishing final models and code as Jupyter notebooks, we will
design a graphical user interface to reduce barriers for neuroscientists with limited experience in command line
coding and to maximize the impact of our work. Taken together, this approach will provide a problem-agnostic,
quantitative framework for characterizing variations at the individual level and give us a paradigm-shifting
opportunity to advance clinical translation, where information of an individual patient’s brain microstructure can
be leveraged to forecast the probability of a psychiatric condition, clinical outcomes, or response to treatment.
 We will showcase the value of this approach for psychiatric applications by determining the extent and
clinical relevance of individual microstructure deviations in early psychosis patients. We chose this patient
population because it is genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous, confounds of disease chronicity and
antipsychotic medication exposure are limited, and because we have found that subtle microstructural
abnormalities are already present at illness onset and associated with clinical and outcome variables. Using
publicly available connectome data, we first will assess the extent of individual microstructure variations and
assess heterogeneity in microstructural deviations from the norm in this patient population. We will then test
the relationships between individual microstructure variations and key clinical variables, and determine if
individual microstructural variations can be used to identify clinical subtypes. This constitutes a pivotal step
towards precision psychiatry, where patients are conceptualized based on their unique physiologic
characteristics, and insights from individual imaging signatures guide medical decision making."

Human brain development represents perhaps the pinnacle of complex organ specification, and an ideal model
system for understanding 1) how normal development can produce all the cell types necessary for human
cognition and 2) how genetic variation can perturb this process and lead to disease. We will generate large-scale
single cell data sets to develop accurate models capable of predicting the effects of both genetic changes to
regulatory elements and perturbations to trans-acting regulatory factors on gene expression during the complex
developmental process of human brain development. We will study two highly medically relevant, human, in
vitro, temporally dynamic differentiation systems that faithfully recapitulate fetal differentiation patterns: hiPSC-
derived cerebral cortical and spinal cord organoids. For each of these differentiation trajectories, we will work in
distinct aims toward mapping, perturbing, modeling, validating, and learning: Mapping: we will generate
systematic, single cell multi-omic (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and protein quantification) data to map regulatory
elements, chromatin contacts, RNA polymerase, protein binding, and gene expression through differentiation of
hiPSCs to brain tissue. Perturbing: We will use CRISPR-based methods to comprehensively identify TFs
required for differentiation and map the single-cell gene regulatory and expression impact of perturbing a subset
of these factors at multiple time points across these differentiation trajectories. Modeling: We will develop multi-
input nucleotide-resolved neural networks to learn dynamic gene regulatory networks using these mapping and
perturbation data sets. These models will aim to understand the changing landscape of regulation and grammars
of transcription factor motifs over differentiation time, and will predict both chromatin and gene expression effects
expected from genetic perturbations. Validating: We will apply our network models to identify, investigate, and
experimentally test perturbations relevant to understanding disease variation, by knocking down transcription
factors, perturbing regulatory elements, and editing disease-associated noncoding variants. Learning and
comparing: Finally, we will extract and test molecular properties of transcription factor function from validated
models, and compare experimental and modeling approaches to better understand accuracy, advantages, and
disadvantages. Successful completion of our project will provide mechanistic interpretations for how genetic
variants may impact development (by disrupting regulatory element that in turn disrupt gene expression) in brain
development. Our Stanford team comprises a diverse team of investigators with a history of productive
collaboration, and with expertise in genomics methods development (Greenleaf, Engreitz), single cell methods
and analysis (Greenleaf, Pasca), 3D cellular models of human brain (Pasca), and deep learning for genomic
data sets (Kundaje). The output of this project will be a gold-standard data set defining the trans-acting factor
network driving development, and a model capturing these complex dynamics capable of quantitatively linking
changes in genotype to effects on genome function and phenotype in brain and spinal cord development."
10784762,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over the last decade, there has been an exponential increase in identified genetic causes of neurodevelopmental
disorders and epilepsy. With more than 100 genes identified, understanding how phenotypes relate to specific
genetic variants is critical given the clinical complexity of developmental brain disorders. Given that treatment
and prognosis is dependent on understanding genotype-phenotype correlations, there is a critical need to better
assess clinical features in genetic epilepsies. However, phenotyping is a time-consuming, manual task with
limited throughput. To overcome this bottleneck, we have developed a novel approach, based on the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO) to capture and analyze longitudinal phenotypic data. In our preliminary data for
STXBP1- and SCN8A-related disorders, which we have reconstructed for >550 patient months, we identified
unique natural histories, outcomes, and distinct response patterns to specific treatment strategies. Natural history
and treatment response in pediatric epilepsies are deeply intertwined and often difficult to disentangle.
Accordingly, a comprehensive assessment of genetic epilepsies needs to account for two factors, subgroups
with common clinical trajectories as well as gene-specific treatment responses. Our suggested project therefore
has two aims. First, we plan to detect relevant subgroups in genetic epilepsies based on longitudinal clinical data
(Aim #1). We will reconstruct longitudinal trajectories and outcomes in the 15 most common genetic epilepsies
with 50-75 individuals per gene to delineate longitudinal seizure burden, seizures types, and developmental
milestones. Based on this, we will then identify subgroups defined by clinical features and global clinical
resemblance, as well as variant and gene groups. In addition (Aim #2), we will identify specific treatment
responses in genetic epilepsies using standardized phenotypes. We will combine reconstructed natural history
with treatment data to compare reduction in seizure frequencies and effect on maintaining seizure freedom
across >20 treatment strategies with the goal to identify the most effective treatment strategy when adjusting for
age and seizure type. Finally, we will also compare medication response across major variant classes and across
all genetic etiologies combined. Our team has previously pioneered computational phenotype analysis in the
epilepsies, positioning us uniquely to address these questions. Our analysis, mapping longitudinal clinical data
to a harmonized format will provide unprecedented granularity in deciphering the trajectory of genetic epilepsies,
informing clinical practice in these conditions. We hope that these results will provide a template for the analysis
of the limited clinical data in rare diseases in order to maximize treatment-relevant information, especially in
conditions with complex, longitudinal disease histories."
10849712,"Project Summary/Abstract
Age-related neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and related tauopathies, are a major
therapeutic challenge. There are critical brain regions implicated in disease pathogenesis and overtime the
whole or a large portion of the brain is affected. Therefore, both a focal and broad brain treatment approach is
needed to achieve long-term therapeutic benefit. Gene therapy is the use of genetic material to target disease
etiology. Viral vectors are used to deliver therapeutic genes to cells to provide long-lasting intervention from a
single treatment. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors are highly used due to their efficient
gene transfer, broad serotype-dependent tropism, low risk of insertional mutagenesis, and long-term transgene
expression in non-dividing cells, such as neurons. AAV9 is currently the most frequently used serotype for
treating neurological disorders as it can be delivered in blood or cerebral spinal fluid to broadly transduce the
brain in a dose-dependent manner. Direct brain injections are effective for focal brain treatments, but are an
invasive procedure. With non-invasive systemic delivery, high vector doses are needed to achieve sufficient
brain transduction in adults. The greater the number of viral particles received increases the risk of severe
immune responses and inhibits use in adults due to manufacturing considerations. We and others have
demonstrated that use of FUS to open the BBB can significantly reduce systemic vector doses and target rAAV
vectors to select brain regions. While promising for focal treatments, this then limits the ability of AAV9 to
efficiently transduce non-targeted brain regions. CSF delivery of AAV9 significantly reduces the amount of
vector needed to achieve equivalent or greater brain transduction compared to systemic delivery and achieves
high CNS transduction relative to the site of injection. Therefore, we predict that IT delivery of AAV9 combined
with transcranial FUS will allow for both focal and broad targeting of gene therapies to the brain and be an
effective delivery approach for age-related neurodegenerative diseases. This grant will develop the use of
combined FUS and IT injection as an efficient delivery method of AAV vectors to the brain, define mechanisms
for this enhancement, determine vector capsid and promoter usage, and test this application in a mouse model
of tauopathy. If we are successful, this approach can be readily translated for treating neurodegenerative
diseases."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with higher rates of lung cancer among
Black versus White men, despite Black populations having lower smoking rates, smoking fewer cigarettes per
day, and being less likely to smoke heavily. Randomized trials demonstrated early detection of lung cancer
with annual low dose computed tomography reduces lung cancer mortality by 20-33% in high-risk populations.
In 2013 the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended annual lung cancer screening (LCS)
in individuals ages 55-80 years who currently or former (quit within 15 years) smoked at least 30 pack-years.
Some studies suggested the 2013 USPSTF LCS eligibility criteria under selected women and Black individuals
who tend to smoke less intensely yet have increased risk of developing lung cancer. In 2021, the USPSTF
expanded their LCS recommendations to include individuals ages 50-80 years with at least a 20 pack-year
history, increasing the number eligible by more than 80% to 14.5 million U.S. adults. These expanded criteria
will result in higher relative increases in screening eligibility for women versus men and non-Hispanic Black
versus non-Hispanic White populations. Yet, the impact of the expanded 2021 USPSTF eligibility criteria on
screening practice and outcomes is unknown. The objective of this application is to understand how the
updated 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations are implemented in practice and quantify the impact of the new
recommendations on the LCS care continuum from adherence to performance. Our central hypothesis is that
there will be race and sex-based differences in the benefits and harms of LCS among newly eligible individuals
(e.g., ages 50-54 years or smoking 20-29 P-Y) because of heterogeneity in the baseline risk of developing lung
cancer. Guided by strong preliminary data, the hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following specific
aims: 1) Evaluate patients’ and clinicians' attitudes, knowledge, and experiences with the expanded 2021
USPSTF LCS recommendations; 2) Determine the impact of the 2013 vs. 2021 USPSTF LCS eligibility criteria
across the screening care continuum in terms of (a) baseline lung cancer risk in the population screened, (b)
adherence to annual LCS, and (c) receipt of recommended care following an abnormal LCS result; and 3)
Compare the performance of LDCT LCS in individuals screened per the USPSTF 2013 criteria versus the 2021
newly eligible criteria. The study is innovative in combining survey and quantitative methods in a large, diverse,
community-based population to evaluate the impact of the 2021 USPSTF LCS recommendations on LCS care
patterns and outcomes. The proposed research is significant because it will quantify the experiences of LCS in
the 14.5 million individuals now eligible for screening. The findings are expected to advance and expand our
understanding of LCS in diverse populations and settings which will enable clinicians to deliver more evidence
based, high-quality LCS care."

RELEVANCE: The COVID-19 pandemic upended life in the United States through social distancing policies,
such as remote work mandates, to halt the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Weight gain and changes
in physical activity, dietary intake, and other health behaviors related to cardio-metabolic conditions were
reported during and immediately following the acute lockdown period. Two years after the acute lockdown
period, nearly one-third of Americans continue to work remotely and understanding whether these early cardio-
metabolic health changes persisted will have important implications for cardio-metabolic health in the decades
to come. OBJECTIVES: To quantify the magnitude, modifying characteristics, and mechanisms associated
with cardio-metabolic health changes in US adults >1 year after the post-acute lockdown period. DESIGN: We
build on a high-quality community-based cohort study of ~140,000 adults, the American Cancer Society
Cancer Prevention Study 3 (CPS-3). CPS-3 participants provided detailed health behavior, weight status,
medical history, and socioeconomic data at triennial surveys since enrollment (2013). The 2021-22 survey
supplements standard modules with information specifically designed to measure individual experiences of the
pandemic environment such as changes to work and caregiving responsibilities. We will use geocodes to link
individual data with measures of the severity of the local pandemic environment, measured by local policy
restrictions, mobility reductions, and epidemiologic risks. We will examine the overall impact of the pandemic
environment on weight status and cardio-metabolic health behaviors (dietary intake, physical activity,
sedentary time, sleep patterns, tobacco use, and alcohol use). In AIM 1A, we will evaluate the impact of the
pandemic environment on changes in weight status and cardio-metabolic health behaviors. In Aim 1B, we will
identify population characteristics that modify the pandemic’s impact on changes in cardio-metabolic health. In
AIM 2, we will evaluate potential mechanisms linking the pandemic environment and weight status, with
special emphasis on remote work policies. IMPACT: This national investigation with prospectively collected ata
before and during the pandemic will provide insight into the cardio-metabolic health sequelae of the COVID-19
pandemic. As we move into the post-pandemic recovery phase, findings may inform policy decisions regarding
continuation of remote work, as well as future priority areas and priority populations for cardio-metabolic health
promotion."

 This candidate is requesting support for a four-year program of training and research to use digital
phenotyping to gain a novel understanding of how digital media influences like exposure to drug and alcohol-
related content online can impact adolescent substance procurement and use. Addressing adolescent
substance use is challenging due to the diverse social and environmental factors that can impact a youth’s
decision to experiment with drugs or alcohol. Digital media use, including online exposure to substance-related
content, is one such potential factor of growing daily influence in adolescent lives. However, little is currently
known about how exposure to drug and alcohol-related content differs across media platforms (e.g. gaming,
social media), nor whether exposure on one media platform may be more likely to facilitate drug procurement
or precipitate an instance of substance use. This limitation in our understanding of these relationships is
secondary to both recall bias and the cross-sectional survey methodology used in prior studies. This project
will leverage novel digital phenotyping (DP) technology to collect smartphone sensor data in combination with
active surveys about digital media exposures and substance use. In this manner, we plan to identify more
accurately those digital media exposures and experiences that impact adolescent use of drugs and alcohol,
and improve upon existing clinical guidance accordingly. In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build
upon her previous experience in use of digital phenotyping to understand high-risk adolescent digital media
use. Her training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis, 2) design
and implementation of digital phenotyping tools that capture high-risk digital experiences/exposures in real
time, 3) design and piloting of ecological momentary intervention protocols, and 4) responsible conduct of
digital phenotyping research in adolescents with a history of substance use.
 In line with NIDA’s mission of identifying behavioral, environmental and social causes of substance use
across the lifespan, this research plan will 1) determine which subtypes of digital media use are more
frequently associated with exposure to drug and alcohol-related content and 2) assess which exposures are
more frequently associated with instances of substance procurement and use. We will also explore the
potential moderating effects of psychiatric symptoms and online victimization on the relationship between
exposure to substance-related content and substance use. This study will be performed across 2 years in
subjects between 15 and 18 years of age. A subsequent R01 proposal will then outline the design and pilot of
an ecological momentary intervention protocol with the goal of intervening in real time upon digital
exposures/experiences associated with adolescent substance use."
10828893,"Project Summary/Abstract:
This proposal describes a five-year research and career development plan intended to support the applicant’s
progression to an independent physician-scientist investigating mechanisms of lung myofibroblast (MF) de-
differentiation/clearance and pulmonary fibrosis resolution.
Research Plan: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the deadliest fibrotic lung disease, affecting millions of
individuals worldwide, with limited treatment options that fail to reverse established fibrosis. MFs are the
ultimate effector cells of IPF whose persistence following wound repair – a consequence of their apoptosis
resistance – leads to progressive lung scarring and stiffness, distorting tissue architecture and impairing gas
exchange. Clearance of lung MFs – through their phenotypic de-differentiation and restoration of apoptosis
sensitivity – has the potential to resolve fibrosis. The applicant has discovered that lung MF de-differentiation
can proceed via distinct transitional phenotypes and that post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs is crucial to
this process. In this proposal, he will investigate the role of the endogenous anti-fibrotic brake cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) and its regulation of the master post-transcriptional regulator human antigen R (HuR)
in MF de-differentiation and fibrosis resolution.
Applicant and Training Plan: The applicant holds an MD degree and has completed clinical training in Internal
Medicine, Pulmonary, and Critical Care Medicine. During his fellowship and prior research endeavors, he has
gained experience with in vitro systems and basic lab techniques in fibroblast biology. As part of his career
development, the applicant will participate in mentored research designed to develop new knowledge and
proficiency in RNA biology, CRISPR/Cas9 techniques, immunofluorescence microscopy, bioinformatics, and
use of novel transgenic mice for in vivo modeling and investigation of pulmonary fibrosis. Acquiring these new
skills and experiences will greatly facilitate his development into an independent investigator studying the
mechanisms by which MFs can be de-differentiated and cleared, enabling strategies to promote fibrosis
resolution. Training in these areas will be acquired under the guidance of his experienced mentoring team, and
through participation in seminars, lab meetings, coursework, workshops, and national meetings. He will also
receive training in grant writing and responsible conduct of research. The outstanding institutional research
environment provides the applicant abundant opportunities for interaction with investigators in RNA and
molecular biology, pulmonary and extra-pulmonary fibrosis, as well as with basic and translational scientists.
Available facilities for advanced imaging, RNA sequencing, and transgenic animal modeling will be utilized.
This application will thus enable a well-trained and committed junior investigator to develop an independent
career in the investigation of cellular and molecular mechanisms that can be translated into the resolution of
established pulmonary fibrosis – the holy grail of research in this field and an enormous unmet clinical need."
10771278,"Abstract Malassezia yeasts are lipophilic and are the most abundant fungi of the skin microbiome of warm-
blooded animals. In addition to a commensal lifestyle, Malassezia yeasts are associated with skin diseases
and also bloodstream infection. Studies have linked Malassezia in the GI tract as a risk factor for Crohn's
Disease in patients with CARD9 mutations and potentially in pancreatic cancer progression, whereas
Malassezia in the lung has been linked to Cystic Fibrosis exacerbation. In parallel, Candida auris has
emerged globally and is frequently drug-resistant and increasingly causing hospital-acquired skin
colonization with significant risk of systemic infection with significant morbidity and mortality. Julie Segre and
colleagues have developed a mouse model of Candida auris colonization and found that human skin
mycobiome dysbiosis, likely caused by antibiotics and antifungal drugs, shifts skin colonization from
Malassezia-dominant to Candida-species dominant patterns prior to Candida auris systemic infections.
 Genetic and genomics studies from our group and others have advanced the state of the art for the study
of Malassezia species and their interactions with bacteria and fungi in the skin microbiome and the host. We
developed an Agrobacterium tumefaciens approach enabling generation of both random and targeted
mutants of two Malassezia species, and applied these tools to study functions of Malassezia genes with roles
in drug action and host-pathogen interactions. We have conducted extensive genomic analysis, contributing
genome annotation via proteomics and obtaining complete telomere-telomere, well-annotated Malassezia
reference genomes. Our past studies on Candida species defined a globally conserved role of calcineurin in
fungal pathogenesis, advanced genomics across the Candida pathogenic species complex, and documented
that Candida lusitaniae, closely related to Candida auris, has a complete sexual cycle. Our key collaborator
Salome LeibundGut-Landmann has developed a murine skin model for Malassezia integral to these studies.
 Here we propose to study the interactions of Malassezia with Candida auris in dysbiosis of the skin
microbiome as a risk factor for systemic infection. In Aim 1 we propose to focus on 1) a novel dsRNA
Malassezia mycovirus we discovered and its encoded candidate protein effector by generating and studying
strains cured of either or both viral RNAs, and 2) Malassezia secreted proteins (including allergens and
proteases) by studying gene deletion mutants as well as random insertion mutants. In Aim 2, Malassezia
virus-infected, virus-semi-cured, and virus-cured strains and mutants generated in Aim 1 will be studied with
in vitro and in vivo models to define molecular mechanisms of interactions with Candida auris and the host.
The studies proposed will advance the field, providing insights as a foundation for studies aiming to elucidate
the beneficial roles Malassezia plays as skin commensals that protect the human host from systemic infection
by fungal pathogens through competitive and exclusive colonization of the skin microenvironment."
10833194,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) Network aims to propel discovery of new
biological processes in human health and disease that are mediated by genomic variation in somatic tissues.
We propose to establish the WashU-VAI Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) Program Genome
Characterization Center (SMaHT-GCC). A fundamental goal of our proposed GCC is to generate high throughput,
high quality, and high consistency genomic DNA and RNA sequencing data, ands to construct a comprehensive
catalogue of the human somatic variation together with other members of the Network. First, we will establish
and manage a collaborative, efficient, transparent, and flexible GCC as an integral component of the SMaHT
Network. We will leverage our experience in participating and leading many past and current genomics consortia
to design and implement our GCC. The GCC will manage center administration, maintain high quality,
sustainable, and on-time data production, develop and implement data management plans, conduct data quality
assurance and integrative data analysis, and fully engage with the entire SMaHT Network. Second, we will
generate high quality, high throughput, comprehensive and sustainable genomics datasets for the
characterization of human somatic mosaicism, using state-of-the-art technologies. We capitalize on our past
experience in generating high quality sequencing-based genomic resources, to design and implement our data
production plan. We recommend a collection of human tissue types, and will implement four core genomics
assays to profile sample received from SMaHT Tissue Procurement Center. We aim to deliver high throughput,
high quality, and high consistency genomic DNA and RNA sequencing data to the SMaHT Data Analysis Center.
Third, we will develop and maintain a modern, efficient, scalable, and interactive data management and
processing system that seamlessly interfaces with the SMaHT Data Analysis Center. We will leverage our
experience in scientific computing, information technology system, large genomic data management and
integration, and community engagement to design and implement our data management plan. We will build a
streamlined, efficient data infrastructure to manage GCC data and collaborate with SMaHT DAC. Fourth, we will
develop and implement data analysis and visualization solutions for the SMaHT-GCC data. We will leverage our
extensive experience in genomic data analysis and integration, bioinformatics tool development as well as data
visualization in the implementation of our data analysis and visualization plan. We will also bring in unique
expertise in analyzing transposable elements and epigenomics data. We will contribute to the Network-wide data
analysis, and facilitate the characterization of a full spectrum of the human somatic mosaicism."
10873982,"Project Summary
Currently no method exists that would allow physicians to rapidly and reliably establish T-cell immunity against
tumor antigens. Bioinformatics tools can predict antigens on cancer cells that are recognized by T cells, but the
vaccines based on them often fail because the immunized individuals have too few T cells with the appropriate
receptors or lack them altogether. The overall goal of our research proposal is to resolve this problem by
developing injectable nanoreagents that introduce into the peripheral T-cell repertoire engineered T-cell
receptors (TCRs) that optimally bind the most prevalent vaccine epitope. Specifically, we hypothesize that a
customized specificity can be programmed into T cell populations by combining anti-cancer vaccines with
techniques that genetically enable endogenous CD8 T cells to express TCRs specific for the vaccines. We
further hypothesize that we can use this platform to program CD4 T helper cells with defined MHC class-II-
restricted TCRs, and thereby improve tumor-specific CD8 lymphocyte and B cell responses to tumor antigens
compared to conventional immunization methods. Our multidisciplinary team of immunologists, bioengineers
and geneticists has already established that intramuscularly injected nanoparticles can deliver engineered TCR
genes into host T cells so they recognize cancer vaccine antigen. Following rapid vaccine-induced expansion,
nanoparticle-programmed T cells ultimately differentiate into long-lived memory T cells. Our long-term goal is
to develop a full suite of nanoparticles drugs that would allow physicians to rapidly establish anti-cancer
immunity by introducing exogenous antigen-specific TCRs into the patient's T-cell pool. As essential steps
toward achieving this goal, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) To test the wider applicability and long-
term safety of programming vaccine specificity into CD8+ T cells, (2) to quantify the degree to which host
CD4+ T cells programmed with TCRs to cancer-vaccine antigens boost the immune response, and (3) to
determine if providing optimized CD4 T-cell help and reversing tumor immune evasion mechanisms enables in
situ programmed vaccine-specific T cells to eradicate disease. We believe that data, reagents, and technology
systems generated by our research will provide a conceptual framework for the design of a broad repertoire of
gene modification systems designed to generate selective immunity against any type of cancer. Using these in
the clinic could make cancer vaccines not only more effective, but also reduce the likelihood of vaccine failure."
10895985,"Oral and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) together rank as the sixth most common cancer
worldwide, accounting for 400,000 new cancer cases each year. Two-thirds of these cancers occur in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs). While the 5-year survival rate in the U.S. is 62%, the survival rate is only 10-
40% and cure rate around 30% in the developing world. The poor survival rate in LMICs is mainly due to late
diagnosis and the resultant progression of disease to an advanced stage at diagnosis. Therefore, it is imperative
to diagnose precursor and malignant lesions in LRS early and expeditiously.
 To meet the need for technologies that enable comprehensive oral cancer screening and diagnosis in low
resource settings (LRS) to identify the suspicious lesions, triage the high-risk subjects and thereby enable
appropriate treatment management and follow up, this project brings together an interdisciplinary team with
complementary expertise in optical imaging, oncology, deep learning, technology translation, and
commercialization. The team will develop, validate, and clinically translate a multimodal intraoral imaging
system for oral cancer detection and diagnosis with better sensitivity and specificity. This work will
address key barriers to adopting optical imaging techniques for oral cancer in LRS by building on the team’s
experience in 1) developing and evaluating dual-mode (polarized white light imaging [pWLI] and
autofluorescence imaging [AFI]) mobile imaging probes; 2) evaluating a low-cost, portable optical coherence
tomography (OCT) system for oral cancer detection and diagnosis in a nodal center setting in India; and 3)
developing and evaluating deep learning-based image classification algorithms for clinical decision-making
guidance. As each of these key techniques has been demonstrated separately for oral cancer imaging in LRS,
the potential of successfully developing a multimodal intraoral imaging system for accurate, objective and
location-resolved diagnosis of oral cancer and transitioning to a new capability to medical professionals in LRS
is very high. To achieve the project objective, the team proposes three Aims: 1) develop a portable, semi-flexible,
and compact multimodal intraoral imaging system; 2) evaluate the clinical feasibility of the prototyped intraoral
imaging system and develop deep learning-based image processing algorithms for early detection, diagnosis,
and mapping of oral dysplastic and malignant lesions; and 3) validate the capability of the prototyped intraoral
imaging system for diagnosing oral dysplasia and malignant lesions.
 Successful completion of this project will lead to the transition of a multimodal intraoral imaging system
and deep learning image classification that leverage the individual strengths of multiple technologies and deliver
new and urgently-needed capabilities to the end users in LRS. This integrated system will 1) detect suspicious
regions with high sensitivity and specificity; 2) triage the high-risk subjects; and 3) guide the selection of biopsy
sites and map lesion heterogeneity to improve treatment planning and intra-operative guidance."
10892049,"Although locally invasive prostate cancer is nearly always curable, metastatic prostate cancer is usually fatal.
Our research is focused on elucidating mechanisms that promote metastatic progression and underlie
phenotypic heterogeneity of metastases. Toward this end, we have developed a series of genetically engineered
mouse models (GEMMs) that recapitulate the phenotypic heterogeneity of metastatic prostate cancer. The
centerpiece of this collection of GEMMs is the NPKEYFP mouse model, which develops highly penetrant bone
metastasis. This model is complemented by additional GEMMs, namely the NPMEYFP and NPp53EYFP mice, that
display distinctive metastatic phenotypes. We have performed transcriptomic analyses at the bulk tissue and
single-cell level of prostate tumors and metastases from these GEMMs to identify candidate drivers (master
regulators (MRs)) of metastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity. Furthermore, we have isolated
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from these metastatic GEMMs to study their heterogeneity at the cellular level. In
particular, we have established a pipeline to isolate and molecularly characterize individual CTCs as organoids
and to study the CTCs at the single-cell level. Our investigations have uncovered several themes that shape the
direction of our research. In particular, our findings support the concept that specific mutational events (such as
loss of function of p53 and activation of MYC and RAS signaling) as well as cellular plasticity are key drivers of
metastatic progression and phenotypic heterogeneity.
Thus, we will investigate our hypothesis that heterogeneity of metastasis represents the culmination of
molecular, cellular, and organismal differences, as follows: In Aim 1, we will study mechanisms of metastatic
progression by: (a) investigating the role of the histone methyltransferase NSD2 by analyses of a new GEMM
with gain of function of NSD2 in prostate tumors; and (b) studying cell-intrinsic mechanisms of metastatic
progression at the single-cell level in primary tumors and lung and bone metastases. In Aim 2, we will investigate
molecular mechanisms of phenotypic heterogeneity of metastasis by analyses of our GEMMs that display a
range of metastatic phenotypes. In Aim 3, we will examine cellular heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells (CTCs)
at the single-cell level using organoid models and single-cell sequencing approaches. Taken together, our
studies are highly innovative in their combination of sophisticated inducible mouse models, single-cell analyses,
organoid culture methods, and computational systems approaches to investigate a central problem in cancer
biology. Our studies of precision modeling of prostate cancer metastasis may ultimately help guide individualized
patient care."

Core Leader: Vivianna M. Van Deerlin, MD, PhD; Core Co-leader: Corey T. McMillan, PhD
The focus of the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) is to
develop a mechanistic understanding of the still evolving complexity of Alzheimer disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRD) by studying the spectrum of disease from earliest onset through progressive stages of
disease and ultimately at autopsy. Aside from rare and highly penetrant mutations that cause familial AD,
several genetic factors play a critical role for risk of AD/ADRD. Also, epigenetic markers change throughout the
lifespan and may contribute to AD heterogeneity by potentially providing resistance to pathology or resilience
to clinical progression. The Genetics Core was first funded in 2017 to meet the Penn ADRC’s growing needs of
increasing the genetic characterization of the Penn ADRC Cohort and here we propose to transition from
traditional genetics to a Genomics Core. The Genomics Core will innovatively incorporate genetics and
bioinformatics expertise with the goal of supporting the Penn ADRC mission by providing resources to conduct
and support genomics research in collaboration with the other cores through the following Aims: (1) Extract
nucleic acid from biosamples for biobanking and sharing; (2) Perform genotyping and generate polygenic risk
scores to relate to pathology and downstream processes of AD; (3) Measure DNA methylation and generate
epigenetic summary scores like “epigenetic clock”; (4) Screen and counsel patients for hereditary disease; and
(5) Enhance diversity in research and education of genetics of AD. We will accomplish these Aims by
receiving DNA from Clinical Core subjects through the Biomarker and Neuropathology Cores. DNA banking
efforts will be enhanced by the diversity of subjects in the Penn Aging Brain Cohort (ABC) Study that is
enriched for African Americans and the collaborating Aging Brain Cohort Dedicated to Diversity (ABCD2).
We will closely collaborate with the Data Management and Statistic (DMS) Core to deposit resulting data into
the Integrated Neurodegenerative Disease Database. This will enable collaborating Penn ADRC Cores, and
through data sharing initiatives other internal and external investigators, to perform genetic association studies
of neuroimaging, biofluid biomarkers and clinical progression with the goal of improving our understanding of
the complexities and heterogeneity of AD/ADRD and identifying mechanistic candidates for novel therapies.
Through these activities we will additionally contribute to the Research and Education Component (REC) by
training early career scientists including fellows and junior faculty."
10927235,"SUMMARY
In biomedical research, we are witnessing a fundamental transition from a science focused on the function of
single molecules or pathways to information-rich data science that analyzes biological systems and their
behavior as a whole. This approach, known as Systems Biology, integrates data from all levels of complexity
measured by various high-throughput approaches using advanced computational methods to study how
networks of interacting biological components determine the properties and activities of living systems. With
technological advances over the last decade, the ‘Omics’ technologies such as genomics, epigenetics,
transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, are now incorporated into the everyday methodology of
biological researchers. These high-throughput technologies offer a great opportunity; however, they also pose
great challenges as they rapidly generate large amounts of diverse data and the analysis becomes more
complex. Most biological researchers do not have adequate training in data analysis approaches and
frequently lack access to appropriate databases or software to expedite analysis. Therefore, it is critical to
provide the investigators with high-quality advanced data analysis services as well as training in data analysis
resources to facilitate analysis and interpreting the data.
In this Phase 2 application, we are proposing to establish a new Core, Computational Data Analysis Core
(CDAC), to support the big data analysis needs of the new project leaders and the larger COBRE community.
Three aims are proposed: Aim 1: Establish standardized advanced bioinformatics services for the analysis of
high-throughput Omics data, including but not limited to RNA-Seq, microbiome, and ChIP-Sequencing. Aim 2:
Provide the COBRE and other biomedical researchers with support on comprehensive high-throughput
experimental design, bioinformatics data analysis, technical support, and consultation. Aim 3: Educate faculty,
staff, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students in computational data analysis technologies. Handling of big
data remains a challenge for most investigators, and adequate training in various tools and analysis pipelines
is critically required for users. The Core will develop and offer hands-on training workshops to help
investigators, students, and postdocs to learn the fundamental steps of data analysis. Educational activities of
the Core will thus help our trainees advance their careers by providing them marketable skills in bioinformatics
data analysis. Overall, CDAC will provide dedicated state-of-the-art and accurate high-throughput data analysis
services and training to the investigators, which will significantly enhance the overall research of HPI COBRE."
10927245,"Human giardiasis, caused by the protozoan parasite Giardia duodenalis, is one of the most prevalent enteric
parasitic protozoan infections globally, with prevalence rates ranging from 2-5% in the developed world and 20-
30% in the developing countries. Human infections are initiated by the ingestion of quadrinucleate cysts along
with contaminated food or water and the vegetative forms of the parasite or trophozoites colonize the proximal
portions of the small intestine, especially the duodenum and jejunum. Symptomatic infections in humans are
characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms that may include abdominal cramps, flatulence, diarrhea, nausea,
with a malabsorption syndrome occurring in clinical and subclinical cases and may result in failure to thrive and/or
stunted growth, especially in children. Most cases of human giardiasis are self-limiting and are resolved
spontaneously within weeks following exposure in immunocompetent individuals, indicating the development of
an effective anti-Giardia immunity sufficient for the clearance of G. duodenalis infections in humans. We have
found non-redundant functions for chemokine/chemokine receptor signaling pathways in major intestinal sub-
compartments as well as across the entire intestinal tract. Consistent with the microenvironmental differences
between the small intestine and the colon, the differential expression of bile acids (BAs), as the end-products of
cholesterol catabolism, represents one of the major microenvironmental cues shaping intestinal homeostasis
and inflammation in these two main anatomical sub-compartments. Using a mouse model of human giardiasis,
we will investigate the roles played by the BA in the compartmentalized immune responses along the intestinal
tract. Successful completion of these studies will improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which
immune cells are imprinted and homed to the intestinal sub-compartments and will further provide insights into
the development of novel preventive and therapeutic targets in the context of infections and non-infectious (i.e.
IBD, celiac disease) settings in humans."
10870035,"Neuroimaging Core Project Summary
Because of their tolerability, versatility, and spatial specificity, neuroimaging biomarkers are a prominent
strategy used in AD/ADRD research to detect AD pathology, provide insights into disease mechanism and
heterogeneity, track disease progression and, ultimately, monitor the efficacy of disease-modifying
interventions. Neuroimaging methods can also noninvasively assess other neuropathophysiological
mechanisms such as neurovascular insufficiency and neuroinflammation that are implicated as mechanisms
and modulators of AD and therefore likely contribute to the heterogeneity observed in its risk, incidence, and
progression. When linked to postmortem measures of proteinopathy burden, imaging measures can shed light
on heterogeneity of AD/ADRD, allowing for discovery of in vivo signatures of “pure AD” and concomitant non-
AD pathologies.
The Penn ADRC Neuroimaging Core will consolidate expertise in advanced neuroimaging methods and
applications to support the acquisition and analysis of state-of-the-art multimodal MRI of brain structure and
function, molecular brain imaging using PET, retinal angiography using optical coherence tomography (OCTA).
The Neuroimaging Core will oversee the acquisition and analysis of standard MRI and PET scans used in
defining preclinical AD based on amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (“A/T/(N)”) staging and for quantifying
ischemic lesions in the brain. Additional unique features of the Neuroimaging Core include the use of ultra-
high-field (7T) MRI both in vivo and for post-mortem imaging of intact hemispheres, the development methods
for accurate image-guided sampling of post-mortem brain tissue allowing spatial linkage between digital
pathology and in vivo morphometry, the development a data infrastructure linking imaging and non-imaging
databases, novel MRI and OCT methods for quantifying brain structure and vascular function in ADRC
research, and infrastructure to support the translation of novel PET tracers to clinical research in AD/ADRD.
The Neuroimaging Core will also share imaging data collected at the Penn ADRC with the NACC Coordinating
Center at the University of Washington and SCAN U24.
The Neuroimaging Core will be highly integrated with other ADRC cores, providing access to advanced
imaging and derived imaging metrics for the Clinical Core, collaboration on image analysis and databasing of
image-based information with the Data Management and Statistics Core, linking in vivo and postmortem
neuroimaging to neuropathology in conjunction with the Neuropathology Core, leveraging imaging as a means
of linking genetic factors with structural and functional brain phenotype with Genomics Core, working with the
Outreach Recruitment and Engagement Core to provide research updates about neuroimaging advances and
promote participation in imaging studies, and providing education and training in neuroimaging through
Research Education Component."
10870038,"Research Education Component Summary
The goal of the Research Education Component (REC) is to create a cadre of collaborative scientific leaders in
research on AD/ADRD. Our REC structure uses a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary, diverse and inclusive
approach. We designed our integrated program to assure trainees will acquire a keen appreciation of the
heterogeneity within AD and between it and other neurodegenerative diseases, as well as a comfort with
thinking about how basic findings inform clinical research, and clinical findings inform basic research. With the
REC, the Penn ADRC will implement NAPA milestones to improve and increase cross-disciplinary training,
including for individuals who are members of under-represented populations, and of different career levels of
scholars. The REC is well-integrated with the Clinical, ORE and Admin Cores in order to promote and execute
training opportunities, and with all ADRC Cores to create scholar-specific mentoring and training plans and
develop data and didactics presentations. We will provide training to 4 categories of trainees: (1) fellows who
have completed their residency (MD & MD/PhD), (2) doctoral/postdoctoral trainees, (3) junior faculty (defined
as instructor or early [<3 years] assistant professor, PhD, MD or MD/PhD), and (4) undergraduate and
graduate students from underrepresented minority groups who participate in mentored research experiences
over a summer semester or during a research block. The specific aims of the REC are the following: 1.
Assemble and provide ongoing training to a cadre of Penn faculty who will serve as mentors and instructors to
the REC trainees; 2. Implement a structured methodology to identity trainees spanning fellow/doctoral to junior
faculty levels, and a targeted effort to identify undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented
minority groups; 3. Provide training that includes research design and conduct, the ethical and socially
responsible conduct of research, the value of multi-disciplinary collaborative approaches to research on AD
and related disorders, career planning (including work-life balance, leadership and goal setting), and core
research skills of writing and dissemination; and 4. Use evaluations of the faculty and trainees to revise and
update the Research Education training program, with attention to cultivating the next generation of AD
researchers, diversity and the immediate- and long-term advancement of trainees’ careers."
10841038,"The escalating incidence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) places a tremendous economic
burden on society and families, making up the largest healthcare cost expenditure in the US. To date, medical
approaches for preventing and treating ADRD have yielded limited success. Non-pharmacological preventive
strategies, such as physical activity, hold promise for sustaining cognition and thus reducing ADRD risks in older
adults. Unfortunately, it is not feasible and practical for many older adults to engage in the recommended higher-
intensity physical activities (or aerobic exercise), especially for those with mobility limitations, physical barriers,
and predisposing health conditions. Existing evidence suggests that even engaging in lower-intensity lifestyle
activities, such as walking, may benefit cognitive health. However, this literature has exclusively focused on the
total amount or mean volume of light-intensity physical activity (LPA) or steps and identified small-to-moderate
effects on cognition. Beyond the total volume performed, the day-to-day variability (or stability) of LPA or steps
also represents a behavioral target that potentially can amplify the cognitive benefits, but this variable has not
been tested in the literature. Using an experimental medicine approach, this proposal will bridge the knowledge
gap by determining whether older adults’ daily variability and volume of LPA/steps jointly predict their
proximal and distal cognitive function. This study will recruit ethnically diverse older adults (ages 60+) who
are insufficiently active and have higher risks for developing ADRD. Eligible participants will wear an
accelerometer for 30 days to estimate each person’s typical variability and volume of their daily LPA/steps. They
will complete daily e-surveys during the same 30-day period to assess their daily stress, sleep, and social
engagements. These factors influence older adults’ daily physical activity and cognition, so they will be
considered (modeled) when estimating each person’s typical LPA and step patterns. After the 30-day monitoring
period, participants will complete three follow-up cognitive measures on Day 31, at 2.5 months, and 4 months.
These cognitive measures involve validated in-lab and smartphone-based tools (MoCA, scales, NIH-funded
M2C2 app). Lastly, this study will examine whether subgroup differences (based on demographics) exist in the
proposed associations between daily lifestyle activity patterns (variation and volume of LPA/steps) and cognitive
function. To enhance the rigor of our study findings, we will apply the novel MixWILD statistical program in our
analysis. This program accounts for uncertainties in unbalanced datasets, which can enhance estimation
precision and provide reliable results. The first study aim is to determine if both variation and volume of daily
LPA/steps are joint targets for sustaining proximal and distal cognitive function in older adults at risk for ADRD.
The second aim is to investigate if there are sex, gender, age, and race/ethnicity differences in the associations
between LPA/step patterns and cognitive function. Findings have the potential to identify achievable and scalable
behavioral targets that can be engaged in future efficacy trials to reduce ADRD risks in older adults’ daily lives."
10893623,"Up to 50% of people with HIV (PWH) in the US are food insecure. PWH who are food insecure are
more likely to have lower antiretroviral adherence, decreased viral suppression, and increased incidence of
serious illness. Increasing research suggests that HIV also leads to the development of cardiometabolic
comorbidities, but little is known about how food insecurity (FI) affects the development of these comorbidities
among PWH.
 The objectives of this study are to better understand how FI contributes to the development of
cardiometabolic comorbidities among PWH and to test a novel bilingual FI intervention designed to reduce
these comorbidities among food insecure PWH. We will conduct this study in partnership with the Wake Forest
Infectious Diseases Specialty Clinic, one of the largest Ryan White-funded clinics in North Carolina, which
serves more than 2,000 PWH annually from a predominantly rural catchment area that includes South Central
Appalachia. This area has high rates of both FI and HIV.
 In Aim 1, we will collect longitudinal data from each patient yearly for up to 3 years during their routine
HIV care visits. Using these data, we will compare the prevalence and incidence of cardiometabolic
comorbidities between food secure and insecure PWH. We hypothesize that food insecure PWH will be more
likely to have cardiometabolic comorbidities, including prediabetes and T2DM than food secure PWH at
baseline. We also hypothesize that those who are FI will have a higher incidence of prediabetes and T2DM
than those who are food secure over time. In Aim 2, using a randomized controlled trial design, we will test
weCare/Secure, a refined version of a bilingual evidence-based intervention that integrates peer navigation
and mHealth, to determine the impact of the intervention on insulin sensitivity among food insecure PWH with
prediabetes or T2DM. In Aim 3, we will explore intervention effects though semi-structured individual in-depth
interviews.
 The proposed research complements the RFA’s focus by advancing our understanding of how “FI
impacts the development of comorbidities” among PWH and testing “how interventions for FI alleviate NIDDK-
relevant comorbidities.” This will be one of the first studies to evaluate how FI leads to the development of
cardiometabolic comorbidities among PWH. Additionally, we will test a novel bilingual intervention to improve
insulin sensitivity among PWH by reducing FI. Given the growing interest among health systems in addressing
FI as a routine part of clinical practice, if the intervention is found to be efficacious, it could be broadly
disseminated across HIV clinical care settings. Our team of established investigators has a proven record of
success conducting randomized trials among PWH, has successfully used methods proposed in this
application, and has the full support of the clinical site where the study will occur."
10850922,"Summary
Blinding eye diseases, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, and retinitis pigmentosa cause neuronal
degeneration and lead to severe disability. The restoration of lost neurons using cell transplantation holds
promise, but the degenerating retina may prove resistant to exogenous cell integration as it undergoes
structural remodeling with disease progression. An alternative approach is to use endogenous stem cells for
retinal neuron regeneration. Remarkably, in zebrafish, Müller glia can function as stem cells and regenerate
retinal neurons lost to injury or disease. Although Müller glia are found in both the zebrafish and mammalian
retina, and share structure and function; only in fish do they regenerate new neurons. Over the past decade,
we have learned a lot about the genetic programs and signaling pathways that regulate Müller glia
reprogramming and proliferation in zebrafish; however, we still lack an understanding of why they can mount a
regenerative response in fish, but not in mammals. It seems likely this information resides in Müller glia’s
quiescent state. Interestingly, Notch signaling has recently emerged as an important difference between pro-
regenerative Müller glia in the zebrafish retina and non-regenerative Müller glia in the mammalian retina. In
zebrafish Müller glia, Notch signaling is active in the basal state and must be suppressed for regeneration to
ensue; however, in mice Notch signaling is essentially absent from Müller glia beyond postnatal stages.
Interestingly, Notch signaling is also associated with radial glial stem cells in the brain and its suppression is
necessary for their cell division and neuronal regeneration. Furthermore, Notch signaling can amplify
stochastic events by lateral inhibition and thereby, may drive Müller cell heterogeneity. Zebrafish Müller glia
heterogeneity is suggested by differences in gene expression, spontaneous proliferation, and response to
retinal injury. In this grant we propose to further characterize Müller glia cell heterogeneity in the uninjured
zebrafish retina and connect this heterogeneity to Müller glia’s regenerative potential. In addition, we will
investigate how Notch signaling impacts the Müller glia transcriptome to regulate its regenerative properties. It
is anticipated that these studies will provide new insights into retina regeneration in zebrafish and lead to new
strategies for stimulating Müller glia’s regenerative response in mammals."

Metagenomics sequencing is increasingly becoming important for human microbiome
research. Human microbiomes comprise a rich ecosystem of beneficial and pathogenic
microorganisms and bacteriophages that can influence human health. Yet,
bacteriophages remain poorly studied because most bacteriophages cannot be isolated
in a laboratory. As a result, cultivation-independent omics approaches such as
metagenomics are emerging as important tools for studying bacteriophages directly
from mixed communities. However, a significant challenge in virology is the relative
absence of high-quality bioinformatics tools to enable the study of bacteriophages from
metagenomics data compared to the abundance of such tools available for prokaryotes.
We will develop several novel algorithms to enable the study of bacteriophages and
their ecology from metagenomics data, including for the discovery of novel uncultivated
phages, phage population genomics, phage taxonomy, phage:host and
phage:metabolism interactions, and the dynamics of integrated phages. Our
approaches will be formalized through the development and release of open access
databases and software based on FAIR (Fair, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)
data principles, which will enable investigation of fundamental questions in
bacteriophage ecology governing human health. To demonstrate the utility and wide
applicability of our methods to study bacteriophages, we will apply them on a diverse
group of metagenome data sets from human microbiomes sourced from publicly
available data and several existing collaborations. While our approaches are designed
for the study of bacteriophages from metagenome data, they can also be applied
broadly towards the study of all viruses including RNA phages from metatranscriptomic
data and viruses infecting eukaryotes. Successfully accomplishing this project will
provide scalable bioinformatics approaches that can be widely applied to the study of
bacteriophages from metagenomics data."
10832662,"Colorado has a long and storied history of heterogeneity-related ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis (APS)
research. After the initial Lancet description of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), Colorado
investigators subsequently identified pneumonia and sepsis as diagnoses associated with an increased
susceptibility for ARDS. Since that time, Colorado investigators (including many key personnel on this
proposal) have reported seminal discoveries regarding heterogeneity of ARDS, pneumonia, and sepsis
including identification of a) alcohol use disorders (AUDs) as the first co-morbid conditions that increase
susceptibility to ARDS, b) AUDs deleterious impact on sepsis mortality, c) and sex, racial, and ethnic
differences in ARDS and sepsis epidemiology. Simultaneously, Colorado investigators have been unraveling
the basic mechanisms of APS focusing on heterogeneity in the host inflammatory response. As a higher
proportion of patients began to survive APS, we expanded our research to examine survivorship focusing on
neuromuscular dysfunction. These studies have resulted in enhanced ways to diagnose weakness and
improve our understanding of the neuromuscular trajectory of recovery in APS survivors. We propose to
conduct two clinical center-specific scientific projects demonstrating the breadth and depth of our research that
spans acute APS severity and its recovery trajectory in survivors. The acute project will identify distinct
mononuclear cell endotypes present in the lungs and blood of APS participants with acute respiratory failure
using bulk RNA seq. The recovery project will establish whether neuromuscular endotypes, based primarily on
a single time-point nerve conduction study, can identify distinct and clinically relevant trajectories of recovery.
We will also explore the cross-cutting theme of how AUDs impact APS heterogeneity. Building upon a strong
and persistent research foundation, we have the research infrastructure to achieve all the outlined goals and
are poised to be a strong contributor to the national APS consortium. As an original and integral member of the
ARDS and then PETAL Network (for over 28 consecutive years), our multi-disciplinary and collaborative
research group is experienced in conducting high quality NIH-funded prospective cohort research. In 2021, the
Colorado research group enrolled 554 APS participants into clinical and translational research studies. This
number far exceeds the APS consortium requirement of 240 APS patients per year. We also have extensive
expertise
academic
rural
recruiting historically underrepresented communities (Latinx, Black, and Indigenous) from both
and community hospitals. For this proposal, we will also enroll participants from the often overlooked
community, ensuring their representation in the APS consortium.In summary, the Colorado APS Center
plans to exceed our enrollment obligations; maintain excellence in the quality of protocol compliance, data
acquisition, and regulatory responsibilities; actively contribute to the steering committee and other APS
committees; and most importantly advance science and contribute to improving the care of APS patients."

 Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a specialized type of adipose that is primarily responsible for regulating body
temperature. Once activated by cold, BAT dissipates the chemical energy as heat in a process called adaptive
thermogenesis. Activating and expanding the thermogenic adipose tissue are attractive ways to increase energy
expenditure and offer promising strategies to combat obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. A critical barrier to
harnessing the potential of BAT to enhance cardiometabolic health in humans is the lack of understanding of the
full range of pathways involved in the activation of BAT thermogenesis. Chronic cold exposure stimulates BAT
thermogenesis through the coordinated stimulation of brown adipogenesis, angiogenesis, and sympathetic
innervation. However, how these distinct processes are spatiotemporally coordinated is not known. Using single-
cell transcriptomic analysis of BAT, we have recently identified the network of cellular interactome in the
thermogenic adipose niche. This proposal is built on our recent discovery of Slit guidance ligand 3 (Slit3) as an
essential regulator of BAT thermogenesis through controlling both angiogenesis and sympathetic innervation in
BAT. This proposal examines the mechanisms by which Slit3 fragments stimulate vascular endothelial cells and
sympathetic neurites to promote angiogenesis and sympathetic innervation. We hypothesize that the N-terminal
and C-terminal fragments of Slit3 (Slit3-N and Slit3-C) bind to distinct receptors on endothelial cells and
sympathetic nerves to stimulate angiogenesis and sympathetic innervation. In aim 1, we will use AAV-mediated
gene delivery to overexpress Slit3 fragments in BAT and determine the effects of each fragment on angiogenesis
and sympathetic innervation. In aim 2, we will use a panel of in vitro and in vivo models to identify the specific
receptors responsible for mediating the effects of Slit3 fragments in vascular endothelial cells and sympathetic
nerves. The proposed studies will provide a broad and deep understanding of how Slit3 regulates the two
essential processes involved in BAT thermogenesis, angiogenesis, and sympathetic innervation. These studies
will identify new potential nodes of intervention for obesity and metabolic diseases by stimulating the healthy
expansion of thermogenic fat."

Ensuring that the next generation of cancer researchers is developing not only the skills to perform high-caliber
basic research, but also a deep appreciation for the disease as clinicians see it, is critical for bridging the divide
between bench and bedside. To address this need, we developed the current iteration of our NCI-funded T32,
entering its 25 year, named the Cancer Biology Training Grant (CBTG). The CBTG draws on 50 Case
Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) research mentors to train 3 postdocs and 1 predoc. The Case CCC
is a matrix Cancer Center based at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) linking all cancer-related research
efforts across three institutions: CWRU, University Hospitals (UH), and the Cleveland Clinic (CC). Distinguishing
features of the current CBTG application include: (i) a highly supportive environment, as Case CCC earned an
“Exceptional” rating at its most recent CCSG renewal in 2018; (ii) innovative training program comprised of four
major pillars: Mentored Research, Career Enhancement activities, a Clinical Perspective, and a robust
Curriculum; (iii) Mentors that provide a wealth of opportunities for cancer biology training, interconnected through
programmatic activities across the Center; and (iv) a highly selective trainee pool together with productive
research careers for those appointed to the program. Many activities for appointees are T32-specific/selective,
including robust grant-writing and reviewing experience, mentoring of undergrads in our summer undergraduate
research program (CanSUR), an IDP Dinner with the PD and AD, attendance at Junior Faculty Mentoring
sessions, experience organizing a retreat, and attendance at the Cancer Biology Training Consortium
(CABTRAC) annual meeting. Clinical Perspective elements include a Case CCC Bench-to-Bedside Retreat,
monthly Cancer Biology Trainees’ Seminar Series (with clinical fellows and K12 faculty), attendance at an
Interdisciplinary Tumor Board, Clinical Case Report presentations to undergrads, and shadowing of physician-
scientists. Taken together, training in the CBTG will provide the fundamental skills necessary for outstanding
careers in biomedical cancer research, together with a deep appreciation of the challenges and complexity of
cancer in the clinical setting."

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is now a widely established and indispensable method for determining the
high-resolution structures of biomedically important molecules. Given that thousands of images, often acquired
over the course of several days, are required to obtain such structures, automation software has played a critical
role in the large-scale adoption of this method by the scientific community. In just the past five years, cryo-EM
has revolutionized our understanding of entire biological systems, and in 2020 provided the first molecular
descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 interaction with neutralizing antibodies. The widespread adoption of cryo-EM
recently prompted the NIH to invest in three National Centers through the Transformative High Resolution Cryo-
Electron Microscopy Program, providing free, high-end electron microscope access to biologists across the
country. The exponential increase in the popularity of cryo-EM has led to an astonishing number of developments
in sample preparation methodologies and image processing algorithms, which have improved attainable
resolution of single particle reconstructions. However, comparatively little progress has been made in optimizing
the quality of the cryo-EM data being collected. The pioneering software packages Leginon and Appion
demonstrated the power of automated data acquisition and real-time processing (respectively), and there are
now numerous programs for automated data acquisition and real-time processing. Despite advances in
automation, optimally extracting the highest quality data from an EM sample still requires manual involvement of
an expert electron microscopist. User intervention and expertise is necessary to run the appropriate image
analyses, interpret the results, and make informed decisions on how the processed results relate to the ongoing
data collection. However, even experts must content with the fact that the “best grid regions” differ drastically
from sample to sample, and there are no established tools for automatically and quickly assessing the quality of
the specimen across the various microenvironments of an EM grid. Given the ever-increasing incorporation of
cryo-EM into labs’ research programs, it is imperative that data collection and processing be streamlined to
match the growing needs of the structural community. We propose to develop a second generation
Leginon/Appion software package, “Magellon”, to overcome existing bottlenecks and provide an avenue toward
fully automated data acquisition that bypasses need for user input during data collection. Importantly, this
software will support the computational infrastructure to enable real-time image processing results to inform on
and modify the ongoing data collection regime by learning where to acquire images in regions that will yield the
highest resolution structures. We will develop and incorporate new, fast image assessment routines, while also
providing an application programming interface to enable the incorporation of extensions and plugins from
developers in the community. Further, Magellon will enable straightforward, seamless import and export of data
from its database to accommodate remote data acquisition at any of the regional or national cryo-EM centers."

Polymicrobial communities are ubiquitous in the human body and their behaviors are critical drivers of both
health and disease. Bacteria are social organisms; thus, the behavior of the group is driven not only by the
composition of the community, but also by interactions between the constituents and their surrounding
environment. A key principle shared among all communities, is that space matters. Groups organize to maximize
acquisition of goods, minimize exposure to toxic compounds, and optimize communication. Our recent data
reveal bacteria can communicate with members of distant species and respond by changing how they spatially
structure their communities. My laboratory seeks to understand how bacteria communicate between species by
observing them in their native environment, tracking their movements, and listening to and decoding their
languages.
We utilize Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the most notoriously problematic opportunistic pathogen in multiple types
of polymicrobial infections, including chronic wounds and lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. We
recently reported that P. aeruginosa establishes infections with other important pathogens in the lungs of patients
with CF for decades, remaining unresponsive to intense antibiotic therapies and causing lung decline and early
death.
In this proposal, we begin by visualizing the spatial landscape of polymicrobial communities in situ, in
transplanted lungs from CF patients and animal models of polymicrobial infection. By combining next-generation
tissue clearing and fluorescent in situ hybridization, we are able to visualize the spatial positioning of species on
a range of spatial scales, in relation to each other and host structures. This will yield an unprecedented view of
microbes during infection and provide a platform for visualizing communities in other organs rich in polymicrobial
communities, such as the gastrointestinal tract.
Next, we will systematically decode the interspecies signaling language. We designed high-throughput screens
to identify genes necessary for signaling and the repertoire of signaling molecules. Using live-imaging techniques
pioneered by my lab, we visualize and track the movement of bacterial cells, gene expression, and dynamics of
motility appendages, upon modulation of the identified pathways. Initial studies reveal P. aeruginosa responds
by activating multiple signaling systems, which tune the direction of movement and activate virulence systems.
Collectively, these studies will construct a comprehensive picture of interspecies communication and enlighten
how interactions exacerbate disease."

A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their ability to migrate, divide, adhere and respond to environmental cues.
Nonmuscle myosin-2 (NM2) motors play an essential role in many aspects of these fundamental cellular
processes by forming short bipolar filaments that interact with actin filaments. NM2 motors are binary switches
that alter between inactive and active states depending on the cellular context. The precise control of NM2 motor
activity is critical for its cellular function as master regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. Aberrant regulation due to
mutations in NM2 paralogs contribute to a whole host of diseases including blood and neurological disorders,
heart diseases, deafness, nephritis, and cancers. NM2-specific therapies are thus needed, yet the lack of basic
knowledge about the structure and regulation of NM2 paralogs is a bottleneck to their development. We aim to
develop a detailed structural and mechanistic understanding of how force generation by NM2 motors drive
various cellular functions. Using innovative and interdisciplinary techniques including the state-of-the-art cryo-
electron microscopy, X-ray crystallography, steady-state kinetics, in vitro motility assays and high-resolution
fluorescence microscopy, we will systematically dissect the mechanisms of activation and regulation of NM2. To
achieve this, in Aim 1, we will determine the major structural states in the ATPase cycle of NM2 motors to explain
enzyme function. In Aim 2, we will determine a high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the inactive state of full-
length NM2 to explain its molecular architecture. In Aim 3, we will study the consequences of abolishing the
ability to form an inactive state on the dynamics of NM2 filaments in cells. Collectively, our studies will provide a
deeper understanding of the structure, function and regulation of NM2. Importantly, this knowledge will advance
our understanding of emergent NM2 functions in cells and thus, lay the foundation for future development of
NM2-specific therapeutics."
10854811,"Skeletal muscle has remarkable capacity for regeneration. This capability derives from resident muscle stem
cells, called satellite cells (SCs). During adult muscle homeostasis, SCs are quiescent. Upon injury, they are
“activated” to generate myoblasts for muscle repair. SCs are localized between myofibers and their surround-
ding basal lamina; this niche promotes SC quiescence. Proper regulation of quiescence is necessary for long-
term SC function and for successful engraftment of SCs. Therefore, knowledge of how the niche promotes
quiescence is critical to harnessing SCs for therapeutic purposes. However, the mechanisms that underlie SC
quiescence and the quiescence-to-activation (Q-to-A) transition remain poorly understood. In uninjured
muscles in vivo, SCs have long projections. Little is known of these structures, as they are lost during prepara-
tion of SCs for study in vitro. We have developed a single myofiber isolation procedure that allows mainten-
ance of projections. QSC projections are microtubule (MT)-rich and ringed with cortical F-actin, resembling
neuronal axons. Our findings indicate that SC projections are motile, potentially allowing QSCs to scan the
surface of the myofiber for damage and/or signals that regulate quiescence vs. activation. Retraction of project-
tions occurs upon SC activation and is a very early step in the Q-to-A transition, preceding other known early
steps. Cadherins, which are required for quiescence and regulate the Q-to-A transition, are important factors
for maintenance of projections. We hypothesize that SC quiescence is a dynamic state, characterized by
motile projections regulated by cadherins and the cytoskeleton. We have identified novel factors as candidate
regulators of this process, including the GTPase, Rac1; the MT minus-end binding protein, CAMSAP3; and the
RhoA GEF, LFC. We will test our hypotheses with a combination of genetic studies in mice and cell biological
studies with single myofiber preparations. The following aims are proposed: 1) to determine the roles of Rac1,
CAMSAP3, and LFC on SC quiescence and Q-to-A transition, we will construct mice conditionally lacking
these factors in adult SCs and assess SC homeostasis, function, and structure in vivo and on single myofibers
prepared with our new methods; and 2) to investigate cytoskeletal dynamics of retracting SC projections during
the Q-to-A transition, we will adapt live imaging protocols to our single myofiber preparations. Mice with SC-
specific expression of fluorescent probes for F-actin and MT dynamics will be employed with time-lapse micro-
scopy. The effects of perturbing cadherins, the cytoskeleton, and specific signaling proteins on this initial step
of SC activation will be determined. The ability to exploit SCs in muscle therapies requires detailed molecular
and cell biological knowledge of SC quiescence and the Q-to-A transition, but they are poorly understood. The
proposed aims are highly novel and involve a synergistic combination of genetic and cell biological analyses.
They are expected to provide fundamental new information on SC biology. They are therefore anticipated to
have a significant impact on the potential use of SCs as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine."

Funds are requested for competitive renewal of a predoctoral “Emerging and Tropical Infectious Diseases”
Training Program to support four trainees. Training is provided by 21 Program faculty members. Emerging and
tropical infectious diseases encompass the broad-based multidisciplinary basic sciences, as well as field-related
sciences (ecology, entomology, epidemiology, vertebrate zoology), with this program focusing on “vector-borne
diseases.” The University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston has made a major commitment to
emerging and tropical diseases, including the development of the Galveston National Laboratory, Institute for
Human Infections and Immunity, Sealy Institute for Vaccine Sciences, and Center for Tropical Diseases. These
entities provide trainees of this program with a highly attractive array of research areas greatly relevant to
emerging and tropical infectious diseases. In addition, students can undertake epidemiology studies overseas
and internships at the World Health Organization sites. Therefore, the trainees will have opportunities to
undertake a variety of potential research topics from laboratory-based studies at UTMB to field studies in local
and oversea sites. The multidisciplinary program involves trainees from five graduate programs: Biochemistry &
Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Experimental Pathology, Microbiology & Immunology, and Human
Pathophysiology & Translational Medicine. Formal course work is completed in the first two years, affording the
trainee with a comprehensive background in infectious disease concepts. Laboratory rotations familiarize the
students with state-of-the-art technology and facilities and orient them to potential future mentors. The students
select mentors during the first and early part of the second year and prepare and defend a research dissertation
topic in consultation with a research committee. The research is then conducted, culminating in the dissertation
and defense. The predoctoral trainees have access to state-of-the-art facilities at UTMB, including arthropod
containment level (ACL)-2, ACL3, BSL3, and animal BSL3 and BSL4. They participate in multiple research
seminar series, including the “Infectious Diseases & Immunity Colloquium,” and they present their own research
results in the graduate program Research-in-Progress seminar series. The Program’s high caliber, NIH-funded
training faculty have years of mentoring experience with trainees that publish multiple papers in scientific
journals. Importantly, this T32 also provides opportunities for junior (associate members) faculty to be mentored
by senior training faculty members. Most of the former trainees embark on postdoctoral fellowships and assume
positions of responsibility at medical and graduate schools, colleges, and as staff of research institutes and
industry. Overall, this training program has integrated well with local research and education programs and
prepared our trainees for emerging and vector-borne infectious disease challenges."

The epigenetic machinery is essential for mammalian development, and components of this machinery are
mutated in a variety of human diseases. Hundreds of regulatory proteins participate in the reading, writing, and
erasing of epigenetic information over the lifespan of an organism. However, the in vivo activity of many of these
epigenetic regulators remain inadequately characterized. Here, we leverage IMPC-generated mouse lines
lacking epigenetic regulators, together with recent advances in single-cell epigenomic and transcriptomic
technologies, to interrogate components of the epigenetic machinery in vivo at the molecular level, and with the
cell-type resolution necessary to understand their complex roles in development and disease. The data produced
here will reveal gene regulatory defects caused by loss of epigenetic regulators in a diverse panel of tissues and
cell types relevant to human congenital malformations. This tissue- and cell-type-resolved view of the effects of
mutations in the epigenetic machinery is a critical step in larger efforts to reveal mechanisms of epigenetically-
influenced disease risk, interpret non-coding sequence variation, and ultimately to tailor diagnostics and
therapeutics to the epigenomic and transcriptomic states of a patient’s disease-contributing cells."

Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive bacterium responsible for more hospital-acquired
infections than any other pathogen. C. difficile infection (CDI) manifests in a range of severity
from diarrheal illness to death, especially in advanced aged patients. Current therapy for CDI
largely relies on antibiotics and, while effective short term, greatly increases the risk for
recurrent infection. To address this issue, we look to identify immunomodulatory approaches
that spare the protective gut microbial communities. In this proposal I will interrogate the role of
IL-6 in CDI disease progression. In preliminary experiments, we found that neutralizing IL-6
worsened disease symptoms in our CDI murine model, suggesting a protective role for IL-6 in
CDI. Further, we found that transcription of a neurotransmitter receptor and positive regulator of
IL-6, the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor(a2ar), is decreased in severe CDI as compared to mild
CDI. Norepinephrine and epinephrine can bind a2ar in immune cells to increase their production
of IL-6. Released IL-6 can act through two signaling pathways: trans-signaling and classical
signaling. IL-6 trans-signaling typically causes pro-inflammatory effects while classical signaling
tends to have anti-inflammatory, regenerative effects. We hypothesize that IL-6 acts through
classical signaling to induce epithelial regeneration and, in turn, decrease disease severity in
CDI. To test this hypothesis, I will use a murine model of CDI. In Aim 1 I will investigate the role
of IL-6 and determine if classical or trans-signaling pathways dictate the effect of IL-6 by
monitoring disease severity and inflammatory profile in models deficient in IL-6 activity or
stimulated or deficient in trans-signaling. In Aim 2, I will identify the primary cellular source of
IL-6 during CDI and determine whether IL-6 production is regulated by catecholamines
norepinephrine and epinephrine in this context. Together, these data will allow us to consider
the signaling axes and cellular determinants that are potentially targetable in CDI. This work not
only has implications for CDI therapy but more broadly, it will allow us to understand the
contributing factors to the pleiotropic role of IL-6 in the gut."

Fungal contamination is common in urban homes and disproportionately affects lower-income families who
have less control over conditions that cause mold growth. The Institute of Medicine, the World Health
Organization and several meta-analyses have established that fungi and home dampness are associated with
asthma symptoms. These findings and those of some successful intervention studies have led to the
conclusion that there is sufficient evidence to recommend dampness and mold remediation to reduce asthma
symptoms. However, the root causes of mold growth, especially in lower-income urban homes are often costly
to fix and, therefore, go unaddressed. New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) has 302 public housing
developments with 2,252 buildings and more than 365,000 residents. Children and adults living in NYCHA
housing have a high burden of asthma morbidity, and complaints of mold and water damage in NYCHA homes
have been common. In 2019, NYCHA implemented ‘Mold Busters’, an innovative new program to effectively
remediate mold in NYC’s public housing using better tools of assessment, enhanced staff training, new
accountability procedures for quality assurance and a streamlined prioritization response system. The
expectation is that this will substantially reduce mold exposure and decrease asthma exacerbations for
NYCHA residents, specifically mold-allergic individuals. Demonstrating improved asthma outcomes resulting
from this policy intervention would have a substantial public health impact. This project will bring together
NYCHA, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), a community organization that
provides asthma interventions in low-income housing and academic researchers to demonstrate improved
resident health associated with this large-scale intervention by linking NYCHA data on mold work orders (which
result from resident complaints), NYC DOHMH data on NYC emergency department (ED) visits for asthma,
public school data on asthma prevalence, and additional data collected by academic and community
researchers on a subset of children living in NYCHA housing. It will also address limitations of previous
studies that lacked adequate measurement of fungi growing in homes and indicators of current fungal
growth/activity, both of which can now be assessed with contemporary gene sequencing methods that may
provide new insight into the spectrum of fungal bioaerosols that asthmatic children and adults are exposed to
indoors. This proposal will test the hypotheses that this large-scale intervention will lead to a decrease in
pediatric and adult asthma morbidity for residents and decreases in allergic fungal species in NYCHA homes
using administrative data on pediatric and adult asthma ED visits and mold work orders in NYCHA homes and
by assessing fungal exposure, allergic sensitization, and asthma morbidity in a sample of asthmatic children
living in NYCHA housing. If successful, this project will demonstrate the utility of a large-scale public health
intervention on asthma morbidity among low-income NYC residents, a community with a high asthma burden."
10868766,"The proposed study will examine the extent to which, among Hispanic youth, the effects of culturally related
stressors on alcohol/drug use and conduct problems are mediated by physiological stress responses. Prior
work has established the psychosocial and biological pathways through which physiological stress responses
potentiate alcohol/drug use and conduct problems. What is not known is the extent to which cultural stressors,
over and above other sources of stress, predict physiological stress responses, and whether cultural stressors
exert an indirect effect on alcohol/drug use and conduct problems through physiological stress responses. This
question is important for prevention science because few interventions have been developed to offset the
effects of cultural stressors, and our results will provide essential information regarding whether such
interventions are needed – as well as the protective mechanisms on which such interventions should focus.
We propose a 3-year accelerated longitudinal cohort study with two cohorts, one beginning in the seventh
grade and one beginning in the ninth grade, to carry out the study aims and to test the study hypotheses. An
accelerated longitudinal design includes multiple age cohorts, where each cohort starts at a different age and
each is followed for the same amount of time. Such a design allows us to examine five years of development
through only three years of data collection. We will recruit and follow 300 Hispanic 7th and 9th graders in Los
Angeles and Miami-Dade counties. Adolescents will be followed for 3 years and assessed at both macro
(longer measures administered every 6 months) and micro (daily measurement bursts using shorter measures
and saliva sample collection for cortisol assays). We will examine the moderating effects of three evidence-
based protective mechanisms – family functioning, life skills, cultural assets, and ethnic socialization – on the
direct and mediated effects of cultural stress on physiological stress responses and on alcohol/drug use and
conduct problems. These moderation and moderated mediation analyses will indicate the specific mechanisms
that should be targeted within prevention programs. This information is critical to decreasing disparities in
conduct problems and alcohol/drug use among Hispanic adolescents."

The US is in the midst of a maternal health crisis. The US has worse maternal mortality (MM) than any
other high-income country and is the only one for which the rate is increasing. Severe maternal morbidity
(SMM), which encompasses conditions that put pregnant women most at risk of dying, doubled in the last
two decades. Women of color, especially Black and Native American women, are at 2-3-fold or greater
increased risk of these outcomes. This proposal focuses on SMM, as a sentinel outcome leading to MM,
yet 100 times more common. Most prior research on SMM has focused on proximal clinical factors
(primarily related to co-morbidities and obstetric management); these factors alone are insufficient for
explaining SMM or its racial/ethnic disparities. The objectives of this proposal are: 1) develop a causal
pathway framework to understand how social determinants and more proximal health-related factors
together contribute to SMM risk and disparities, and 2) use this framework to identify actionable strategies
to reverse current trends and eliminate inequities. We will create a unique dataset that harmonizes 4
years of data from 6 states on 4.4 million births and 66,000 women with SMM. These states collectively
include 1 in 4 US births and sufficiently diverse social environments to disentangle complex multi-level drivers
of maternal health inequity. Our focus is on social determinants from 4 specific domains: socioeconomic
disadvantage, structural inequality, community resources, and health care access, characterized at the
county, neighborhood (census tract or ZIP code), and individual level. Health-related intermediaries
include birth hospital quality of care, mode of birth, and maternal morbidities (eg, hypertension, anemia).
These domains and intermediaries were selected for their relevance to racial/ethnic disparities in
maternal health. In addition, we will evaluate impacts of 3 Quality Improvement (QI) collaboratives on
SMM disparities, which were designed to improve specific aspects of hospital quality of care and
implemented by state-wide perinatal quality collaboratives (PQCs) in 3 of the 6 states included in this
proposal. Our Specific Aims are: 1) Assess the relative and joint contributions of multi-level social
determinants to SMM and SMM disparities; 2) Identify potential health-related mechanisms by which
multi-level social determinants affect SMM and SMM disparities by conducting causal pathway analyses;
and 3) Evaluate the impact of 3 QI collaboratives designed to reduce SMM, on racial/ethnic disparities in SMM
(3a), and apply the causal framework developed in Aims 1 and 2 to these state-specific contexts, to identify
state-specific strategies for addressing SMM disparities (3b). We currently have very limited understanding of
how social determinants contribute to SMM or its disparities. The proposed research will fill this important
knowledge gap, which is an essential part of realizing sustainable improvement of maternal health and
elimination of racial/ethnic disparities."

In the US alone, asthma affects approximately 24 million individuals, 6 million of whom are children under the
age of 18, and is responsible for over 3,000 deaths annually1,2. A population of immune cells, called group 2
innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s), are integral in driving lung inflammatory diseases including asthma through
production of type 2 cytokines in response to tissue `alarmin' cytokine signals. Despite these advances on ILC2
function, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the intracellular pathways that control this pathologic
capacity within pro-inflammatory ILC2s. In new preliminary studies, we uncovered a novel link between
intracellular changes in the structural morphology of ILC2 mitochondria and the pro-inflammatory capacity
within these cells that results in lung airway inflammation. We found that upon exposure to lung tissue
inflammatory signals, ILC2s increased mitochondrial mass and remodeled their mitochondrial morphology
network from a state of elongated `fusion' to fragmented `fission'. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of
fission during a murine model of papain allergen exposure strongly curtailed ILC2 responses and altered their
metabolic programming, thereby resulting in protection from severe lung inflammation. However, despite these
advances, fundamental gaps in knowledge remain about 1) how remodeling of mitochondrial network
morphology affects ILC2-intrinsic airway inflammation and 2) the identification of the metabolic mechanisms by
which mitochondrial dynamics control ILC2 pro-inflammatory function. Here I propose two Aims consisting of
cutting-edge techniques in cellular metabolism and immunobiology to dissect the role of mitochondrial
morphology dynamics in controlling ILC2 metabolic programming and pathological function during murine and
human allergic airway inflammation."

Healthy adipose tissue expansion is necessary for maintaining metabolic health in the setting of over-nutrition –
a situation that is increasingly relevant in the US, as the incidence of obesity is estimated at 33% of the US
population. Therefore, elucidating the fundamental nutrient sensing mechanisms that regulate adipocyte
expansion is critical for understanding, and ultimately treating, the negative metabolic consequences of obesity.
We previously identified Leucine Rich Repeat Containing 8A (LRRC8a or SWELL1), a newly discovered
essential component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC), as a novel volume-sensing regulator of
both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. We and others find that SWELL1 activity and protein expression is
reduced in metabolically unhealthy obese mice and humans – suggesting that reduced multi-organ SWELL1
activity/expression contributes to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome. Our group has biochemical, patch-
clamp and imaging evidence that SWELL1 channel complexes are also expressed and functional in
lysosomes. Given that lysosomes are signaling hubs that integrate nutrient sensing and AKT-mTOR signaling,
we hypothesize that lysosomal SWELL1-LRRC8 channels participate in cellular nutrient sensing by
activating in response to increases in intraluminal lysosomal leucine, and that this signaling mechanism
is dysregulated in the setting of obesity-induced diabetes and insulin resistance. To test this hypothesis,
we combine unique reagents and innovative methods from the Diwan (lysosomal signaling), Xu (lysosomal
patch-clamp), and Held (mass spectrometry) laboratories, with our expertise in SWELL1 signaling, and access
to human adipose tissue samples from highly phenotyped metabolically healthy and unhealthy humans (Klein
laboratory). Our objective is to understand the mechanisms of plasma membrane and lysosomal SWELL1 (Lyso-
SWELL1) nutrient sensing and how it is dysregulated in disease states, including obesity-induced glucose
intolerance and insulin resistance. The rationale for these studies is that delineating the contribution of SWELL1
 to lysosomal nutrient sensing and mTORC1 activation will advance our understanding of a fundamental cellular
 signaling mechanism and guide innovative therapeutic approaches for patients with prediabetes and diabetes.
 We propose the following AIMs:
· AIM#1: Delineate the mechanisms of plasma membrane versus lysosomal SWELL1 signaling to AKT-
 AMPK-mTOR signaling in adipocytes
· AIM#2: Examine the contribution of SWELL1 signaling in vivo in the setting of obesity in mice and
humans
The knowledge gained from these studies will delineate a novel lysosomal ion channel signaling pathway that
regulates adipocyte growth and systemic dysglycemia in obesity, and inform therapeutic strategies currently
underway to modulate SWELL1 signaling for the treatment of obesity-induced metabolic syndrome."
10837110,"Alzheimer’s Disease [AD] is a progressive degenerative disorder of unclear etiology and disease-modifying
treatments remain elusive. Abnormal neurovascular regulation can lead to reduced substrate supply to brain,
including capillary and small vessel pericyte regulation with neuronal activity, conduction from small vessels to
larger scale vessels, and hemodynamic responses to neuronal activity. Neurovascular regulation mechanisms
in the context of the aging brain can be differentiated from the premature aging and progressive
neurodegeneration associated with AD and dementia syndrome. Early pathological neurovascular and
metabolic alterations can reduce substrate delivery to the AD brain. Though brain metabolism is altered during
aging, AD demonstrates more severe and premature metabolic insufficiency in comparison to age-matched
controls, attributable to neurovascular dysregulation at multiple levels.
We will analyze mechanisms of neurovascular regulation occurring in age-matched control genotypes (both
wildtype C57Bl/6 and mNOS2-/-) compared to the progressive degeneration noted in the CVN-AD animal
model of Alzheimer’s disease (APPSwDI +/+ mNos2−/−). This unique mouse model closely mirrors human
phenotypic changes, particularly amyloid plaques around blood vessels, phosphorylated tau, and severe
neurodegeneration. Our hypothesis is that degeneration, as noted in both human AD and the relevant CVN-AD
animal model, is worsened by premature aging changes in substrate supply at the capillary, pericyte,
conduction, and hemodynamic levels. Metabolic insufficiency can arise particularly from abnormal
neurovascular coupling and conduction from small to larger vessels, blunting the hemodynamic response to
dynamic neuronal activity. The CVN-AD model mirrors human AD phenotypes with a predictable time course of
behavioral, vascular and circuit degeneration in relation to aging changes hence provides an appropriate pre-
clinical, translational model for analyzing these concepts. We will study novel approaches to evaluating
mechanisms of neurovascular regulation including chemogenetic approaches at the pericyte, mural wall cell
level, assessing activity and conduction to larger capacity cerebral vessels, neurovascular coupling and
hemodynamic responses, to understand dynamic mechanisms of hypoperfusion at critical times of substrate
need, in both hippocampus and neocortex as a function of genotype, gender, and age."

Celiac disease (CeD) is mediated by abnormal immune responses to gluten antigens found in wheat, barley,
and rye and has an estimated prevalence of 1% in the general US population. Normally, tolerogenic dendritic
cells (DCs) sample dietary antigens from the intestinal lumen and are central in establishing and maintaining oral
tolerance. In persons with CeD the suppression of gluten-specific immune responses is impaired (loss of oral
tolerance (LOT)). LOT is characterized by dampened regulatory T cell (Treg) responses, resulting in
inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) immune responses against gluten in genetically susceptible individuals expressing
the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DQ2 or DQ8 alleles. The Th1 response against gluten is central to CeD
pathogenesis and precedes the development of villous atrophy, the pathological hallmark of CeD. HLA DQ2 or
DQ8 increases the risk of CeD and is required for CeD development, but neither is sufficient. Epidemiological
and immunological observations support a role for additional genetic and environmental factors in CeD
pathogenesis. In line with this hypothesis, we and others have discovered that both, interleukin-15 (IL-15)
overexpression in the intestine and enteric virus infections promote LOT to gluten by inducing a proinflammatory
program in otherwise tolerogenic DCs, which in turn triggers adverse inflammatory Th1 responses to gluten in
CeD-relevant mouse models. One promising strategy to promote oral tolerance and to prevent or revert LOT in
CeD is to use the immunoregulatory potential of commensal gut microbes. The planned research is based on a
novel phenomenon that we just learned from host-protist interactions: commensal gut colonizing protists of the
order Parabasalia promote tolerogenic mucosal immune responses to dietary antigens, resulting in the
prevention of virus-induced LOT. We hypothesize that gut Parabasalia promote oral tolerance to dietary gluten,
prevent LOT and revert LOT to gluten in CeD mouse models by directly modulating dietary-antigen presenting
CD103+ DCs. We further posit that individuals colonized with Parabasalia have decreased risk of developing
CeD. These are all original concepts in the field of CeD. The technical innovation in this proposal stems from:
well-defined and highly relevant humanized CeD mouse models, new approaches to study human gut colonizing
Parabasalia in oral tolerance, and cutting-edge next-generation sequencing tools to determine Parabasalia-
induced functional changes in CD103+ DCs to delineate the mechanism of how Parabasalia promote oral
tolerance and protect from LOT to gluten in CeD. Taken together, we will use conceptually and technically
innovative studies to gain novel insights into how gut Parabasalia promote oral tolerance and prevent/revert LOT
to gluten in CeD. Furthermore, this study will motivate the design of novel Parabasalia-based therapies to prevent
LOT to gluten in individuals at-risk for developing CeD and to re-establish oral tolerance to gluten and thus
ultimately has the potential to impact fields of immunology and cell biology fundamentally."

Many individuals with monogenic and idiopathic forms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit brain
enlargement early in life. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to early brain
overgrowth in ASD are unknown. To identify the mechanisms leading to brain overgrowth, we will use an
appropriate model system, iPSC-derived organoids, from a well-powered, deeply phenotyped cohort with
multiple control groups, the Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS). IBIS is the largest longitudinal neuroimaging study
of infants (>250 participants) at high familial risk for autism by virtue of having an older sibling/proband with ASD.
Importantly, IBIS participants have previously undergone longitudinal neuroimaging at multiple time points in
infancy (between 6-24 months of age) and school age, extensive behavioral assessments at these time points,
as well as rare and common variant genotyping. The extensive phenotypic data generated in this cohort make it
an ideal population from which to generate iPSC-derived organoid models and relate in vitro phenotypes to in
vivo brain growth and behavioral trajectories. Our study also represents a unique opportunity to evaluate how
well organoid phenotypes model the in vivo brain growth trajectories of the individual from whom they were
derived. In this proposal, we will derive and validate iPSCs from blood for participants from high risk families who
developed ASD (HR+), high risk participants who did not develop ASD (HR-), and low risk individuals without
ASD (LR-) totaling 99 participants. We will differentiate the iPSC lines to cortical organoids to model inter-
individual differences in brain development. We will use single cell (sc)RNA-seq to identify cell types, cell cycle
states, and differentiation trajectories in each participant-derived organoid across two time points modeling the
period of cortical neurogenesis, totaling 2.38M sequenced cells. We will validate cell type counts and states
using tissue clearing followed by lightsheet microscopy of the cortical organoids. We will identify cell types, fate
decisions, and cell cycle states that correlate with both cross-sectional and longitudinal cortical surface area
growth and ASD symptoms and cognitive ability over time. Leveraging this unique, deeply characterized clinical
cohort, we will determine both the in vivo relevance of cortical organoids and the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying brain overgrowth in ASD."
10839470,"Viral tropism, or the range of cells, tissues, or species that a virus can infect, is an important concept to understand viral pathogenesis and the emergence of new viral diseases. Noroviruses are the leading cause of diarrheal diseases worldwide, yet little is known about what contributes to norovirus tropism. Filling in this knowledge gap is crucial to better comprehend norovirus biology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic options. Human noroviruses do not robustly replicate in small animal models and thus murine norovirus (MNV) has emerged as a model system to discover mechanisms of norovirus biology and tropism. Over the past several years, it has been established that MNV strains can infect different cells and tissues in mice despite similar routes of inoculation. The molecular basis for these tropism differences are largely unknown. We recently demonstrated that CD300lf is a universal MNV receptor. This finding demonstrates that the primary mechanism for diversifying MNV strain tropism is not differential receptor utilization. These findings suggest the possibility that unknown host antiviral proteins function as restriction factors that limit the tissue and cellular replication of certain MNV strains. Yet, restriction factors for any norovirus have defied molecular identification. Here, we build upon our initial identification of Trim7 and Trim47 as MNV restriction factors. TRIM proteins are ubiquitin E3 ligases, although the substrates and antiviral mechanisms of Trim7 and Trim47 are currently unknown. While Trim7 broadly inhibits MNV strains from replicating, Trim47 selectively inhibits certain MNV strains. In other viral systems, TRIM proteins are responsible for shaping the cellular and species tropism of viruses. Therefore, we hypothesize that Trim7 and Trim47 constitute a family of TRIM restriction factors that regulate the tropism of noroviruses, including human norovirus. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the molecular mechanism of Trim7 and Trim47 inhibition of MNV. We will also determine the breadth of the antiviral activity of Trim7 and Trim47 on related viruses, including human norovirus. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the physiological role of Trim7 and Trim47 in shaping the cells and tissues that are permissive for MNV replication in vivo. We will also determine the in vivo fitness tradeoffs for viruses that acquire resistance to Trim7 and Trim47 .This project leverages the MNV model system to uncover new mechanisms of viral restriction by a pair of poorly understood TRIM proteins. It will provide insight into drivers of norovirus tropism and evolution."
10814834,"Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is the leading cause of newborn death and disability
worldwide and presents clinically as neonatal encephalopathy that is difficult to classify within a
short window after birth to inform neuroprotective interventions. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH)
has dramatically improved outcomes in moderate to severe HIE when initiated within six hours of
life (HOL), yet trials have not included mild HIE. The difficulties to discern the clinical severity
shortly after birth and to analyze the dynamic circulation in sick newborns represent important
challenges. As new trials are now considered to target unstudied mild HIE, neurophysiological
and neuroimaging biomarkers are critically needed 1) to guide real-time patient selection within a
short therapeutic window and 2) to provide insight into timing of the metabolic energy failure and
effect on structural and functional brain outcomes. Our team pioneered a “wavelet neurovascular
bundle” analytical system to measure neurovascular coupling (NVC) under dynamic conditions
and in real time, and to measure regional oxygen consumption one step further into the core of
brain energy homeostasis. The parent grant initially focused on infants with moderate to severe
HIE during the 72 hours of treatment and resulted in twenty six new publications. The overarching
goal of this renewal is to harness our novel physiological biomarkers to focus on untreated mild
HIE to identify those who need treatment. Our objective is to test dynamic biomarkers that can
predict structural and functional outcomes chosen with input from stakeholders, and inform
physiological and metabolic disturbances specific to mild HIE. We plan to enroll a new cohort of
100 neonates with mild HIE (35 per year over 3 years) and to follow up for two years infants for
developmental outcomes. Our infrastructure ensures the success of this proposal and includes a
multidisciplinary team of experts in hemodynamics and electrophysiology signals (Chalak,
Zhang), bioengineering (Liu), and neuroimaging (Liu P, Wisnowski). The high-volume, supportive
research environment at Parkland Hospital, including a 3T Siemens Skyra located inside the
NICU, permits imaging of sick newborns as early as the first day of life. New knowledge will
specifically provide: 1) Development and optimization of neuroimaging and neurophysiological
assessments of mild HIE; and 2) improved HIE stratification via multi-modal assessments.
Impact. The ability to monitor global neurovascular functions in real time could lead to a paradigm
shift by providing the field with sensitive physiological biomarkers to detect the evolution of deficits
in mild HIE and allow targeted interventions in this unstudied population. Engaging community
stakeholders ensures that the NIH mission remains aligned with the priorities of affected families."
10887503,"Project Summary
The need for efficient methods for the production of well-defined oligosaccharides continues to present a major
bottleneck in the field of microbial glycobiology. Although automated oligosaccharide synthesizers have been
developed, most rely on solid-phase synthesis, which can limit the chemistry and scale of synthesis available
to them. Furthermore, existing automated approaches to oligosaccharide synthesis have focused almost
exclusively on glycosylation reactions, and do not address the time-consuming and tedious process of
converting monosaccharide feedstocks into fully-substituted glycosyl donors ready for coupling. The incredible
number of building blocks required for microbial glycan synthesis also makes keeping every possible block in
stock impossible. All these issues could be addressed by the development of automated continuous flow
platforms. Continuous flow reactions can be more easily automated than multi-step batch processes and
thereby provide greater batch-to-batch reproducibility. Through proper selection of conditions it is also possible
to telescope several reactions into a single run. The objective of this proposal is to generate platform
technologies for automated continuous flow-based oligosaccharide that is capable of automating every step of
oligosaccharide synthesis, from on-demand donor/acceptor production to assembly of these larger molecules
into target structures. We will achieve this by pursuing the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will
examine the automated production of glycosylation ready monosaccharides. By telescoping multiple reactions
into a single run and designing and controlling the system with open-source MechWolf software, this approach
will allow for the construction of these important intermediates from commercial feedstock in much more rapid
timescales than is currently possible. This will include developing rapid chemo-enzymatic syntheses of
otherwise difficult to access nonulosonic (9-carbon) acid carbohydrate building blocks commonly associated
with several pathogenic microbes. In addition, the MechWolf program will provide an open-source chemical
repository for optimal conditions for the production of any protected monosaccharide to ensure batch-to-batch
reproducibility and on-demand access of these building blocks. Specific Aim 2 will extend this technology to the
automated production of oligosaccharides. The flexible and modular nature of continuous flow synthesis will
allow for the construction of glycosidic linkages that are not trivial to make on existing platforms and for which
few if any enzymes are available. As proof of principle, the system will be used to construct several capsular
polysaccharides associated with the ESKAPE pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii; however, these
technologies and concepts could be used for the construction of any oligosaccharide. Taken together, the
technologies developed through this research will lead to a rapid, robust, reproducible, and affordable method
for automated oligosaccharide production with minimal need for human optimization and intervention."
10864984,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic pain is a serious condition which is produced and maintained by a variety of different
mechanisms, many of which remain poorly understood This has led to difficulties in providing effective
treatments. One key mechanism underlying chronic pain conditions, such as nociplastic pain, is central
sensitization in which plastic changes at the level of the spinal cord contribute to and maintain hypernociception.
To add further complexity, we have found that different mechanisms underlie the acute, transition, and chronic
phases of central sensitization in our model of nociplastic pain. In order to better understand, and therefore
successfully treat, chronic pain conditions, the mechanisms underlying these three phases, as well as resolution
of chronic pain, must be elucidated. Already, I have shown that excitation of capsaicin-sensitive afferents
attenuates the response of sGABAn to low-intensity synaptic stimulation. Furthermore, I have shown that spinal
microglia and inflammation mediate the chronic phase of central sensitization underlying a nociplastic pain state.
 In the F99 phase of the proposed project, I will further characterize the neuronal circuitry underlying the
acute and maintenance phases of central sensitization, focusing on 1) how nociceptor activation and subsequent
release of reactive oxygen species impair Aβ-fiber-evoked sGABAn activation in the acute phase, 2) whether
such impairment allows low-threshold afferent inputs to activate spinal microglia to drive the transition phase,
and 3) if reactive microglia and inflammatory mediators maintain the impairment in the chronic phase.
 In the K00 phase, I will move to a prominent pain research laboratory to investigate the mechanisms by
which pro-resolution lipid mediators, such as resolvins, are dysregulated in pain conditions, and their effect on
nociceptive circuitry. Additionally, I will investigate how resolvins and the circuitry which they effect may be
manipulated to convert chronic pain back to resolving pain.
 Overall, the proposed project will provide key understanding of the chronification and resolution of
nociceptive neural circuit sensitization. These will ultimately reveal new therapeutic targets, allowing for the
development of better pain treatments."

Summary
The NEIDL Administrative Core provides the leadership, organizational structure, and direction of an
established management plan that sustains the resources and infrastructure of the NEIDL at the highest level.
This enables us to meet our mandate as a member of NIAID’s national and regional biocontainment
laboratories network (the NBL-RBL network). It also ensures that we meet our mission to conduct cutting-edge
research in the pathogenesis of emerging infectious diseases, and support development of the next generation
of therapeutics, vaccines and diagnostics for emerging and remerging pathogens. The Administrative Core
Serves as the focal point for coordinating, supervising and supporting all of the activities of the NEIDL,
including all BSL-4 related activities. The specific aims of the core are to: 1. Coordinate and manage all NEIDL
administrative and scientific support activities, including the review process for scientific projects requiring
access to BSL-4 services and facilities; 2. Evaluate research progress and encourage data sharing, including
promotion of collaborations with local, national, and global scientific communities; 3. Provide a high level of
administrative support to optimize faculty and staff productivity, to ensure compliance with university
administrative requirements for faculty and staff, and to assist Core leaders with administrative aspects of their
Cores; 4. Ensure collaboration and coordination among core leaders, and communicate and interact with
NIAID staff. 5. Conduct administrative oversight and fiscal management of the NEIDL through an
organizational management structure, in particular to manage BSL-4 related NEIDL finances, including the
operation of cost-recovery activities for each of the Cores; and 6) Partner with NIAID and other federal
agencies in the management of all NEIDL BSL-4 facilities and operations, biosecurity, regulatory compliance,
specialized research support services, and training activities in support of the national biodefense research
agenda as needed."
10892809,"Core 1: Facility Maintenance and Operation
Abstract
The NEIDL Facilities Maintenance and Operations (FMO) Core is comprised of three functional areas:
Facilities, Information Technology and Community Relations. Each is tasked with closely related but distinct
responsibilities that collectively maintain the function, safety, and community understanding of the NEIDL BSL-
4 and ABSL-4 operations. Facilities (FAC) provides in-house biocontainment facility operations and
management expertise in support of BSL-4 research and regulatory compliance; and continues to advance
BSL-4 operations through training of staff, performing risk assessment-based repair and maintenance
activities, improving SOP’s, future planning for infrastructure needs and technology advancements, and
managing regulatory compliance of biocontainment performance requirements. Partners with EH&S, IT, Public
Safety and Research Cores to meet overarching NEIDL goals and progressively expand efficiencies and
effectiveness over the next 5 years and beyond. Information Technology (IT) supports BSL-4 research by
developing and deploying state-of-the-art technology solutions and training to BSL-4 researchers and staff,
such as “in-suit” hands-free communications systems, video-enhanced SOPs for in-lab training and use,
dedicated instrumentation computing resources and mobile applications for BSL-4 laboratory use. The next
five years of technology advances will focus on testing and implementing multiple IT systems for BSL-4
science. The Community Relations (CR) Unit builds and nurtures relationships with the community by
engaging Community Liaison Committee to build engagement programs that build trust and mutual respect
with our community. Traditional forms of engagement like hosting NEIDL facility tours, panel discussions, and
hands-on educational programs will be adapted in response to the new challenges and health risks posed by
the global COVID-19 pandemic."
10892812,"Core 2: Biosecurity Core
Abstract
The Biosecurity Core is responsible for the protection of the NEIDL in support of a safe and secure research
environment. It does so by preventing unauthorized access to the perimeter, the facility, the BSL-4 laboratory
and storage locations in order to protect the select agent program from theft, loss and release and by serving
as the initial responder to incidents and events. The Biosecurity Core relies on an ongoing program of threat
and risk assessment and training, management of access control systems, and coordination with other cores
or departments in the management of the Personnel Suitability and Reliability Policy (PSRP). The Core is
integrated with campus-wide services and provides protective services to the NEIDL 24 hours/day, 7
days/week. The core is led by the Executive Director of Public Safety/Chief of Police and the Medical Campus
Public Safety Director and includes a Personnel Suitability Specialist, Systems integrators, Public Safety
Officers and Shift Supervisors. The Biosecurity Core interacts on a continuous basis with the Environmental
Health and Biosafety Regulations and Requirements Core (EHBRR), Facilities and Maintenance Core (FMO),
NEIDL leadership and NEIDL laboratory managers to review SOPs, staffing, security issues and incidents and
work collaboratively to ensure coordination between institutional and NEIDL programs. The Personnel
Suitability Specialist is responsible for the initial steps in the PSRP and the follow through as elements of the
process by EHRBB and Human Resources are completed. The Core then confirms that all requirements have
been met before assigning access in accordance with that policy. Clearances are initiated and checked initially
and then annually thereafter. Access is granted, adjusted or revoked annually or as needed. The Core is
represented on the Personnel Suitability Review Team and involved in issues that require adjustment of
access permissions. Systems Integrators manage a variety or security systems that allow access and do so in
coordination with FMO and NEIDL IT staff. NEIDL Public Safety Officers are sworn Special State Police
Officers licensed by the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety. They are trained and equipped with a
firearm and other protective tools. Officer training is not limited to the police academy and includes emergency
first responder, biological safety, and other NEIDL specific training. The Core not only participated in the
training programs but leads and instructs on trainings related to insider threat and CPR training programs. The
Biosecurity Core participates in exercises, provides subject matter expertise in their design when needed,
provides training to external first responders and meets with the Boston Biosafety Working Group (local
emergency medical, fire, police, public health) when necessary. The Core is involved in the transportation of
highly hazardous materials and serves as primary contact to external law enforcement agencies."

Abstract
The Environmental Health and Biosafety Regulations and Requirements (EHBRR) Core includes three
components: Environmental Health and Safety, Emergency Management, and Occupational Medicine. The
Core is integrated with campus-wide services under the direction of the Office of Research Compliance (ORC).
The role of the EHBRR Core at the NEIDL is to provide for and ensure the health, safety and preparedness of
all personnel who work at and support the NEIDL's BSL4 facility, and in this manner all who work within the
building. These responsibilities are carried out in a coordinated and collaborative manner starting with the initial
application for NEIDL employment or assignment, and continuing throughout the duration of work in the
NEIDL. The EHBRR Core includes the Chief Safety Officer, Responsible Official, Occupational Health Officer,
and the BSL-4 Biosafety Officer. EHBRR, as part of the BU Office of Research Compliance utilities the
expertise of the University Chemical Hygiene Officer, Chemical Safety Officer, Environmental Manager,
Radiation Safety Officer, Chief Medical Physicist and others. EHBRR oversees the NEIDL Personnel Suitability
and Reliability Program (PSRP) addressing initial and annual clearances and chairs the Personnel Suitability
Review Team. Once individuals are cleared for entry into the NEIDL, EHBRR provides or coordinates initial
and ongoing competency-based training including NEIDL orientation, lab safety, CPR, select agents, insider
threat, agent/lab/equipment specific information and response to emergencies. EHBRR manages emergency
response planning, exercises, after-action reports and correction action plans. The BSL-4 Biosafety Officer
chairs the BSL-4 NEIDL Training Advisory Committee tasked with ensuring that those entering BSL-4 labs are
prepared to do so. EHBRR coordinates, manages and documents inventory audits with the Laboratory
Manager and the Principal Investigator and conducts follow up investigations and reporting if necessary. The
core is responsible for all aspects of safety within the BSL-4 laboratories including the testing and verification
of biocontainment systems in coordination with the Facilities Core, the decontamination of equipment and
space and the management of certifications. EHBRR does so using contracted services when unable to do so
directly. EHBRR manages compliance with the Centers for Disease Control and Surveillance (CDC) Select
Agent Program and the Boston Public Health Commission (BPHC) BSL-4 Laboratory Regulations. These
responsibilities include registration/permitting activities, maintenance of records and oversight of administrative
actions required to maintain compliance. EHBRR coordinates closely with Principal Investigators on proposed

10892816,"Core 4: Regulatory Compliance
Abstract
The Regulatory Compliance Core (RCC) serves to facilitate the advanced development of medical
countermeasures for pathogens that require maximum containment. This includes studies aimed to evaluate
efficacy by evaluation in animal models intended for submission via the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) Animal Rule, or studies aimed to evaluate safety following the FDA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
regulations. Together with studies that are performed under a Quality System agreed with a sponsor, these are
considered “Well Documented Studies.” The RCC is comprised of a Nonclinical Studies unit, that is
responsible for the conduct of studies, and an independent Quality Assurance Unit provides oversight of those
studies to assure compliance with regulations. The specific aims of the RCC are to: 1. Develop and refine the
processes required to carry out Well-Documented studies, respond to audits, and continually improve the
program; 2. Monitor Well Documented studies for accuracy and integrity of any data generated in such
studies; 3. Conduct relevant Well Documented compliance training for relevant personnel; 4. Develop policies
and procedures pertaining to the Regulatory Compliance Core. The RCC is the fulcrum for all the stakeholders
involved in the accomplishment of Well Documented Studies. Critical participants in studies include: Principal
Investigators, Study Directors (SD), Study Point of Control (SPOC); Quality Assurance; Test Facility
Management (TFM); Boston University Leadership; Sponsors; Laboratorians; Veterinary staff; Facility
maintenance; and Biological safety. Coordination of a Well Documented study relies on tight integration and
begins with early and frequent communication. The PI of a study, the SD for GLP, or SPOC for Animal Rule,
and members of the Quality Assurance Unit start discussing a project during the proposal development stage.
This assures that feasibility, including consideration of the Master Schedule, are considered and risks are
mitigated. In particular, it is preferred that a sponsor agrees to a Quality Plan for a study that does not have a
GLP-requirement; the SD/SPOC, PI, and Quality Assurance Unit work closely to develop these plans. As the
protocol is developed further other stakeholders are incorporated into the discussions. All parties are involved
in the execution of a study, and RCC assures a lessons-learned discussion occurs following study completion."
10892818,"Core 5: Integrated Research Support Services
Abstract
The Integrated Research Support Services (ISS) Core serves to organize shared services that are provided to
the research community within the NEIDL. These services support BSL-4/ABSL-4 studies to ensure that each
investigator does not have to recreate infrastructure and expertise in their laboratories in order to carry out their
funded research programs. The core will develop schedules and manage costs so that reasonable and
responsible user fees are charged to investigators using these services to offset overall costs, as appropriate.
The services offered evolve over time such that new services can be offered as the needs of the research
community changes. Currently, core is broadly separated into the Animal Research Support Services, and the
BSL-4 Laboratory Services. Animal Research Services includes trained veterinary professionals and veterinary
technicians who collaborate with faculty to carry out studies in various animal models. The team is trained on a
number of procedures to increase safety when working with animals, especially those that require the use of
sharps. This unit also works with investigators to ensure the humane use of animals and to comply with
institutional animal care and use committee requirements. Within the BSL-4 Laboratory Services, a number of
units exist to support the BSL-4 and ABSL-4 studies. These include Veterinary Pathology (anatomic and
laboratory) Service which oversees the necropsy services, storage and maintenance of the samples in
compliance with the CDC select agent program, and is responsible for establishing and validating the
inactivation protocols required to move tissues to the BSL-2. The Veterinary Pathologist is responsible for
clinical chemistry. Virology Services is responsible for receiving, validating, and inventorying viruses that are
utilized in BSL-4 research. This includes generating master and working stocks as well as maintaining an
accurate inventory of agents. This core also develops advanced virologic tools as needed. The Viral Genomic
Tracking and Single Cell omics Resource is responsible for ensuring the fidelity of viral stocks from VS given to
investigators for their research, and for initiating single cell sequencing and single virus omics technologies in
the BSL-4. The Imaging Services Unit provides several platforms to study living tissue specimens infected with
BSL-4 pathogens, including Light Sheet microscopy. Many of the BSL-4 investigators rely on services from the
NEIDL Comparative Pathology Laboratory (NCPL). Immunology Services provides training, guidance and
maintenance of advanced immunology instrumentation inside the BSL-4 footprint, including flow cytometry.
High-throughput screening has been operationalized to include automated visual screening of virus infected
cells treated with small molecule inhibitors, and can be adapted to any virus or cell target. Linking the Clinic to
NEIDL Programs includes a clinician whose responsibilities are to link clinical outcomes to the studies that are
undertaken in the NEIDL (for comparative purposes) as well as to engage with clinical programs to obtain
clinical samples for studies."

The primary goal of the Penn ADRC is to increase research and education on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its
links to related disorders (ADRD) across the continuum of normal aging to dementia with the goal of identifying
the causes of and cures for AD/ADRD. To achieve this goal, the Penn ADRC coordinates research programs,
stimulates new research, catalyzes academic research training, provides community education and outreach
and fosters the development of novel techniques to individualize diagnosis and treatment for the benefit of all
elderly persons and their families. It is the role of the Administrative Core to shepherd and facilitate the
activities of the ADRC Cores and to serve as a bridge between the ADRC and national and international efforts
in pursuit of these goals.
 Administrative Core will be involved in a number of different activities that are designed to achieve these
broad goals, including fiscal and administrative oversight over the ADRC (Aim 1). The leaders of the ADRC
and the ADRC Executive Committee, composed of core leaders and co-leaders, will set priorities and develop
plans to achieve ADRC goals. The Administrative Core will choose members of an External Advisory
Committee that will be charged with the role of evaluating the progress of the Center and providing
recommendations (Aim 2). A variety of forums and opportunities for exchange of ideas and dissemination of
data will be supported by the Administrative Core through ADRC sponsored retreats and lecture series (Aim 3).
These events will include participation of faculty and trainees, providing an opportunity, particularly for the
latter, to present data and receive feedback. Critical to the growth and breadth of AD/ADRC research, a unique
Developmental Project program linked to topics at annual retreats will foster transdisciplinary work (Aim 4). The
Administrative Core will champion participation of the Penn ADRC in numerous state, national, and
international efforts to improve care and treatment of ADRD, as well as provide infrastructure to support the
sharing of data and biomaterials (Aim 5). Finally, the core will provide oversight on all NIA and local regulatory
and reporting procedures and requirements (Aim 6).
 Critically, the Administrative Core serves to maintain the “centeredness” of the ADRC by coordinating efforts
across the individual cores, by promoting collaborations with other neurodegenerative centers at Penn and
beyond, and by promoting activities consistent with our thematic focus around AD heterogeneity. By achieving
the above aims, we expect to maintain our highly productive ADRC with the appropriate support to do novel
research, to contribute highly and deeply phenotyped individuals to larger data sharing efforts, to grow our
diverse and multi-disciplinary faculty by training the next generation of investigators and clinicians, and to
educate and empower our region and the nation so as to improve brain health and meet the goals of NAPA."

The theme of the Penn ADRC is to better understand both the upstream factors and processes that contribute
to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) heterogeneity and the downstream markers critical to characterizing it. The
Clinical Core serves as the central node for this thematic mission by deeply characterizing a clinically and
demographically diverse cohort (Aim 1). Given the importance of understanding heterogeneity in the context of
the entire AD continuum, we will recruit, assess, and longitudinally follow a cohort, the ADRC UDS Cohort, that
spans cognitively normal older adults to those with mild dementia. To capture phenotypic diversity and overlap
with other neurodegenerative conditions, the cohort includes frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy Body
disease, and atypical and early onset AD presentations. In collaboration with the Outreach, Recruitment, and
Engagement Core (ORE), recruitment of African Americans, a group poorly represented in AD research, is
also a priority and enhances efforts to examine the diversity of factors that contribute to heterogeneity in
expression of disease (Aim 3).
 In the context of the transformation of AD from being defined as a clinical diagnosis to a disease defined by
biomarkers, the Penn ADRC embraces the importance of biomarker acquisition and validation. The Clinical
Core facilitates these efforts through acquisition of plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and MRI and PET imaging
(Aim 2). These materials and data are obtained in close collaboration with the Biomarker and Neuroimaging
Cores and allow for classification of individuals on the basis of the presence or absence of cerebral b-amyloid
plaques (A), tau-based neurofibrillary tangles (T), and neurodegeneration (N). Thus, in as many participants as
possible, we will obtain biofluid (CSF and plasma) and/or neuroimaging A/T/(N) designation. To capture the
role of cerebrovascular disease (CVD) in AD heterogeneity, we will obtain clinical, biofluid, and neuroimaging
measures of risk or downstream manifestations of CVD (e.g. white matter hyperintensities). The Clinical Core
will also be a source of genetic material and brain tissue obtained in conjunction with the Genomics and
Neuropathology Cores, which will be linked to the above biomarker and clinical data.
 In light of the potential modulating effect on disease risk, phenotype, and resilience versus vulnerability, we
will also obtain measures of social determinants of health (SDoH; Aim 4), which potentially will provide a
deeper understanding of the role of ethnoracial differences in disease risk and presentation.
 In addition to the sharing of this rich and diverse dataset and materials with the National Alzheimer’s
Coordinating Center (NACC) and with other ADRCs and institutions, the Clinical Core participates in numerous
multi-site collaborative clinical research and intervention studies with the goal of advancing care of people with
AD/ADRD (Aim 5). Finally, the Clinical Core serves as an important base for training efforts with the Research
Education Component to develop the next generation of investigators and clinicians."
10927213,"Summary 
The goal of Administrative Core in Phase 2 is to continue centralizing and managing resources necessary to 
enhance the success of the COBRE on Host-pathogen Interactions (HPI). Building on the success of Phase 1, 
this Core will provide support to investigators focused on determining the mechanisms underlying immune 
modulations in the host upon interaction with various microbes to identify possible treatments for devastating 
inflammatory diseases. Specifically, the concerted effort will focus on (1) expanding the research enterprise of 
this center by supporting and recruiting junior investigators working on host-microbe interactions that are central 
to human health and diseases; (2) facilitating productive scientific interactions by organizing networking 
opportunities through annual symposium and seminar series ; (3) providing an individualized and tailored 
mentoring program for each investigator; 4) providing oversight and support for mentoring programs through 
Internal and External Advisory Committees with regular meetings; 5) raising the national profile of the group by 
providing cutting edge infrastructural support; 6) establishing a new Computational Data Analysis Core facility to 
provide cutting-edge bioinformatics analytical and interpretative support for the group; 6) providing administrative 
support to the existing Cores (Histology, Imaging and Flow Cytometry; and 7) fostering collaboration between 
the other North Dakota COBRE, INBRE and CTR DaCCoTA grant supported groups and between individuals in 
the respective groups. Successful completion of these goals in Phase 2 of our COBRE will elevate this center to 
a nationally recognized level with a group dedicated to understanding various aspects of host-microbe 
interactions in human health and disease. With the recent funding of a Phase 2 Epigenetics COBRE and a Phase 
I Clinical Translational Research Center DaCCoTA, our HPI COBRE Phase 2 has an unprecedented opportunity 
at hand to execute high-quality, cutting edge research of immense therapeutic and clinical potential."
10870023,"Neuropathology Core: Abstract
Nearly all neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by progressive accumulations of pathological
deposits of disease protein aggregates within cells, blood vessels or in the neuropil. These deposits are the
signature CNS lesions that define these disorders as exemplified by the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary
tangles required for the postmortem diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD).
However, Lewy bodies (LBs) and/or TDP-43 inclusions occur in ~70% of AD patients, as are other
neuropathologies including aging related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), hippocampal sclerosis, and
cerebrovascular disease. Other non-AD dementing illnesses are associated with a diverse spectrum of
neuropathologic diagnoses including various α-synucleinopathies and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. A
major focus of this NP Core is to define the full spectrum of co-morbid protein aggregate pathologies in the
aging brain. A comprehensive post-mortem brain examination of individuals followed longitudinally in the
Clinical Core provides definitive classification of the underlying neuropathology using standardized criteria in
addition to the exhaustive documentation of co-morbid neurodegenerative disease pathologies in each case
irrespective of clinical phenotype. Fixed and frozen tissues are banked and distributed to investigators to
further both clinicopathologic and basic research studies on AD/ADRD. Neuropathology data is obtained in all
cases which is transmitted to the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center in collaboration with the DMS Core.
The NP Core also coordinates with the Neuroimaging Core to facilitate high resolution post-mortem MRI and to
establish a digital histopathology library. The NP Core also provides advice and support to investigators
including trainees supported by the Research Education Component to foster safe and informative human
biosamples research. Thus, this NP Core is a vital component of the Penn ADRC in defining the complexity
and breadth of neuropathologic change in ADRC subjects in support of its mission to increase research and
education on AD/ADRD across the continuum from normal aging to dementia with the goal of identifying the
causes of and cures for AD/ADRD."
10927220,"SUMMARY. The objective of this project is to support the imaging and image analysis needs of the COBRE
Phase 2 program while continuing to support the broader research community. All four Phase 2 Project Leaders
propose to identify and characterize the factors that control host responses to viral, bacterial, and parasitic
pathogens using confocal, fluorescence and electron microscopy and quantitative image analysis. The Core is
well equipped to meet these needs. Core equipment includes a multiphoton microscope for intravital microscopy,
a confocal microscope, two epifluorescence microscope systems, one capable of TIRF microscopy and both
equipped for live cell imaging, scanning and transmission electron microscopes, and a workstation with several
image analysis tools. The Core proposes four specific aims to ensure that COBRE investigators (Phase 2 and
Phase 1 Project Leaders) and the broader research community can meet their research goals. First, the Core
director and staff will collaborate with COBRE investigators and other members of the research community by
assisting with the development of experimental designs and microscopy approaches, analyzing microscopy
images, and interpreting data collected in the Core. Second, Core staff will provide training in equipment use,
microscopic imaging services, and educational resources to COBRE investigators and other members of the
research community. Third, the Core will provide image analysis software tools and expertise to support
quantitative microscopy studies by COBRE investigators and other members of the research community. Finally,
the Core will upgrade its equipment by replacing an outdated epifluorescence microscope and seeking funding
through the S10 Shared Instrumentation Grant Program to replace the Core Zeiss confocal microscope with a
new confocal microscope system. The outcome of these aims will be expansion of Core services, increased
Core research capabilities, new research opportunities for users and advancement of the Core’s goals to expand
the user base and achieve long-term sustainability."
10870027,"Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement Core Summary
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is undergoing a scientific and cultural revolution. Discoveries about the disease’s
pathophysiology are transforming our understanding of AD as well as how clinicians diagnose and treat it, and
the US has a sustained commitment to a national Alzheimer’s plan. Milestones are in place to achieve
ambitious goals that include transformations to the delivery of care and, by 2025, the discovery of methods to
effectively treat and prevent the disease. Gene and biomarker-based clinical trials have been launched for
persons with dementia, and also those in the MCI stage and even the “preclinical” stage. At the same time,
research shows there is substantial heterogeneity within and overlap between AD and other late-life
neurodegenerative diseases, giving credence to the concept of AD and related dementias (AD/ADRD). And
yet, despite all this progress, all this knowledge, persons with dementia and their families still struggle to find
decent care, must cope with sometimes crushing stigma, and experience social and economic disparities. A
major focus of the Penn ADRC is to promote and disseminate research that advances this revolutionary
understanding of AD/ADRD, explains the heterogeneity of the disease, improves care, and addresses stigma
and disparities. This focus informs the overarching goals of the Penn ADRC’s Outreach, Recruitment and
Engagement (ORE) Core: to advance research, to promote public understanding, and to foster better ways for
patients, families, and America to live with AD/ADRD. We will achieve this goal in part through collaboration
with the Administrative Core and REC to support the development of Penn ADRC staff and
professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and skills related to communications, cognitive aging, AD/ADRD, the
stages of these diseases, care and caregiving, stigma, and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Working with
the Clinical and Administrative Cores and community partners, we will develop and implement
effective outreach and engagement programs to educate the public, people living with MCI and dementia, and
caregivers and families about AD/ADRD, as well as to build support structures and promote research that
address the distinct challenges AD/ADRD poses to well-being and autonomy. The Black or African-American
community will be an emphasis of this work. We will also work with Penn ADRC investigators and their
collaborators to develop strategies and tactics to recruit and retain subjects for AD/ADRD research protocols,
including clinical trials. This work, in collaboration with our community partners and the Clinical, Data
Management and Statistical, Neuropathology, Genomics, Neuroimaging, and Biomarker Cores, has an
emphasis on research to collect data measuring the social determinants of brain health in addition to genetic
material and biomarkers of AD/ADRD."
10927225,"Summary
The Histology Core at UND was established to improve the infrastructure supporting our successful
implementation of the Phase 1 Center for Excellence in Host Pathogen Interactions COBRE at the University
of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences. The Core was developed to provide high quality
instrumentation, tissue preparation, staining, image analysis services, and training in a wide spectrum of
fundamental and advanced histological techniques to COBRE research investigators. The Core also provides
access and support to non-COBRE investigators within and outside the UND SMHS, as well as those from
institutions adjoining (USDA-Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center) and in neighboring cities (North
Dakota State University, North Dakota primarily undergraduate institutions and tribal colleges). The Core
remains essential for successful growth of the host pathogen interaction enterprise at UND and completing al
four of the projects proposed in this Phase 2 renewal application. The Core evolved from being a primarily
shared equipment facility with provided user training to now a complete drop off service facility for users across
the UND campus. Multiple tissue sectioning and staining services coupled with whole slide brightfield or
fluorescent imaging and image quantitation have made the Core invaluable to growth of the research
enterprise at UND. In Phase 2, the Core will continue to assist COBRE team members and the broader
UND/ND research community with experimental design specifically with regards to application-specific sample
preparation techniques, identifying appropriate analytical tools available, resolution restrictions, and quantitative
morphological techniques. The Core will also provide service, training, and instruction to COBRE and other
users in all aspects of instrument use, safety, tissue sample preparation, and aid with trouble shooting all
aspects of tissue preparation and analysis. Finally, the Core will implement a business plan that includes
strategies to continue expanding the user base and provide fee-for-service assistance in all aspects of histo-
and immunochemical detection methods and analyses, thus paving a way to long-term sustainability of the
Core."
10870031,"BIOMARKER CORE SUMMARY:
With the increasing emphasis in the Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) field on molecular diagnosis, the Biomarker Core
has two over-arching goals. First, we will continue a highly-successful tradition at the University of Pennsylvania
of banking and widely dispersing biofluid samples obtained by the Clinical Core, while annotating these samples
with baseline molecular measures that allow for Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration (A/T/(N)) classification within
the NIA-AA framework. Second, we will pave new ground by relating well-established CSF- and imaging-based
A/T/(N) biomarkers to measures obtained from emerging plasma-based biomarkers, and performing measures
that will allow for investigation of the contribution of vascular disease to heterogeneity of clinical phenotype.
These goals will be met through activities along five Specific Aims. AIM 1: Oversee and direct all banking and
dispersal of biofluid samples obtained in ADRC UDS participants (current n=537). AIM 2: Characterize
established biochemical biomarkers previously reported in the literature in order to annotate all Clinical Core
samples within the A/T/(N) classification scheme. A CSF biochemical biomarker profile defined by (1) CSF
amyloid-beta 1-42 (CSF Aβ42) and (2) 1-40 (CSF Aβ40), (3) CSF total tau (CSF t-tau), (4) CSF tau
phosphorylated at residue 181 (CSF p-tau181), (5) CSF neurofilament light chain (CSF NfL), and (6) plasma NfL
measures will be established. AIM 3: Relate emerging plasma-based biomarkers to established CSF and
imaging biomarkers, as well as neuropathology. We will focus on assays of plasma p-tau and plasma Aβ,
validating measures from samples obtained antemortem against postmortem findings. For well-validated assays,
we will obtain plasma measures on all ADRC UDS participants. AIM 4: Collaborate with other Cores to
investigate the contribution of vascular disease to heterogeneity of clinical phenotype. We will support the
collection of biomarker measures (i.e. CRP, cholesterol, hemoglobin A1c, interleukin-6 (IL-6), homocysteine)
that allow for assessment of vascular risk in all ADRC UDS participants. AIM 5: Provide advice and support to
investigators within and outside the Penn ADRC."
10853106,"OVERALL: ABSTRACT
This Dallas Medical District UTSW-D FIRST proposal is submitted jointly by the University of Texas Southwest-
ern Medical Center (UTSW) and the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD). Our institutions have complementary
scientific strengths and a track record of productive collaboration. Our integrated FIRST approach will jointly
recruit a cohort of exceptional and diverse junior faculty to the Medical District in the three cluster areas of Bio-
medical Engineering (BME), Brain Science, and Cancer. Our FIRST Programs will catalyze a cultural transfor-
mation and increase diversity, equity, inclusion, accessibility (DEIA) and vitality of our faculty. The overall goal
is to improve DEI culture that will enhance recruitment of talents from URGs to become FIRST Scholars, and
to nurture them through rigorous career development approaches to help them build their career and retain
them in the long run. These achievements in diverse excellence will further increase DEI culture and have long
term impact. Aim 1 will establish an innovative joint FIRST cohort program using fiscally responsible, evi-
dence-based approaches that will be rigorously tested within our unique environment. We will leverage our ex-
periences from existing institutional cohort development programs such UTSW’s Endowed Scholars (ES) Pro-
gram and UTD’s ADVANCE. The longstanding ES program has a 95% promotion rate to Associate Professor
with tenure and produced 2 HHMI Investigators, dept. chairs and center directors. UTD’s NSF ADVANCE: Or-
ganizational Change for Gender Equity in STEM Academic Professions program is newer but has great poten-
tial. We will learn from these programs to create our unique joint FIRST program with an explicit focus on co-
hort hiring for diversity excellence. We will also grow the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and
medicine (STEMM) pathways to increase future URG faculty. This aim will focus on recruitment of talented
URG faculty and is described in the ADMINISTRATIVE core. Aim 2 will ensure that our FIRST Scholars thrive
and succeed at our institutions for the long-term. We will proactively onboard FIRST Scholars and provide cus-
tomized mentorship and research support. We will offer, executive coaching, management and leadership
training, career development, allyship and sponsorship. These approaches are described in the FACULTY
DEVELOPMENT core. Aim 3 will use rigorous evidence-based quantitative and qualitative approaches to eval-
uate our FIRST program. We will assess the impacts of the cohort model, our interventions, and contextual
factors at multiple levels. This aim is described in the EVALUATION Core. Our evaluation will inform our future
approaches to foster a sustainable institutional culture to increase the diversity of the UTSW and UTD faculty
and leadership. The FIRST legacy will be sustained using data-driven strategies to guide institutional and de-
partmental leaders to incorporate best practices to overcome structural and institutional barriers for DEI cul-
ture, and to enhance and deepen the science workforce pathways and academic-community partnerships."
10853107,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: ABSTRACT
The Medical District UTSW-D FIRST Program will jumpstart the recruitment of a cohort of outstanding junior
faculty from underrepresented groups (URG). Five Scholars each will be recruited by the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and by the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) to the Dallas Medical
District. The cohorts will specialize in three (3) interrelated cluster areas of biomedical engineering (BME),
brain science, and cancer. All FIRST Scholars will have laboratories in the Medical District, including the new
UTSW-UTD Biomedical Engineering and Sciences Building. Aim 1 will organize an efficient and effective
administrative structure to oversee all aspects of the FIRST program. The multi-PIs (MPIs) from UTSW and
UTD will direct joint implementation teams in each of the three FIRST cores (Administrative, Faculty
Development and Evaluation). We will have several levels of oversight including the Executive Committee that
includes all Core leaders and the External Advisory Board. We will continuously adapt a shared organizational
structure to foster collaboration and engagement among stakeholders. Aim 2 will develop and administer
proactive and unbiased approaches to identify and recruit URG candidates to our joint FIRST program as first-
time tenure track faculty. We will use a data-driven strategic approach that includes assembling a scouting
network of faculty for outreach and “upstream” recruitment of candidates still in postdoctoral training. We will
initiate multi-year relationships to encourage applications to FIRST. Aim 3 will design an integrated faculty
development program to launch our FIRST Scholars’ independent scientific careers and retain them at our
institutions. Aim 4 will develop and strengthen pathway programs for upstream recruitment of future URG
faculty in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM), and sustain impactful long-
term improvement in our institutional diversity, equity, and inclusion culture. Impact: Our proposal to enhance
diversity within the faculty populations at the Medical District as well as the broader UTSW and UTD
communities, together with robust pathway development programs, will expand the scientific workforce and its
diversity in the Dallas metro area in the immediate and long terms. FIRST will advance extramural research
and training to promote the scientific, medical, and moral imperatives for the future."
10853110,"FACULTY DEVELOPMENT CORE: ABSTRACT
UT Southwestern (UTSW) and UT Dallas (UTD) have multiple complementary strengths, including synergistic
collaborations in the three FIRST cluster areas of biomedical engineering (BME), brain science, and cancer,
and robust faculty development programs. Our joint Dallas Medical District UTSW-D FIRST program will recruit
a cohort of outstanding junior faculty from underrepresented groups (URG) in these cluster areas to the Medi-
cal District. UTSW-D FIRST faculty will be co-located in an exceptional environment with outstanding research
space, core facilities, and interactive faculty. Our FIRST Scholars will be nurtured with focused career develop-
ment opportunities and a fair and clear path to become senior faculty and future leaders. We are committed
to retaining our talented faculty as they progress up the academic ladder. Aim 1 will design an inte-
grated onboarding program to launch the independent scientific careers of our FIRST Scholars. We will de-
velop a faculty-launch web-based checklist to guide transition from postdocs to faculty. We will take advantage
of the unique strengths of our two institutions to establish interdisciplinary/interinstitutional tiered mentoring
teams. Scholars will receive scientific management training and executive coaching. Aim 2 will create a long-
term career development program to grow FIRST Scholars’ careers and retain them. We will launch
innovative programs tailored to the need of junior URG investigators and expand already existing
successful faculty career development programs. Aim 3 will promote an inclusive and equitable cul-
ture to enable our FIRST Scholars to reach their fullest potential, unhampered by career-impeding
stresses generated by biases and microaggressions. Aim 4 will ensure a fair and transparent promo-
tion and tenure (P&T) process for Scholar advancement and retention. Together these aims demon-
strate our deep commitment to recruiting and retaining talented FIRST faculty to improve the representation of
URG in the tenure-track and the DEI culture at the Dallas Medical District and beyond. Impact: Our Medical
District UTSW-D FIRST program will have multiple positive downstream effects on science and health of our
community, and its impact will be sustained through long-term institutional support for its current and future di-
verse faculty. Its success will improve the science DEI landscape in Dallas’ two flagship STEMM (Sci-
ence, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, Medicine) institutions. FIRST’s self-reinforcing DEI
and faculty development culture will strengthen our science community and will have multiple posi-
tive downstream effects. Our innovative strategic partnership will be a model for improving inclusive
excellence through institutional partnerships nationwide."
10853114,"EVALUATION CORE: ABSTRACT
The Medical District UTSW-D FIRST EVALUATION core will assess and improve the effectiveness of our joint
Program. Our goal is that our results will inform best practices for increasing diversity hiring of tenure-track fac-
ulty beyond the end of FIRST funding. This work is critical because diversity of tenure-track faculty is currently
the most recalcitrant bottleneck for improving diversity of the biomedical workforce. We have assembled an
evaluation team of experts in mixed-method quantitative and qualitative assessment, and will engage all stake-
holders, including the Scholars, to develop a comprehensive evaluation process. Because the FIRST legacy
can only be sustained by instilling equity and inclusion in all institutional and departmental practices, we will
use a data-driven approach to guide leaders to address structural and institutional barriers effectively. Aim 1
will assess the effect of the FIRST program on our diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) culture at the institu-
tional, departmental, and laboratory levels. We will use quantitative and qualitative approaches to obtain a rich
dataset. The latter includes semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and Town Hall discussions. Aim 2 will
assess the effectiveness of the FIRST ADMINISTRATIVE Core in all aspects of the FIRST talent recruitment
process. These include immediate recruitment of FIRST Scholars and cultivating long term relations with po-
tential future FIRST applicants through our Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and Medicine
(STEMM) pathways. Aim 3 will assess the effectiveness of the Faculty Development Core, which is focused on
supporting our FIRST Scholars by designing onboarding and long-term career development/retention pro-
grams, as well as promoting an equitable culture. Evaluation data will be discussed, and improvements will be
made iteratively in a timely manner. Our rigorous and iterative evaluation practices will drive better administra-
tive and professional development processes and the development of a self-reinforcing system for sustainable
DEI culture change to impact the medical district and both of our sponsoring institutions. Eventually, our results
will have impacts beyond Texas to the entire nation."
10846688,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neural circuits modulating feeding and anxiety must communicate with each other to maintain homeostasis.
Failure to appropriately respond to certain stressors can promote the development of maladaptive feeding
behaviors observed with obesity and eating disorders. Despite an increasing prevalence of both eating and
anxiety disorders, our understanding of the key inputs linking these behavioral states remains rudimentary.
Melanocortin-3 receptor (MC3R) is ideally positioned, both anatomically and functionally, to mediate direct
communication between feeding and anxiety circuits. MC3R is a part of the central melanocortin system and is
implicated in the bidirectional control of responses to homeostatic challenges, providing rheostatic control on
energy storage. Importantly, MC3R neurons bidirectionally regulate both feeding and anxiety, and deletion of
MC3R produces multiple forms of sexually dimorphic disordered eating, including anxiety-related hypophagia.
While it is evident MC3R impacts feeding and anxiety circuitry in both male and female mice, the sexually
dimorphic sites driving these behaviors remain unknown. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) is a
highly differentiated nuclear complex whereby autonomic, emotional and neuroendocrine signals are integrated
and subsequently relayed to hypothalamic and brainstem regions to regulate the expression of motivated
behaviors, including feeding and defensive actions. The BST is centrally involved in stress-related
psychopathologies, such as pathological and adaptive anxiety and also modulates food intake and energy
balance with both anorexic and binge-like eating effects. The BST is also one of the most sexually dimorphic
areas in the brain and thus may regulate sex differences observed in numerous eating and stress-related
clinical disorders. MC3R neurons and terminals are abundantly expressed in the BST, and therefore BSTMC3R
circuitry may function as an integration hub for information driving feeding and anxiety-like behaviors. The
overall hypothesis of this application is MC3R neurons in the BST provide a neurological substrate mediating
communication between feeding and anxiety circuits and may do so differently in males and females. As a first
step in testing this hypothesis, the following two specific aims will be pursued: 1) Define the molecular
phenotype and map the organization of neural inputs and outputs of BSTMC3R neurons and 2) Characterize the
activity of BSTMC3R neurons in feeding and anxiety paradigms and determine if activity is sexually dimorphic.
Completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the role of MC3R in the coordination of feeding
and anxiety, identify important differences between males and females and serve as a crucial step in
discerning the complex feeding behavior associated with obesity and eating disorders."
10889986,"Abstract
Placental dysfunction leads to pregnancy-associated disorders, including intrauterine growth restriction
(IUGR) and preeclampsia, and also serves as a developmental cause for postnatal and adult diseases. Often,
the causal alterations in the placentation process, which lead to defective pregnancies, occur early in
gestation. Defective development and differentiation of trophoblast progenitors are leading causes for
pathological pregnancies. However, we have a poor understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate
trophoblast progenitor self-renewal, differentiation and function in postimplantation embryos. Studies on
mutant mouse models and mouse trophoblast stem cells (mouse TSCs) implicated lysine-specific demethylase 1
(LSD1), the first identified histone demethylas, as a critical regulator to prevent premature differentiation of mouse
TSCs. However, the importance of LSD1 in the context of differentiated trophoblast cells of a matured placenta is
yet to be defined. Also, the importance of LSD1 in human trophoblast development has never been tested. Our
preliminary findings establish that LSD1 expression is conserved in trophoblast progenitors across mammalian
species, including humans. Thus, in this proposal we will investigate importance of LSD1 in the development of
specialized trophoblast cells, namely syncytiotrophoblasts (SynTBs) and invasive trophoblasts, at the maternal-
fetal interface. We will also define importance of LSD1 in human trophoblast differentiation and interrogate LSD1
function.
 Two specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will study Lsd1 conditional knockout mouse model to test the
hypothesis that cell-autonomous function of LSD1 in lineage-specific trophoblast progenitors ensures
establishment of differentiated SynTBs and invasive trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface.
 In Aim 2, using CTB-derived human trophoblast stem cells, we will test the hypothesis that LSD1
establishes a conserved gene expression program in mouse and human trophoblast progenitors and impairment
of LSD1-dependent transcriptional program will impair self-renewal and differentiation potential of human
trophoblast progenitors. In addition, we will also interrogate significance of LSD1-dependent mechanisms in the
context of pathological pregnancies."
10878973,"PROJECT SUMMARY – OVERALL
The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Centers (MMRRC) is the NIH’s premier repository for the
cryopreservation and distribution of genetically engineered and spontaneously mutated mouse alleles held as
live mice, germplasm, and embryonic stem and other cell lines. The MMRRC’s four breeding and distribution
facilities at UC Davis (CA), UNC Chapel Hill (NC), UM Columbia (MO), and The Jackson Laboratories (ME) are
centrally organized through the Informatics, Coordination and Service Center (ICSC), which maintains the
MMRRC’s web presence and provides customer service to the biomedical research community. As such, the
ICSC is responsible for all MMRRC order processing, the coordination of strain donations, data curation, metrics,
and the consortium’s public education & outreach campaign. The objective of this particular application is the
continued operation of the ICSC at the UC Davis campus. This will be accomplished with three designated Cores
that cater to MMRRC (1) Coordination, (2) Customer Service & Public Relations, and (3) Informatics. Each Core’s
Project Lead will direct activities designed to expand the MMRRC’s operations and excellence. More specifically,
the Coordination Core will facilitate internal as well as external MMRRC interactions and collaborations, manage
technical staff, organize MMRRC exchanges with the ORIP/DPCPSI/OD/NIH Program Official, and coordinate
progress reports as well as site visits. The Customer Service & Public Relation Core will act as the first point of
contact for donation, data, and order inquiries from the research community, using web-based interaction as well
as face-to-face representation at professional conferences in addition to targeted efforts to raise awareness of
the MMRRC as a valuable research resource. The Informatics Core will be responsible for the development,
implementation, expansion, and maintenance of the MMRRC website, the relational databases associated with
all ICSC services, communication services hosted at the ICSC, metrics reporting, and the analytical marketing
effort. The ICSC will furthermore engage an Applied Research Project examining the impact of the MMRRC on
the research community at large, using supervised literature analyses. Under its current leadership, the ICSC-
coordinated MMRRC consortium has increased its user base by >50%, nearly doubled its holdings, and orders
reached an all-time high in 2019. This was accomplished by streamlining donation and order processing and
through targeted social media and email campaigns with innovative, user-centered information technology. The
ICSC operation at UC Davis is, hence, well suited for this funding opportunity’s purpose, namely to promote the
MMRRC as the NIH go-to resource to ensure the highest standards of experimental design and quality control
to optimize the reproducibility of mutant mouse research. This is significant because it caters directly to the NIH
mission of promoting research to generate robust and reproducible results for the advancement of human health."
10873852,"1. ABSTRACT: Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with a dismal outcome; fewer than
20% of elderly patients and only 50-65% of pediatric patients are cured and survive more than 3 years following
diagnosis. Despite this, the standard therapy for AML treatment has relied primarily on an intensive combination of ara-
C, daunorubicin, and etoposide (ADE) for over 40 years. Relapsed and resistant disease following treatment with
standard therapy (ADE: ara-C, daunorubicin, and etoposide) are the most common clinical failures that occur in
treating this disease. Application co-PIs, Drs. Lamba (pharmacology) and Pounds (biostatistician specializing in
cancer genomics) have successfully collaborated for over a decade to develop methods and discover molecular
prognostic factors for AML. During our recently completed second funding cycle, we were very productive with 13
scientific publications, 53 conference presentations, and two pending patents. Our second-cycle scientific
achievements include the development of an ara-C SNP score that predicts leukemic cell intracellular levels of ara-
CTP, the active form of ara-C the development of the innovative integrative analysis procedure; canonical
correlation with projection onto the most interesting statistical evidence (CC-PROMISE), that dramatically increases
statistical power for meaningful biological discovery in a rare-disease small sample size setting; using CC-
PROMISE to discover that reduced methylation and increased expression of the DNMT3B associates with greater
genome-wide methylation burden and worse prognosis; translating the DNMT3B discovery into evaluation of
demethylating agents in the ongoing AML16 clinical trial; the development and initial validation of the six-gene
pediatric leukemia stem cell (pLSC6) score (patent pending) and five-gene ADE resistance score (ADE-RS5) score
that predict prognosis. In this renewal application, we propose to accelerate our exciting progress by extensively
validating the pLSC6 and ADE-RS5 scores to provide a robust scientific foundation to translate them into clinical
practice and further developing our understanding of the biological basis of AML development and prognosis into
other molecular domains. In the current proposal we seek to accelerate our exciting progress by extensively validating
the pLSC6 and ADE-RS5 scores in ~ 4000 patients across 10 independent national and international AML cohorts
treated on intensive chemotherapy, to provide a robust scientific foundation for its translation into clinical practice.
In aim 2, we propose to perform a clinical outcome-GWAS (CO-GWAS) and establish prognostic genes and variants
with a constellation of genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic features that associate with clinical outcomes which
will undergo thorough mechanistic validation in aim 2. The successful completion of these studies will be
scientifically and clinically significant by preparing a sound scientific rationale to incorporate prognostic gene
expression scores into the risk stratification of AML patients and revealing additional layers of the molecular basis
of AML prognosis to guide the development of more effective therapies."

Cognitive impairment and dementia are prevalent and cause significant morbidity and substantial financial and
social burden. With the rising number of cases of dementia in the U.S. and worldwide, there is an urgent need
to identify opportunities for preventing or delaying its onset.
 In this infrastructure proposal, we propose to make use of recent advances in genetics by genotyping the
Understanding America Study (UAS) and constructing “polygenic scores” (PGSs), indexes that aggregate the
small effects of millions of genetic variants from across the genome, for use in social-science studies of factors
that increase or mitigate the risk of Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). The UAS, a probability-
based Internet panel housed at the Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR) at the University of
Southern California, longitudinally tracks a sample of approximately 10,000 adults in the U.S. (growing to at least
20,000 by 2026). It combines several sources of information, including from surveys, wearable devices,
administrative linkages, and contextual data, and has several unique features: it provides the opportunity for on-
demand data collection on short notice; it allows for the collection of data at higher frequencies and for the
possibility of initiating new data collection in response to major societal events (such as the COVID-19
pandemic), or triggered by events in the lives of respondents (such as “burst surveys” fielded when there is an
important change in the life of a panel member); it can be used to take advantage of natural experiments; it
allows for frequent collection (once or twice a month) of paradata (computer user-behavior from surveys, e.g.,
errors and processing speed gleaned from keystrokes) which is predictive of cognitive functioning.
 Ours is not a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Instead, we will use genetic variants (SNPs) identified
from existing large, replicated GWASs, to create polygenic scores (PGSs), and exploit unique UAS capabilities,
afforded by its Internet mode of operation, to better understand ADRD risk in a nationally representative sample.
We will use PGSs, as well as APOE-ε4 status, together with longitudinal health, cognitive, behavioral, and
environmental measures, to: (i) identify populations at risk of cognitive decline, (ii) collect new data for causal
inferences of the effects of ADRD risk/protective factors on cognition by genetic ADRD risk, and iii) study the
role of genetics in the resilience to adverse life events affecting cognitive functioning.
 By making publicly available a large number of genetic measures for ADRD, cognitive decline, and
associated protective/risk factors (e.g., physical activity, cardiovascular risk [diabetes, obesity, smoking and
hypertension], diet, sleep, pollution, and education, among others), and through our own research, we seek to
stimulate the use of unique UAS capabilities in economic and social-science research of ADRD, cognitive
impairment, and cognitive decline."

The NIH MMRRC archives, curates, and distributes mouse models of scientific interest to the research
community at minimal cost. While this organization should accelerate the pace of research and provide greater
rigor and reproducibility, there have been no studies that show how successful the program is. The objective of
the proposed Applied Research Project is to better understand the specific impact of the MMRRC on research.
Aim #1 proposes to produce high resolution measurements of how the MMRRC products are used across the
research spectrum as well as details about the users. These studies will indicate the breadth and depth of
research supported by the MMRRC. Aim #2 proposes to measure the impact of the MMRRC by asking questions
such as “are MMRRC users more effective scientists?” This kind of question can be answered by comparing
MMRRC products and users to non-MMRRC products and non-users. Aim #3 proposes to develop research
fingerprints which assist in uniquely identifying research products and authors in the absence of the unique
identifiers provided by RRIDs and ORCID iDs. This will allow us to study the history of MMRRC impact. Research
fingerprints are also useful in clustering researchers by their interests, which will allow us to proactively suggest
mouse models to scientists with shared research interests."
10880566,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure (HF) is a costly and complex health condition affecting millions of Americans. HF care is often
fragmented which negatively affects quality, safety, and patient-centered outcomes. Structured Interprofessional
Bedside Rounds (SIBR) is a model of care developed to bring interprofessional team members together with
patients and families using a structured format to collaboratively arrive at a daily care plan. The SIBR model is
characterized by four core components: an interprofessional approach, utilization of a rounding structure,
intentional patient and family engagement, and development of a shared daily care plan. A growing body of
evidence associates SIBR implementation with improvements in team and patient outcomes. The hypothesized
mechanism through which SIBR operates is that having a predictable structure leads to improvements in
communication, fewer gaps in care, and more consistent utilization of evidence-based approaches. These
changes are thought to lead to improvements in patient outcomes such as, length of stay, readmission rates,
patient-centeredness of care, and safety/adverse events. Despite frequent improvements in outcomes following
SIBR implementation, an evidence gap exists as to the role that fidelity (adherence) to the SIBR model plays in
how and why this model works and the extent to which outcomes can be further improved if fidelity is higher. To
address this knowledge gap, this proposal leverages a timely opportunity to study SIBR fidelity and its
relationship to care and outcomes among patients with advanced HF at the University of Washington Medical
Center, where a SIBR model has been the standard of care for 4+ years. The central hypothesis is that higher-
fidelity SIBR will be associated with better outcomes. To test this hypothesis, I will carry out a prospective cohort
study to achieve three specific aims: (1) identify associations between SIBR fidelity and patient outcomes, (2)
determine the extent to which SIBR fidelity predicts time to initiation and completion of an evidence-based
“Advanced HF Work-Up Pathway”, and (3) examine patient and family experiences of care quality and safety in
the context of higher- and lower- fidelity SIBR. These aims will lay the groundwork for an initial multi-site R01 to
study SIBR in practice and a future R-level grant to implement and evaluate an optimized SIBR model. Through
this work, I will obtain formal training in HF outcomes research, advanced implementation science study designs,
and patient-oriented clinical research methods. I will be mentored by an expert team of NHLBI-funded
researchers, Bryan Weiner (primary mentor, implementation science), Randall Curtis (communication and
palliative care), Brenda Zierler (interprofessional collaboration and clinical pathways), and Kevin O'Brien
(advanced heart failure care). The combination of mentorship, coursework, and experiential learning will position
me to become an independent investigator using scientifically rigorous approaches to evaluate the
implementation and outcomes of evidence-informed patient- and family-centered models of care."
10906820,"Project Summary/Abstract
Non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PanNETs) are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms with increasing
incidence and ill-defined pathobiology. While many NF-PanNETs are indolent and remain stable for years, a significant
subset may behave aggressively and metastasize widely. Thus, the increasing and frequent detection of NF-PanNETs
presents a treatment dilemma. Current prognostic parameters and systems are susceptible to interpretation errors, sampling
issues, and do not accurately reflect the clinical behavior of these neoplasms. Hence, additional biomarkers are needed to
improve the prognostic stratification of patients with NF-PanNETs. Previously, we and others have reported recurrent
genomic alterations in ATRX and DAXX are associated with metastatic progression of NF-PanNETs. Mutations in these
genes result in loss of their respective proteins and coincide with the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a
telomerase-independent maintenance mechanism. We have also shown that loss of ATRX/DAXX and ALT correlate with
the development of metastases, are prognostic biomarkers for shorter disease-free survival and are independent of other
prognostic clinicopathologic parameters. Thus, ATRX/DAXX and ALT represent promising biomarkers. However, they
have not been evaluated prospectively nor in preoperative specimens, where prognostic stratification is important for patient
management. In addition, only 50% of metastatic NF-PanNETs harbor inactivation of ATRX/DAXX and the presence of
ALT. To identify additional biomarkers, we recently profiled ATRX/DAXX wild type metastatic NF-PanNETs and reported
recurrent alterations in SETD2/H3K36me3 and ARID1A, which similar to ATRX and DAXX are chromatin regulating genes.
We therefore hypothesize that the metastatic progression of NF-PanNETs is characterized by changes in chromatin
regulation and determining the key genomic and epigenomic hallmarks will not only improve the prognostic stratification
of patients with NF-PanNETs, but advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of this increasingly prevalent disease.
Aim 1 will be to develop and clinically validate preoperative prognostic biomarker assays for NF-PanNETs. Through both
retrospective and prospective studies, we will determine the prognostic performance and significance of ATRX, DAXX,
ALT, H3K36me3 and ARID1A. For Aim 2, we plan to define the chromatin patterns at different epigenetic states in the
metastatic progression of NF-PanNETs. Considering ATRX, DAXX, SETD2 and ARID1A are chromatin regulators, we will
evaluate the nanoscale chromatin structure and affected molecular pathways of various NF-PanNET states using
PathSTORM and CUT&RUN/RNA-seq assays. Finally, Aim 3 will investigate the adaptive response of ATRX/DAXX
inactivation and ALT initiation. We have discovered that the histone chaperone, HIRA, can reconstitute telomeric chromatin
and function of ATRX/DAXX deficiency ALT cancer cells. Within this aim, we will delineate the role of HIRA in regulating
telomeric integrity, chromatin and transcription. Overall, this proposal will lead to the development of a clinically available
assay for patient management, insight in the pathognomonic chromatin structural changes and identify novel
drivers/pathways for not only NF-PanNETs, but likely other ALT-associated neoplasms."
10828004,"Summary: Preterm infants have a significantly higher incidence of brain damage as a consequence of immature cerebral
blood flow (CBF) autoregulation. In contrast to term neonates, preterm neonates are not able to reduce CBF in response to
increased systemic BP. In preterm neonates, exposure of fragile cerebral vessels to an increased amount of blood flow at
elevated systemic pressure leads to their rupture and brain damage. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that near-term
fetuses and term-newborn lambs can constrict carotid arteries and reduce CBF when systemic BP rises; however, this
capability is not developed in the preterm fetus. Also, we observed that following the removal of sympathetic control in the
near-term fetus by severing the superior cervical ganglion made them lose their ability to restrict carotid blood flow to the
brain with the rise in systemic BP. We also observed that the constriction of carotid arteries to reduce CBF is regulated by
the sympathetic nervous system, specifically by the activity of alpha-1 adrenergic receptors (α1-ARs). These receptors are
expressed at a significantly lower number in preterm carotid arteries. Thus, we concluded that reduced activity of α1-ARs
plays a fundamental role in regulating carotid blood flow with the rise in systemic BP. Furthermore, we present evidence
that differential DNA methylation regulates α1-ARs promoter activity and expression. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that
DNA methylation and demethylation regulate the expression and function of α1-AR subtypes (α1A-, α1B-, α1D) in the carotid
arteries and play a crucial role in the maturation of CAR from preterm to term fetus. We will collect data from both sexes
to identify any sex-related changes. The studies will be conducted in-vivo in chronically catheterized fetal sheep and ex-vivo
on isolated carotid arteries. The hypothesis will be tested with two specific aims. Aim 1: From preterm to term fetus in a
sex-specific manner, we will conduct an in-depth mechanistic analysis of promoter DNA methylation on differential
expression of α1-AR subtypes in carotid arteries. Aim 2: In a sex-specific manner, we will determine the functional
significance of differential α1-AR subtypes promoter methylation and expression on carotid artery contractility and blood
flow. The measurements will be conducted in real-time, in-vivo, with in-utero fetal maturation. This will provide valuable
information regarding the role of α1-AR subtypes and the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the maturation of CAR."
10828005,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are a major source of respiratory morbidity, and as a group are the
leading indication for lung transplantation worldwide. Two particularly devastating ILD complications are
progressive lung fibrosis (Progressive ILD) and ILD-related pulmonary hypertension (ILD-PH). While effective
treatments are now available for both types of complications, there is a critical need to identify at-risk patients
before complications have already occurred and treatments become less effective.
 A known feature of pulmonary vascular disease is relative loss of the smaller vessels, referred to as
“pruning,” and vascular abnormalities are linked to both Progressive ILD and ILD-PH. Using advanced image
analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans, pruning can be quantified using existing imaging data – since
virtually all patients with ILD undergo CT scanning at the time of diagnosis, this could potentially lead to
widespread improvements in ILD risk stratification.
 The key focus of this project is to determine if pruning on CT can identify those at risk for Progressive
ILD and ILD-PH. This study will use both existing data from a cohort of highly characterized patients with ILD
from a sub-specialty clinic, and will also recruit a new prospective cohort to collect follow-up data related to ILD
outcomes. This proposal will combine advanced quantitative image analysis tools, rigorous epidemiologic
methods, and a comprehensive set of ILD-related outcome measures, including lung function testing, CT
imaging, exercise testing, survey scores, hemodynamic assessment, and review of clinical outcomes such as
hospitalization and death. The results of this study will help determine if CT pruning is a non-invasive marker of
high-risk ILD – which may potentially facilitate earlier and better treatment of ILD complications, thus
preventing morbidity and contributing to better long-term health for people with ILD.
 During this project, the candidate will develop advanced proficiency with quantitative vascular image
analysis techniques, learn critical new methodological skills, and obtain hands-on experience in the design and
execution of prospective studies. The candidate will be mentored by an outstanding, multidisciplinary team of
experts who will provide rigorous training, complemented by formal coursework, and personalized career
development support. The project takes place within an exceptional and unique institutional environment, and
leverages resources from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Chan School of Public Health,
Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Harvard Catalyst. The data, training,
and career development opportunities provided by this award will position the candidate to be a leader and
independent investigator in the application of chest imaging tools that will inform and improve the clinical care
of individuals with chronic lung disease."
10814369,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Each year over 4,000 children undergo tracheotomy and account for more than 20,000 hospitalizations
annually most commonly due to acute tracheostomy-associated respiratory infections (TARI). These
hospitalizations are most often due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Efforts to improve the care of
children with tracheostomy are challenged by the limited body of evidence on how patient factors, features of
P. aeruginosa itself, and the child's immune response impact the risk of recurrent infection. This proposal will
address this critical knowledge gap by identifying and characterizing prognostic factors for frequent
rehospitalization in children hospitalized for TARI. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award, Dr. John
Morrison will: 1) leverage existing data from a six-center prospective cohort study of children hospitalized for
TARI to identify clinical factors associated with recurrent TARI hospitalization; 2) prospectively determine the
association of pathogen-specific factors and features of the host immune response with frequency of recurrent
TARI hospitalization, and 3) derive a novel prognostic model incorporating clinical and molecular factors to
identify patients at increased risk for recurrent TARI hospitalization. Achieving these aims will facilitate Dr.
Morrison's long-term goal of leading prognostically-stratified interventional studies aimed at improving
outcomes for children with tracheostomy and others affected by frequent respiratory infections.
The applicant has dedicated his career to improving the care for children with chronic respiratory failure and
other medical complexity as a physician-scientist. He is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics with the Johns
Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital (JHACH) who seeks a
mentored career development award during which he will develop the advanced training, education, and
experience to become an independently funded investigator in biomarker-informed prognostic models and risk-
stratified clinical trials in children with tracheostomy. This proposal will provide Dr. Morrison with the support
needed to advance his career by 1) acquiring knowledge on the development and application of prognostic
modeling, 2) developing expertise in conducting biospecimen-based translational research, 3) preparing to
conduct a prospective, multicenter study validating a prognostic model and examining therapeutic strategies,
and 4) expanding his practical understanding of individual- and system-level factors contributing to recurrent
admissions among children with tracheostomy. Dr. Morrison will be supported by the extensive resources of
the Institutes for Clinical and Translational Research at JHACH and JHU and has assembled a strong team of
mentors with expertise in biomarker discovery, biomarker-informed prognostic modeling, and risk-stratified
clinical trials. He will also pursue coursework through the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health in
biostatistics, molecular epidemiology, and clinical trial conduct to complement his experience in the basic and
clinical sciences and acquire the skills necessary to transition to independence."

This K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award's overall goal is to develop and assess the feasibility and
preliminary efficacy of a web-based resilience-building intervention to address patients with advanced
cancer and their family caregivers’ appraisals of advance care planning (ACP) and individual and dyadic
coping. ACP is a process to facilitate decision-making for future medical care. By supporting individuals
in understanding and sharing their values and goals, ACP can help patients meet their goals for health
care treatment, decrease the emotional burden of decision-making for family caregivers, and increase
satisfaction with end-of-life care and quality of death. Avoidance of ACP can delay the introduction of
palliative and hospice care and risk patients receiving costly and aggressive care that not only is goal-
discordant but also increases family caregivers’ anxiety and depression. The rationale for a web-based
resilience-building intervention is that patients and family caregivers can be empowered to accurately
appraise and use appropriate coping strategies for ACP by increasing their resilience skills. Building
resilience has shown promising results in reducing cancer distress in adolescents and young adults with
cancer and their parents. The proposed study is guided by the Systemic Transactional Model and utilizes
a dyadic intervention approach. The training goals of the proposed study are to (1) develop expertise in
dyadic study design and intervention development for people with cancer and their caregivers; (2) gain
specialized knowledge in digital positive psychology interventions; (3) gain skills in leading randomized
controlled trials and dissemination and implementation science; and (4) secure a tenure-track position.
The Specific Aims for the K99 phase are to (1) identify the ACP deliberation process among 20 dyads of
patients with advanced cancer and family caregivers and (2) conduct usability testing among 9 dyads to
refine the content and design of the web-based resilience-building intervention. The Specific Aims for the
R00 phase are to (1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of the web-based resilience-building
intervention among patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers through a randomized
clinical trial in a cancer center setting; (2) evaluate the preliminary efficacy of the intervention compared
to usual care on changes in the completion of advance directives (primary outcome) and on patient and
caregiver resilience, individual and dyadic coping, anxiety, and depression (secondary outcomes); and
(3) explore the dyadic effects of resilience within patients with advanced cancer and their family
caregivers on individual and dyadic coping, anxiety, and depression, using the Actor-Partner
Interdependence Model. The expected outcomes are identification and development of the essential
components of the web-based intervention (K99 phase) and data that provides a strong foundation for
further development of the intervention for R01 applications and future research (R00 phase)."

Inflammation is a hallmark of alcohol-induced liver injury. Numerous studies established the role of the gut-to-
liver axis, but there is limited information on how the liver-to-gut axis contributes to inflammation and injury in
alcoholic liver disease. It is unknown whether ethanol-induced sterile damage-associated molecular patterns of
liver origin activate a proinflammatory program that, besides being detrimental to the liver, drive intestinal
barrier dysfunction, hence creating an amplifying proinflammatory feedback loop in alcoholic liver disease. Our
overarching goal is to dissect the pathogenic role of a protein complex of liver origin in regulating a
proinflammatory program that drives hepatic and intestinal injury in alcoholic liver disease.
In prior work, we demonstrated that high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) is a damage-associated molecular
pattern up-regulated in response to liver injury and participates in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease.
Interestingly, HMGB1 undergoes oxidation only in hepatocytes, and serum levels of oxidized HMGB1
([O]HMGB1) are increased in alcoholic patients. Our preliminary data demonstrate that blocking the production
of [O]HMGB1 in hepatocytes or ablating an HMGB1 receptor (the receptor for advanced glycation end-
products, RAGE) in myeloid cells prevents inflammation, hepatic injury, intestinal barrier dysfunction and
alcoholic liver disease. We show that Kupffer cells and infiltrated macrophages are the main hepatic source of
IL1β. Importantly, we reveal that [O]HMGB1 forms a complex with IL1β. This complex binds RAGE in Kupffer
cells and macrophages to produce a proinflammatory program and increases gut permeability in alcoholic liver
disease.
These encouraging data suggest that a proinflammatory feedback loop initiated by this complex, could
exacerbate hepatic and intestinal injury in alcoholic liver disease. However, key mechanistic aspects of how
this complex promotes the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease remain to be elucidated: 1) whether this
complex is of liver origin; 2) whether it is a ligand for RAGE; 3) the signals this complex conveys in Kupffer
cells and macrophages to induce a proinflammatory program that exacerbates hepatic injury; 4) whether it
alters tight junction protein expression in intestinal epithelial cells and increases intestinal barrier dysfunction;
and 5) whether the proinflammatory program itself also contributes to intestinal barrier dysfunction.
We propose a conceptually novel framework of a liver-to-gut proinflammatory feedback loop in alcoholic liver
disease. Our central hypothesis is that this complex is of liver origin and binds RAGE in Kupffer cells and
macrophages to induce a proinflammatory program that exacerbates hepatic injury. By binding RAGE in
intestinal epithelial cells and/or by inducing the proinflammatory program, this complex alters tight junction
protein expression and increases intestinal barrier dysfunction. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will identify the complex as being of liver origin. In Aim 2, we will determine the
complex binding affinity for RAGE in Kupffer cells and macrophages and identify the signals through which the
complex induces a proinflammatory program that exacerbates hepatic injury. In Aim 3, we will determine if the
complex alters tight junction protein expression and increases intestinal barrier dysfunction by binding RAGE in
intestinal epithelial cells and/or by inducing the proinflammatory program. Therefore, targeting this complex
could have significant therapeutic potential."

The vast majority of older adults undergo cataract surgery with 1-to-1 intraoperative monitoring and sedation
administered by an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist (a.k.a., “monitored anesthesia care” or “MAC”).
Proponents of MAC believe that cataract patients—many of whom are frail due to a combination of advanced
age, multimorbidity and underlying visual impairment—generally benefit from close intraoperative monitoring
by an anesthesia professional. However, given the procedure’s overall safety profile and the projected increase
in cataract surgery demand as the US population ages, policymakers, clinicians, and payers have questioned
whether the routine use of MAC for cataract surgery should continue in the US. Currently, there is inadequate
evidence to predict which patients would be at highest risk for harm if MAC were to be removed as a
component of routine cataract surgery. The rationale underlying the proposed research is that identifying the
characteristics of patients at highest risk of harm could help facilitate a careful transition to non-MAC cataract
surgery for the majority of patients who would be safe to proceed (and would not be harmed) without MAC.
The central hypothesis is that the provision of MAC is only necessary for a relatively small subset of high-risk
older adults undergoing cataract surgery. To test this hypothesis, the proposed research plan will investigate
three aims. Aim 1 will examine the relationship between frailty, MAC, and the incidence of adverse events after
cataract surgery through retrospective analysis of Medicare claims. Aim 2 will shed light on the facilitators and
barriers for performing cataract surgery without MAC using semi-structured interviews of ophthalmologists
whose practices represent a range of MAC utilization. Aim 3 will carry out a pilot study of low-risk older adults
undergoing cataract surgery to determine feasibility and acceptability of non-MAC sedation for cataract
surgery. These aims will create foundational knowledge to support future studies that can determine whether
MAC can safely be removed as a component of routine cataract surgery in low-risk older adults. The
Candidate is an anesthesiologist and health services researcher at UCSF. The Candidate, her mentors and
her scientific advisors have developed a comprehensive career development plan that aligns well with the
Aims of the proposed research. The key elements of this plan include training and didactics to obtain specialty
knowledge in the following areas: 1) Principles of geriatrics and gerontology, 2) Biostatistical methods for
advanced causal inference; 3) Introduction to qualitative research methodologies; 4) Implementation science
and feasibility pilot studies, and 5) Structured career development with exposure to thought leaders in
geriatrics, health services research, ophthalmology, and anesthesiology. This career development award will
help the Candidate achieve her goal of becoming a national leader in geriatric perioperative health services
research at the forefront of promoting evidence-based, high-value surgical and anesthetic care in older adults.
With strong institutional commitment, the Candidate is well-positioned to attain research independence."
10894290,"Treponema pallidum (Tp), Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), Leptospira interrogans (Li) and Treponema denticola (Td)
are spirochete bacteria that cause syphilis, Lyme disease, leptospirosis, and are associated with periodontal
diseases in humans, respectively. These organisms cause substantial morbidity and mortality in the United
States and throughout the world. Owing to the prevalence of Lyme disease and emergence of antibiotic
resistance in Tp and Td, our long-term goal is to develop novel drugs that specifically treat diseases
caused by spirochetes.
 Spirochetes are highly invasive bacteria, and their unique mode of motility plays an essential role in their ability
to penetrate and invade host tissues and organs. The flagella of spirochetes reside within the periplasm and are
thereby shielded from the immune system. A key component of bacterial flagella termed the hook joins the
flagella filament to the membrane-imbedded rotary motor. The hook consists of multiple FlgE proteins, and in
contrast to other bacterial flagella, spirochete FlgE proteins are covalently cross-linked to one another. This
cross-link involves formation of a novel lysinoalanine (Lal) amino acid. The central hypothesis is that the FlgE
proteins are covalently cross-linked to strengthen the hook for optimal motility and virulence. It is
proposed that understanding the structure of the cross-link, its chemical synthesis and its role in virulence will
lead to the development of drugs that inhibit cross-linking for treating spirochetal diseases.
Specific Aim 1. Investigate the effect of FlgE cross-linking on the infectivity of Bb. Mutants of Td and Bb
that are unable to cross-link their hook proteins are also altered in shape and deficient in translational motility.
To determine the importance of cross-linking for Bb virulence, we will produce a virulent strain impaired in FlgE
cross-linking and evaluate its ability to swim and sustain infections in both mice and ticks.
Specific Aim 2. Develop small molecule inhibitors of FlgE cross-linking. The chemistry of LA formation is
biologically unprecedented. Based on mechanistic and structural studies we have established cross-linking
assays with recombinant FlgE proteins from Td and Bb for large-scale inhibitor screens. With these assays we
have discovered an inhibitor of FlgE cross-linking and Bb motility. We will further characterize the action of this
compound and continue to identify and characterize additional classes of inhibitors to be used for studying
pathogenesis in hosts and eventually as lead compounds for therapeutics.
Specific Aim 3. Determine the effects of FlgE cross-linking on the structure and stability of the flagella
hook. To test whether the FlgE cross-links stabilize the hook to resist the high mechanical stress it likely
experiences in the periplasmic space, we will analyze the physical properties of cross-linked and non-cross-
linked hooks. In addition, the requirement of cross-linking will be tested by chemically restoring function in
absence of Lal."

CLM faculty provide the key elements for an innovative and active training program in learning and memory. The
CLM faculty represent a broad range of approaches to the mechanisms of learning and memory – from the
molecules of neural signaling and synaptic plasticity to cellular and systems level studies to functional
neuroimaging in humans. We will leverage the strengths of this collaborative faculty to provide structured training
in rigorous research design and methodologies, state-of-the-art quantitative approaches, and professional
development training activities to prepare graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to become innovative
leaders in the field of learning and memory research. The proposed training will support four predoctoral and two
postdoctoral trainees each year. Trainees are expected to be appointed to the training program for no more than
3 years before transitioning to individual grants and fellowships. The proposed training has four important
components. First, we will provide our trainees with hands-on instruction in the implementation of interdisciplinary
approaches to the study of learning and memory that cross levels of analysis. Second, we will provide extensive
training in advanced statistical and computational neuroscience methods that are increasingly necessary to
understanding the neural mechanisms that support learning and memory. Third, the proposed activities will
provide our trainees with the ability to place their research in a biomedical context, with an emphasis on the role
of learning and memory processes in disorders of mental health. Finally, the proposed activities and resources
provide our trainees with many opportunities for career development, including the skills necessary to obtain a
tenure track position (e.g., presentation and grant writing skills) as well as research-related careers outside of
academia. These components will prepare our trainees to be the next generation of leading-edge researchers
dedicated to understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of learning and memory and how they are impacted

10877739,"Regeneration is a remarkable phenomenon that is both ubiquitous and mysterious; although many different
animals are capable of replacing damaged and/or lost structures, it is unclear how these regenerative species
maintain both the cellular stability required for tissue integrity and the cellular plasticity needed to reactivate
tissue development upon injury. Moreover, as regeneration is often induced by spontaneous and imprecise
tissue damage, how do cells translate broad and sudden signals into cell-type-specific transcriptional changes?
 Genomic regulators such as transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes work together to
instruct cell fate during developmental processes. Although there is substantial data describing how these
factors orchestrate embryogenesis, much less is known about how they are activated to induce regeneration.
My central hypothesis is that chromatin serves as a mediator between the signaling events that are triggered
by significant tissue loss and the cellular changes they induce to activate regeneration. To uncover the
fundamental molecular mechanisms underlying this process, my laboratory studies the planarian model of
animal regeneration. Planarians are free-living flatworms with incredible regenerative capacities. They are also
amenable to genetic perturbation through RNAi, easily dissociated for single cell analyses, and encode
chromatin modifying proteins with strong homology to those in other organisms. We are particularly interested
in how some planarian cell types respond to injury by activating specific, essential, regeneration genes, while
others activate an entirely different set of loci in response to the same injury. My lab uses multiple customized
methods to isolate specific planarian cell types, both differentiated and stem cells, in order to characterize the
chromatin state of these cell types before and after injury. We also leverage data showing that RNAi depletion
of the MLL1/2 chromatin enzyme in the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea leads to loss of cilia on its outer
epithelium. In addition, we have recently isolated and characterized a new planarian species that has a unique
cilia pattern on its outer epithelium, providing an exciting opportunity to use comparative genomic approaches
to identify specific genes that are linked to this particular trait. Combining all these approaches, we aim to
dissect the functional role and molecular signaling cues contributed by specific cell types during regeneration.
 The outer epithelium and other differentiated tissues are essential for planarian regeneration in large part
because they signal to a population of heterogeneous multi and pluripotent stem cells that are maintained in
adult planarians. Because these stem cells must differentiate into all needed cell types in response to missing
tissue signals, it is not surprising that they are highly plastic and transcriptionally heterogeneous. Yet it is
unknown how they create and maintain this heterogeneity in vivo. We will test the hypothesis that a conserved
chromatin signature regulates this critical feature. These studies will uncover important mechanisms underlying
both regeneration and other biological processes that require dynamic gene regulation across complex tissues."

Project Summary/Abstract
Due to alarmingly low rates of exercise participation, children with physical disabilities are at substantially high
risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), related conditions, and CVD mortality as they age into adulthood.
Regular participation in aerobic exercise is an effective non-pharmaceutical method for preventing
cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome, but effective modalities such as walking, running, and cycling
are often not suitable for children with disabilities, who have impaired mobility. The growing availability of
internet access and acceptance of telehealth (due to the coronavirus pandemic) create an unprecedented
opportunity to engage large, underserved groups of children with disabilities in exercise behavior. However,
ensuring that they maintain regular participation over periods of time that are necessary to elicit changes in
cardiometabolic health will require enjoyable, accessible, and age-appropriate programs. This application
proposes a pilot project that builds upon our recent feasibility work. The project will pilot an evidence-based,
scale-up movement-to-music (M2M) program that has been newly revised for children with cerebral palsy who
have functional impairments. The program includes three novel components: 1) pre-recorded videos that are
stylized with visual graphics and enjoyable music to themes (e.g., superheroes, sports, pop music) that were
requested by our feasibility participants; 2) arm-based routines with sprint-intensity interval training (SIT),
based on principles from the latest exercise physiology research in the general population; and 3) replicable
cloud-based tele-monitoring procedures. Participants will be recruited from a children’s hospital and network of
community organizations. A total of 50 children with cerebral palsy will be randomized to one of two groups:
12 weeks of SIT-M2M or 12-week waitlist control that undergoes habitual activity before receiving SIT-M2M.
The SIT prescription will include 3 sessions per week of 30 repeated sequences of 4-s of maximal arm
exercise, with active recovery periods (~20-min sessions with a warm-up and cool down period). This study will
compare changes between groups in outcomes related to cardiovascular fitness and core indicators of
cardiometabolic health, namely, body composition, body weight, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, hemoglobin
A1c, triglycerides, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Additionally, the study will record implementation metrics
that will inform the design of a follow-up trial. Study findings will inform the development of a convenient
telehealth efficacy trial for implementation across various sites and settings to improve the health and well-
being of children with disabilities who cannot walk or stand for prolonged periods of time."

Genetic heritability incompletely explains amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and the pace of ALS genetic dis-
coveries has slowed, meaning entirely new research directions are needed to unravel disease mechanisms
and identify therapies. Our goal is to understand, cure, and prevent ALS. Our overall approach is to identify the
intersection of exposures, genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and inflammation on ALS.
Our rationale is that prior environmental risk scores (ERS) based on even crude plasma measures of limited
classes of pollutants associate with a 7-fold increase in ALS risk and 2-fold decrease in survival, therefore a
detailed understanding of the exposome with other omics can immediately provide new, much needed strate-
gies for both ALS treatment and prevention. We propose 3 aims: 1) comprehensively assess environmental
exposures and polygenic factors in ALS versus control subjects to identify synergistic environment-polygenic
associations that increase ALS risk; 2) define exposome signatures in the ALS epigenome, transcriptome, and
metabolome; and 3) determine how environmental exposures alter ALS immune profiles and identify drug tar-
gets. First, we account for the complex exposure data from self-reports, geospatial analysis, and biospecimens
using component-ERS (cERS) for specific exposure types (e.g. pesticides, metals, air pollution) and a poly-
ERS for combined exposures. We account for genetic risk using polygenic risk scores (PRS) and C9ORF72
status. We will build ALS risk and prediction models based on ERS and PRS. Next, using cERS, poly-ERS,
and PRS, we determine the environmental signature on the DNA methylome, mRNA and microRNA, to identify
exposures that associate with differentially expressed genes and target pathways. Expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTL) analyses will define the relative contribution of polymorphisms vs exposures on gene expression.
High resolution untargeted metabolomics will reveal the environmental signature of the ALS metabolome and
identify new toxicants. All datasets will be integrated using pan-omics techniques to identify gene-metabolite
networks that are disease targets. Finally, we will classify immune profiles that associate with cERS and poly-
ERS to identify therapeutic targets using existing FDA approved drugs. Our proposal is highly innovative; it de-
fines for each patient, (i) their exposome, summarized with cERS/poly-ERS; (ii) their genome summarized by
PRS and its association with ERS to understand the combined gene/environment risk; (iii) their multi-omic en-
vironmental signatures from the epigenome, transcriptome, metabolome, and inflammasome; (iv) their dysreg-
ulated pathways, ranked by their association to ALS risk and progression to identify personalized mechanism-
based drug-targets; and (v) ALS prediction models and preventative strategies via risk factor modification. Our
parallel, multi-omics approach is significantly faster than serial, single-toxicant/omic approaches, and its inte-
grated nature captures the full spectrum of omics intersections, accelerating scientific discovery. We will make
significant strides in finding completely new therapeutic targets and public health preventative strategies."

Currently, over 30% of all new HIV infections globally are estimated to occur among youth ages 15 to 25 years.
Adolescent girls are at very high risk of getting infected. This pattern is especially clear in sub-Saharan Africa,
the region most severely affected by HIV/AIDS. Also, increasingly, children infected at birth grow into
adolescents who have to deal with their HIV positive status. Combining the two, there are 5 million youth living
with HIV(WHO). There is a global call to focus on the particular needs of youth. Youth living with HIV comprise
two different sub-populations: those who are infected through sexual exposure (behaviourally infected yBHIV)
and those infected through parent-to-child transmission (perinatally infected yPHIV), now surviving into young
adults. Adolescence represents a critical period of brain maturation, with ongoing myelination, cortical growth
and synaptic pruning. Gradual and differential maturation of the limbic system and prefrontal cortex modulates
reward and affective behavior, and executive control. Substance use and HIV infection present further
challenges to neurodevelopment and resilience in this vulnerable stage of development.
Few studies have investigated substance use outcomes in yBHIV, or made direct comparisons by mode of
infection. Studies which conflate yHIV by mode of infection may blur the substance use experiences of these
two different sub-populations. The proposed study will elucidate mechanisms of substance induced
neuroimmune dysfunction in youth living with HIV-1 (yHIV), who are on anti-retroviral therapy (ART), and will
include youth between the ages of 15 and 21 yrs, including 200 yPHIV + 100 yBHIV + 100 healthy controls in
Cape Town, South Africa. The proposed study will to follow an existing cohort of yHIV from Cape Town
Adolescent Antiretroviral Cohort (CTAAC), into early adulthood in order to understand the individual and
combined effects of substance use (SU) and HIV infection on brain structure and function, neurocognitive
functioning and mental health. The long-term goal is to understand the drivers (structural/mental
health/cognitive) of SU in youth living with HIV (yHIV) and the impact of SU on chronic HIV infection and
general health including immune dysregulation, viral reservoir and other health outcomes measured in the
CTAAC parent award, such as the stool microbiome, respiratory and cardiac function. The Cape Universities
Body Imaging Centre (CUBIC) houses a state-of-the-art research-dedicated Siemens 3 T Skyra MRI scanner
optimized for brain imaging, and unique in sub-Saharan Africa. We have developed the capability for advanced
brain morphometry, spectroscopy, diffusion tensor and functional imaging. This project builds on existing
successful collaborations."
10898768,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Clinical islet transplantation is a promising treatment for insulin-dependent diabetic patients, with the
potential to eliminate long-term secondary complications by restoring native insulin signaling. While clinical
successes have demonstrated the feasibility of achieving insulin independence through islet replacement
therapy, the necessity of a long term immunosuppressive regimen limits the widespread applicability of this
procedure, as the substantial risk associated with chronic immunosuppression outweighs the risk of diabetes
associated morbidities. As a result, much research has explored the development of macroencapsulation
devices to isolate transplanted cells from the recipient immune system. To date, these devices demonstrate
limited clinical efficacy, due in large part to limited oxygen delivery to encapsulated cells.
 In previous work, we demonstrated the use of vasculogenic degradable hydrogels to enhance
vascularization, and therefore oxygenation, at the surface of macroencapsulation devices. Despite improved
vascularization, non-ideal device geometry limits encapsulated cell viability and function in vivo, as indicated by
in silico modeling of device oxygenation. As such, we seek to approach macroencapsulation device design using
computational modeling to optimize device oxygen distribution prior to fabrication and testing, and evaluate
device oxygenation in vitro and in vivo via a novel, siloxane probe-based magnetic resonance (MR) oximetry
technique, originally developed by co-PI Dr. Vikram Kodibagkar for cancer applications.
 We hypothesize that MR oximetry, via siloxane core probe device labelling, will enable the first precise
tracking and evaluation of macroencapsulation device oxygenation in a spatiotemporal manner. We anticipate
that MR imaging will validate in silico finite element modeling predictions of oxygen distribution within varied
macroencapsulation device designs, and enable non-invasive, real-time tracking of macroencapsulation device
oxygenation levels in vivo.
 These hypotheses will be addressed in the experiments of the following Specific Aims: (1) to validate in
silico-optimized macroencapsulation device oxygen gradients via MR oximetry in vitro; (2) to use non-invasive
MR oximetry to evaluate in vivo oxygenation of macroencapsulated cell grafts in real time; and (3) use MR
oximetry to evaluate macroencapsulation devices scaled to a larger rodent model. We anticipate that this study
will enable the design of improved macroencapsulation devices that significantly enhance encapsulated cell
survival and function in vivo. This approach to device design, validation, and in vivo evaluation may also facilitate
the process of device scale-up, potentially streamlining the process of macroencapsulation device translation to
the clinic."
10883667,"Despite the widespread use of an attenuated vaccine and several antibiotics, tuberculosis (TB) continues to be
a global public health problem. Over 1.2 million people died from TB in 2019. This dire situation is compounded
by increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the main
etiological agent of human TB. Central to Mtb success is its ability to evade, modulate, and even manipulate
host immune defense response. Consequently, bacterial factors involved in undermining the immune system
are potentially good targets for TB intervention.
Like many other bacteria, Mtb actively produces extracellular vesicles (EVs) in vitro and in vivo. These are
membrane enclosed spherical structures that allow the bacteria to concentrate and secrete a variety of
molecules, and communicate with other cells in their environment. The release of EVs by Mtb infecting
macrophages enables the delivery of pathogenicity factors and immunomodulatory molecules into the host cell,
and the extracellular milieu. Strong evidence from in vitro studies indicates that EVs may allow Mtb to remotely
influence bystander immune cells. However, the limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved
in vesicle biogenesis, and the lack of mutants deficient in vesicle production have impeded progress in
elucidating the relevance of vesicle secretion to Mtb virulence. Our preliminary work identified the dynamin-like
proteins (DLP) of Mtb as essential factors for efficient EVs release and characterized a DLP mutant deficient in
vesicle biogenesis. We are now well positioned to dissect DLP's function in vesicle formation and assess the
role of EV production during infection, using a mouse model of TB; those are the main goals of this proposal.
We anticipate the findings will advance the TB field by highlighting ways to target vesicle release, or disrupt the
effects of vesicles in host-resistance to TB."
10864817,"Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT) is a potentially curative therapy used to treat several
malignant diseases, of which the most frequent is acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As many as half of the ~8,000
aHSCTs performed in the U.S. each year will result in GVHD, thus graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving aHSCTs. Pre-transplant conditioning, including
irradiation and chemotherapy for hematological tumors, causes widespread death of dividing cells, release of
endogenous danger signals, and bacterial translocation due to gastrointestinal (GI) epithelial barrier dysfunction.
These events promote the generation of a pro-inflammatory cytokine storm mediated by the activation of innate
immune sensors which drives the differentiation and expansion of allo-reactive donor T cells. Activated donor
anti-host T cells can then damage particular recipient tissues characteristic of GVHD, as well as mediate anti-
tumor immunity targeted to both allogeneic and tumor-antigens. My previous findings demonstrate that
Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), an innate immune sensor, promotes inflammation and GVHD following
conditioning and MHC-matched murine aHSCT. The benefit of receiving an aHSCT is the accompanying “graft-
versus-leukemia” (GVL) response, mediated by donor T/NK cells to target and eradicate residual disease.
Therefore, primary objectives of the F99 phase of this proposal are to identify how the STING pathway affects
pre-clinical GVL responses, and if reduced GVHD in the absence of recipient STING can promote tumor
vaccination strategies. Other strategies to reduce inflammatory responses to pre-transplant conditioning include
the development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, which are less toxic than traditional
chemoradiotherapy and lower the risks of both transplant-related mortality and GVHD but are limited in use due
to the significantly increased risk of relapse after RIC. Since the median age of diagnosis for AML - the most
frequent indication for aHSCT - is 68, frailty and the frequency of co-morbidities associated with elevated age
often precludes the use of toxic myeloablative conditioning (MAC) regimens in many aHSCT recipients. As a
result, studies during the K00 phase of this proposal will determine if multiple pre-clinical RIC regimens are
associated with decreased activation of innate immune sensors, reduced GVHD and improved immune
reconstitution after murine aHSCT. Experiments will also determine if prophylactic post-transplant antileukemic
strategies targeting residual AML promotes comparable or improved anti-tumor immunity after RIC versus MAC.
The studies in this proposal will provide new information regarding the involvement of STING and other innate
sensors in the context of aHSCT. The long-term objective of my studies will be to develop new therapies that
can be translated into the clinic to prevent or reduce GVHD without diminishing GVL, thereby increasing the
overall number of potential transplant recipients to augment the use of aHSCT."
10870069,"SUMMARY
The prevalence of extreme obesity in adults is increasing precipitously and today more than one-third (39.8%)
of adults are obese. Furthermore, the obese condition is characterized by responses and hormone levels that
encourage the accumulation of more fat. Obese individuals are resistant to the appetite suppressing actions of
leptin and to glucose regulation by leptin and they secrete reduced levels of the lipolytic hormone, growth
hormone (GH) from anterior pituitary (AP) somatotropes. There are significant gaps in knowledge about
mechanisms behind the suppression in GH secretion. In light of the importance of somatotropes as metabolic
sensors and the need for their production of GH, there is a critical need to improve our understanding of
somatotrope responses to the stress of obesity. Like all AP cells, somatotropes display plasticity as they are
remodeled to meet fluctuating hormonal and gender-specific needs of the body. Leptin may directly modulate
somatotrope plasticity, although mechanisms are unknown. Furthermore, the impact of leptin is broad in that
it impacts AP cell maturation. The long-term goal of this laboratory is to elucidate the mechanisms by which
AP cells are regulated in order to respond appropriately to metabolic signals. The specific objectives with the
studies described in this application are to determine the mechanisms by which leptin signals somatotropes,
including the identification of gene expression changes and remodeling that occurs under conditions of diet
induced obesity (DIO). This proposed study will test the central hypothesis that the obese state causes sex-
specific somatotrope dysfunction and compromises responses to environmental stresses. A
secondary hypothesis is that post-transcriptional regulation plays a key role in facilitating AP
remodeling. Aim 1 studies will determine the impact of obesity and recovery to normal weight
on somatotrope remodeling and plasticity. Mice will be subject to diet-induced obesity (DIO) under
thermoneutral conditions and a second cohort of animals will recover normal weight after DIO. Unbiased and
targeted approaches including miRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq), single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and
multiplex protein assays will identify signaling pathway mediators and AP cellular response patterns. Aim 2
studies will ascertain the impact of obesity on somatotrope responses to stress. DIO mice will be
challenged with hypothermia and responses assessed by miRNA-seq and scRNA-seq. Aim 2 will also test the
impact of DIO and environmental stress on mice lacking the translational regulatory protein, Musashi in
somatotropes. This study addresses the biological mechanisms regulating energy balance at the level of the AP
and will clarify how somatotropes are remodeled to respond to the metabolic stress of obesity in a sex-specific
manner. The introduction of targeted and unbiased state-of-the-art technologies presents a unique opportunity
for broader mechanistic insights that are critical to identify targets for therapeutic intervention in the obese
state."

 Despite decades of research into targeted therapeutics, the most effective treatments in glioma remain DNA
damaging agents: radiation and the alkylating agents temozolomide and nitrosureas like CCNU. In this project’s
prior cycle, we found that mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) is a common source of temozolomide resistance;
and that unlike other cancers, gliomas that gain temozolomide resistance through MMRd tend not to respond to
immune checkpoint inhibition. But they often do respond to CCNU. We hypothesize that a fuller understanding
of the different resistance mechanisms to TMZ and CCNU will enable 1) improved knowledge of when and how
to use these agents, including clinically useful biomarkers, and 2) optimization of combined strategies using
targeted and immunotherapies developed over the last decade.
 Although extensive work has been done to understand how CCNU damages DNA and to detect genes and
pathways involved in repairing this damage, the field lacks a unified understanding of how CCNU effects vary
across gliomas with different DNA damage response (DDR) characteristics, how resistance arises, and how the
effects of CCNU interact with other agents including DNA damaging agents such as temozolomide and radiation,
as well as therapeutics targeting specific DDR functions and pathways. As a result, we lack biomarkers that can
accurately guide clinicians to prescribe CCNU to patients who are likely to respond, do not know the optimal
combined therapeutic approaches involving CCNU, and clinical practice varies widely.
 We propose to pursue a systematic evaluation of the genomic effects and potential therapeutic roles of
CCNU. A major innovation in our proposal is our systematic approach to evaluating the effects of CCNU on
cancer survival and proliferation and genome integrity: when used alone and in combination with temozolomide,
RT, and agents targeting DNA damage response pathways; and across a wide variety of DNA damage response
contexts. For this, we will leverage a living tissue biobank of over 250 gliomas in vivo and in vitro models and
state-of-the-art technologies for functional genomics and genome characterization across treatment conditions
and DDR backgrounds. Our Aims are: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that MMRd based resistance to TMZ within a
GBM indicates relative sensitivity to CCNU and RT and can be detected through plasma cell-free DNA. Aim 2:
Test the hypothesis that defects in proteins involved in repair of CCNU-induced ICLs determine resistance to
CCNU and strategies to overcome. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that intentional manipulation of mutational profiles
and clonal dynamics by coordinating TMZ, CCNU, RT, and DDR pathway inhibition can increase the
effectiveness of immunotherapy. DNA damaging agents remain the most effective agents in glioma and all other
cancers, the unified understanding of their effects in isolation and combination across the varied DDR contexts
in this proposal will shape the use of these agents in clinical practice and guide the development of new
biomarker-driven combinations with novel DDR targets."
10848423,"ABSTRACT
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular (ccc) DNA plays a central role in the establishment of viral
infection and persistence, and is the basis for viral rebound after the cessation of therapy, as well as the
elusiveness of a cure even after extended treatment with current approved medications. HBV cccDNA is
established upon initial infection through conversion of the partially double stranded relaxed circular (rc) DNA
viral genome containing terminal peculiarities, through employment of the host cell’s DNA repair mechanisms
in the nucleus. The cccDNA episome levels are maintained through a replication cycle that involves
retrotranscription of a cccDNA transcript, termed pregenomic RNA, into progeny rcDNA genomes, some of
which are returned to the nucleus for conversion into cccDNA. The conversion of rcDNA into cccDNA requires
the removal of a covalently-linked copy of the polymerase from the 5’ end of one of the DNA strands, and this
“deproteination” step generates a DNA intermediate, the deproteinated rcDNA (DP-rcDNA), as precursor for
cccDNA formation. The rcDNA deproteination is a trigger signal for transportation of HBV nucleocapsid
containing mature viral DNA into nucleus, where the rcDNA to cccDNA conversion takes place. We have
recently mapped the termini of cytoplasmic DP-rcDNA, which demonstrated that the viral polymerase and RNA
primer are completely removed from rcDNA during deproteination, the plus strand DNA is further elongated but
the terminal redundant sequence is maintained on DP-rcDNA. In addition, recent studies by us and others
have identified a handful of host DNA repair factors involved in cccDNA formation. However, there are many
molecular details yet to be elucidated for a better understanding of cccDNA biosynthesis, and the
establishment of immunocompetent small animal model for HBV infection is hampered by the inability of
cccDNA formation in mouse hepatocyte. In this research application, by making use of a battery of molecular
biology, biochemistry, proteomics and genomics technologies, we propose to further elucidate the molecular
mechanisms underlying the biogenesis of DP-rcDNA (Aim 1) and cccDNA (Aim 2), and to define the host
determinant(s) for the failure of cccDNA formation in mouse hepatocyte (Aim 3). Our ultimate goal is to
illustrate a coherent picture of the molecular mechanisms/pathway for HBV cccDNA formation. The
accomplishment of this project will reveal new potential antiviral targets for treatment of hepatitis B and aid the
development of a mouse model fully susceptible to HBV infection."

We propose a novel NIAMS doctoral T32 Program, Regenerative Engineering of Musculoskeletal
Tissues: A Convergence Doctoral Training Program, which offers inter-disciplinary research areas at
the University of Connecticut (UConn) combining biomedical science and engineering faculties.
Regenerative Engineering is defined as the Convergence of advanced materials science, stem cell
science, physics, developmental biology and clinical translation for the regeneration of complex tissues
and organ systems. The T32 Program will enroll 3 Ph.D. candidates per year and support each for 2
years of Graduate School. The students will be drawn from graduate programs at UConn (School of
Medicine and School of Engineering). The students will then apply for T32 support at the end of Year
1 of graduate school to be supported for Years 2-3. They will all receive their Ph.D. from the Graduate
School at UConn. The T32 Program will offer trainees a broad level of expertise in research and
instruction based on the research, educational, and clinical experiences of the biomedical and
engineering faculty who serve as preceptors. Trainees will become experts in regenerative engineering
and its foundations to work towards the alleviation of human disease and musculoskeletal injuries by
means of tissue regeneration. Musculoskeletal regeneration is a field ripe for an inventive approach
based on convergence to address challenging issues, advance technology and further fundamental
knowledge for therapeutic applications. At the center of the Convergence approach is the
understanding that new solutions in regeneration will take place through an `un-siloed' approach. Thus,
Regenerative Engineering welcomes ideas and research across a gamut of disciplines. The T32
Program has preceptorship commitments from 20 distinguished faculty at UConn (representing
Biomedical Engineering, Cell Biology, Computer Science, Genetics and Genome Sciences, Materials
Science, Mechanical Engineering, Molecular Biology and Biophysics, Oral Health, Orthopedic
Surgery). This eminent group of investigators is well funded and published to provide the primary
research training and serve as role models for doctoral trainees. The T32 Program goals are to
educate, support and enhance the training of individuals dedicated to careers as independent clinical
translational and basic scientists in regenerative engineering. Our Program strengths include its
interdisciplinary and collaborative research in biomedical science and engineering, interactions with
diverse trainees and faculty, training in contemporary research methodologies, and successful
preceptors. T32 Program administration through the Connecticut Convergence Institute for Translation
in Regenerative Engineering will provide the experience to recruit diverse trainees, including
minorities, implement the curriculum, and train a new cadre of convergence scientists."
10886096,"Project Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and deadliest primary brain tumor in adults. Recent work continues to
support the idea that this cancer (like many others) echoes the proliferation and differentiation programs from
earlier developmental stages. The possibility that neurological cancers like GBM are essentially `locked in' to a
developmental program and retain the controls that instruct these cell populations during development opens
new and exciting opportunities. Furthermore, it places an emphasis on the need to identify the molecular triggers
that govern the transition of immature progenitor cells to quiescent mature astrocytes during development.
In this project we will test the hypothesis that master transcriptional regulators are sufficient for driving astrocyte
maturation and that these factors can be used to jump-start stalled maturation within GBM-astrocytes. The ability
of individual or small groups of transcription factors to drive cell fate or maturation changes has been
demonstrated in a variety of cell types, including neurons and glia. To begin, we used existing transcriptomic,
epigenomic, and DNA-binding data to identify a targeted set of candidate transcription factors that we
hypothesize catalyze the astrocyte maturation process. We will test whether these transcription factors are
capable of inducing precocious maturation in immature human astrocytes by manipulating their expression using
schemes that mirror their developmental activity. As a model system, we are using human iPSC-derived cortical
organoids, which provides a multicellular platform in which astrogenesis and maturation occurs endogenously
along a timescale analogous to what is observed in the fetal and early postnatal human brain.
We will also ask how the developmental trajectory of astrocyte maturation is perturbed in the setting of GBM by
comparing epigenomic profiles of maturing human astrocytes from the organoid system with single cell data from
surgical GBM resections. This comparison will place GBM-astrocyte differentiation in the context of the normal
developmental trajectory and reveal potential transcription factors whose absence may contribute to stalled
maturation. An important possibility in the pathobiology of gliomagenesis is that the heterogeneous mutations
accumulated within GBM-astrocytes render them unreceptive to maturation-inducing transcription factors. Thus,
in a final set of experiments, we will use isogenic iPSC lines harboring driver GBM mutations to test their influence
on the receptivity to maturation-inducing transcription factors. Together, these studies will help teach us how and
where GBM cells are stalled in their developmental programs and offer novel avenues to pursue differentiation
schemes to mitigate these deadly tumors."
10868601,"Nearly one in five human proteins are post-translationally lipidated, and while the critical role of post-
translational modification in regulating different facets of cell biology (e.g., signaling, membrane localization,
etc.) has been well established, many mechanistic questions remain unanswered. These include the effects of
lipidation on the energetics, conformations, and function of lipidated proteins (LP) — and on human diseases.
Advancing our understanding of protein lipidation at the biophysical level and elucidating the sequence–
structure–function rules in various biological milieus, require study of the changes in protein structure and
conformation as the physicochemistry of lipid, lipidation site, and proteins are systematically modified.
However, such efforts have been stymied by the challenging and laborious methods to synthesize lipid-
modified proteins. To advance understanding of protein lipidation, my program will genetically engineer
prokaryotes to incorporate a diverse set of lipids into proteins, enabling the rapid generation of comprehensive
libraries of model LPs with broad physicochemical diversity. The overarching hypothesis of this program is that
the biophysical consequences of protein lipidation is governed by a “molecular syntax”, which is based on the
interplay between the physicochemistry of the lipid, protein, and the lipidation site that (de)stabilizes folding or
assembly of intermediates via (non)native interactions between lipid, protein sidechains, and the aqueous
milieu. To test this hypothesis, diverse and complementary biophysical and soft-matter characterization
techniques will be used to (1) study the tertiary structure and quaternary organization of model globular and
disordered LPs across three distinct structural hierarchies—single protein chains, lipid-driven supramolecular
assemblies, and liquid-liquid phase separation-driven higher-order assemblies (condensates); and (2) quantify
the contribution of these structures and the LP’s physicochemistry to encoded functional/material properties
such as biomolecular switching, viscoelasticity, and contact mechanics. By establishing platforms to engineer
sequence-defined LPs and revealing a rigorous, biophysically rooted molecular syntax underlying their
structure and energetics, this research program will substantially broaden the design space and functional
landscape of biomolecules beyond protein’s amino acid-based motifs. Ultimately, this program will enable a
better understanding of the role of LPs in diverse biological mechanisms in health and disease, and the
development of materials and therapeutics with complex structural and functional properties whose capabilities
rival natural biosystems for wide applications in nanomedicine and biotechnology."
10810825,"Project Summary/Abstract
The sense of taste starts with taste buds, clusters of sensory cells, that communicate chemosensory
information to afferent neurons whose cell bodies are located in the geniculate and nodose/petrosal ganglia.
Geniculate ganglion (GG) oral sensory neurons project via the chorda tympani (CT) nerve to innervate taste
buds located in fungiform papillae that are distributed across the anterior tongue. Importantly, fungiform
papillae are multimodal in that CT nerve fibers respond to all five taste qualities, tactile stimulation of the
tongue surface, and temperature. Our understanding of the different subtypes of sensory neurons that
communicate these varied stimuli to the brain, and their role in feeding and the perception of flavor, is
rudimentary. Likewise, the molecular mechanisms responsible for cell fate specification of these GG oral
sensory subpopulations, and the maintenance of their functional connections throughout life, are poorly
understood. Neurotrophic factor signaling pathways, along with downstream transcription factors, are critical
for the emergence of neuronal diversity in other sensory systems. To identify cell fate specification pathways in
the taste system, we used ribosomal profiling to identify genes that were enriched specifically in GG oral
sensory neurons. From this screen we identified the growth factor receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK),
which is expressed in other visceral neurons such as sympathetic neurons. We also identified the transcription
factor early growth response 4 (EGR4), and both ALK and EGR4 were confirmed to be expressed in GG oral
sensory neurons. We will test the hypothesis that the ALK receptor complex is required for oral sensory neuron
differentiation, target innervation and maintenance throughout the lifespan by examining Alk-/- mice. We will
also determine whether whether Alk-/- mice, as compared to Alk+/+ mice, have impaired responses to chemical
and tactile stimulation of the tongue using electrophysiological recordings of the CT. Likewise, the function of
EGR4 in the cell fate specification of geniculate oral sensory neurons will be evaluated through the analysis of
Egr4-/- mice. Whether Egr4-/- mice have impaired CT responses to taste and tactile stimulation of the tongue
will be evaluated, along with whether BDNF, a neurotrophic factor critical for the development of GG neurons,
is the signal that initiates EGR4 expression. Lastly, we identified a population of GG oral sensory neurons that
are mechanosensory and selectively express the receptor Ret. Using intersectional genetics, we will
distinguish Ret+ GG neuron projections in fungiform papillae from intermingled trigeminal projections. We will
also determine which Ret ligands support the innervation pattern of these oral mechanosensory neurons.
Linking this subpopulation to cell fate pathways, we will determine whether the emergence of Ret+ GG
neurons requires EGR4 and/or ALK complexes. These experiments will provide a greater understanding of the
organization and maintenance of the peripheral gustatory system, and may reveal therapeutic strategies for
taste impairments caused by neurodegerative disorders, cancer treatments, viral infections and aging."
10886731,"Potassium channels control membrane potential and signaling processes for humans and pathogens. Essentially all
characterized K+ channels inactivate after opening due to a transmembrane allosteric process that appears to be a
slow result of activation and involves residues near the selectivity filter in the pore domain (c-type inactivation). Since
the activated state is the only conductive species, and is metastable, inactivation controls mean open time and
thereby modulates function
for many important channels and drug targets. For example, neurons use K+ channel
inactivation kinetics to modulate their firing frequency, and inactivation kinetics in the channels of the human heart
have strong effects on heart timing. Our research provided evidence in the K+ channel KcsA that the molecular basis of
c-type inactivation is transmembrane allosteric coupling between the activation gate (H+ binding to the intracellular pH
sensor) and the inactivation gate (K+ release from the extracellular selectivity filter). In recent efforts, we have delineated
the mechanism for transmembrane allosteric control of channel activity by identifying residues that serve important roles
in the allosteric response using NMR chemical shifts and mutation. We showed that activation and opening directly lead to
K+ loss in the selectivity filter for wild type, but not for inactivation-reduced mutants, for which thermodynamic coupling
between opening and K+ affinity is reduced. Our studies use solid state NMR measurements on full-length wild-type
channels in hydrated proteoliposomes and offer atomistic access to structure, as well as the dynamics and
thermodynamics of ligand binding. Thus, studies in the last period offer support for the hypothesis that allosteric coupling
between activation and inactivation is the basis for inactivation and channel timing. The studies also give support for the
specific identities of the “hotspots”. (Aim 1) In the upcoming period, a definitive test will be based on mutants that are
accelerated in inactivation, in the sense that these mutants increase the “timing” function rather than abolish it. Many of
these faster-inactivating mutants are also of interest because of similarities or analogies to eukaryotic channels that are
fast-inactivating. (Aim 2) We plan to probe the conformational dynamics of the activated open state of the channel with
recently developed NMR methods, to identify spontaneous conversion to early intermediates of inactivation. Specific
methods developed in the last period allow us to carry out studies of the dynamics of key carbonyl and aromatic groups.
Recent breakthroughs in the sensitivity of solid state NMR methods will be harnessed so that controls can be performed
to test hypothesized relationships between dynamics and function, for example from molecular dynamics simulations.
(Aim 3) Finally, in Ktr, a related channel that has been identified as a drug target for many pathogenic bacteria, we plan to
clarify ligand-channel interactions determining the binding location of promising lead compounds. We will also
characterize the inactivation mechanism and determine the consequence to allostery, inactivation and function when
ligands bind. A clearer understanding of the thermodynamics and dynamics in these exemplars of transmembrane
allostery is likely to lead to clarification of broad biophysical principles, as well as specific insights into small molecule
modulators of disease-related channel function."
10930837,"The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is one of the three opioid receptors. KOR agonists produce analgesic and
anti-pruritic effects, but their development for clinical use has been limited by side effects, most importantly
dysphoria and psychotomimesis. KOR antagonists display antidepressant- and anti-anxiety-like effects in
rodents and may be useful for the treatment of drug addiction in humans. The paraventricular nucleus of the
thalamus (PVT), the most dorsal nucleus of the thalamic midline nuclei, is among the brain regions that
express high levels of KOR. The PVT receives inputs from the prelimbic, infralimbic and insular cortices, the
ventral subiculum and many hypothalamic and brain stem nuclei. The PVT sends dense projections to several
limbic structures including the amygdala, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and the core and shell of the
nucleus accumbens. The PVT is part of the brain anxiety network and is involved in stress responses, fear,
anxiety, arousal, reward, and homeostasis. The KOR level in the PVT is similar to that in the ventral tegmental
area, but KOR in the PVT has not yet been characterized. For the proposed studies, we have generated a
mutant mouse line expressing tamoxifen-inducible Cre conjugated to KOR (KOR-iCre). In this application, we
propose the following three specific aims. For the Aim 1, the origins of afferent projections to PVT KOR-
expressing neurons will be determined by Cre-dependent rabies virus-mediated monosynaptic retrograde
tracing. The brain regions of efferent projections of PVT KOR-expressing neurons will then be characterized
using Cre-dependent anterograde tracing. Whether KOR+ neurons in the PVT projecting to different brain
regions receive innervations from different brain areas will also be investigated. Finally, the origin of dynorphin
inputs into the PVT will be explored. For the Aim 2, we will elucidate the functions of PVT KOR by examining
the effects of conditional deletion of PVT KOR on behaviors such as KOR agonist-induced analgesia in a
visceral pain model, conditioned place aversion, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal signs, aversion after chronic
morphine and anxiety-like behaviors. For the Aim 3, we will examine the roles of PVT KOR-expressing neurons
in stress-related behaviors, fear conditioning and aversion by activation and inhibition of these neurons via
chemogenetic approaches. This will be the first time that these PVT KOR-expressing neurons and KOR per se
are investigated in a comprehensive manner. Determining the neuronal circuitries in which the KOR is involved
and the functional significance of KOR+ circuits will enhance our understanding of KOR functional
neuroanatomy and KOR-mediated aversion, anxiety, stress responses and other psychopathology. The
knowledge acquired may provide the neuronal basis for developing KOR antagonists as anti-anxiety agents."
10914136,"Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning remains a major cause of death and disability, affecting 50,000 persons each
year in the U.S. alone. Patients removed from fires or following exposure to car and home generator exhaust
are placed on 100% oxygen and transferred to a facility with a hyperbaric oxygen delivery system. Despite the
availability of hyberbaric therapy centers, inherent delays in access to and initiation of therapy greatly limit
efficacy. Even with hyberbaric oxygen therapy, 1-2% of patients die and >25% of surviving patients exhibit
neurocognitive impairments. There is currently no point-of-care antidote for CO poisoning available clinically.
In our initial work we discovered a surprising and near-irreversible CO-binding affinity of mutationally engineered
human neuroglobin (Ngb). Ngb is a six-coordinate hemoprotein, with the heme iron coordinated by two histidine
residues. We mutated the distal histidine to glutamine (H64Q) and three surface-thiols to form a five-coordinate
heme protein (Ngb-H64Q-CCC) that has very high solubility (>10mM), allowing for high concentration and
intravenous infusion. This molecule binds CO ≈ 500 times more strongly than Hb. Infusions of Ngb-H64Q-CCC
in CO-poisoned mice enhanced CO removal from red blood cells in vivo from 25 minutes to 25 seconds, restored
heart rate and blood pressure, increased survival from less than 10% to over 85%, and were followed by rapid
renal elimination of CO-bound Ngb-H64Q-CCC. These findings provided proof of concept that heme-based
scavenger molecules with very high CO binding affinity can be developed as potential antidotes for CO poisoning.
In the previous funding period, we continued the development of our Ngb-H64Q-CCC molecule, evaluating
efficacy on the restoration of cellular aerobic respiration, safety, and acute and long-term effects on
cardiovascular and cognitive function and survival in pre-clinical models, and scaling production of recombinant
protein for clinical development. We showed how infusion of Ngb-H64Q-CCC can restore mitochondrial
respiration in tissues and reverse CO-induced effects. We also set out to discover novel CO scavenger molecules
which may have improved properties over our lead molecule. Our studies uncovered that RcoM, a bacterial CO
sensor, has a high affinity towards CO and presents promising safety profiles in mouse models.
In the present proposal we plan to further develop our Ngb-H64Q-CCC molecule, adding modifications that
improve its CO affinity and stability for a safer toxicity profile. We also will engineer RcoM to obtain the smallest
unit that can scavenge CO with high affinity and present optimal stability and safety properties. Finally, we will
leverage all the knowledge on CO and oxygen binding achieved during our research program to develop novel
oxygen carrier molecules that can serve as blood substitutes.
Overall, these proposed studies are in keeping with the mission of the NHLBI and NIH to advance highly
impactful, significant, and novel studies that have great potential to improve the public health. Support for these
proposed studies has the potential to change our current paradigm for therapy of CO poisoning."
10894648,"ABSTRACT. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disabilities,
adversely affecting an increasing number of families worldwide. Although its etiology is strongly linked to
genetic factors, perinatal experience, including prenatal stress and post-natal social experience, may also
contribute to deficits in social communication in ASD, potentially via epigenetic mechanisms. For example, the
oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) is epigenetically altered by early social experience, plays a crucial role in
mammalian social and cognitive development, and is associated with both genetic and epigenetic risk for ASD.
However, the relationship between perinatal experience and epigenetic change in ASD is unclear. Our central
hypothesis is that prenatal stress and early social experience predicts epigenetic changes in specific genes,
which are associated with social communication deficits in ASD. To achieve our overall goal of discovering
modifiable pathways for intervention in children at risk for ASD, we will recruit over 7,200 pregnant women to
use an innovative smartphone application, BabySteps, to collect prospective data from the 3rd trimester of
pregnancy until 30 months post-delivery. Between ages 18 to 27 months, BabySteps will be used to screen for
symptoms of ASD or developmental delay (DD) in the offspring, which will trigger a full diagnostic assessment
at the Center for Disabilities and Development. Children with a range of social communication deficits
(including those diagnosed with ASD or non-ASD DD [n=200]) will be compared with typically developing
children (TD; n=200) who are matched on race, sex, and socioeconomic status. We will examine 1) differences
in DNA methylation (DNAm), and change over time, in 27 specific ASD-associated loci and 3 OXTR loci, and
2) differences in biologic age acceleration using epigenetic clock algorithms, as a function of age, perinatal
experience, and social communication outcomes. We will compare DNAm from stored newborn dried blood
spots to samples collected around the time of diagnosis. We will calculate polygenic risk scores for social
communication, repetitive behavior, and ASD, and assess the relative polygenic and epigenetic risk. The
relationship between perinatal experience, DNAm, and social communication outcomes will be evaluated using
4 complementary measures: 1) ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of prenatal stress and parental
anxiety and depression, collected using BabySteps; 2) app-recorded free play between parent and child
analyzed for dyadic synchrony and interactive behavior; 3) standardized assessments of child social
communication skills; and 4) a Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA), using a LENA audio-recording device
worn by the child at home and in daycare. We expect to identify epigenetic biomarkers that link prenatal stress
and early social experience with social communication outcomes in ASD. A better understanding of how
polygenic risk and perinatal experience—via epigenetic mechanisms—contribute to the ASD phenotype will
help overcome a critical barrier to progress in the field, by identifying modifiable pathways for intervention."

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with 19 million deaths globally
in 2020 alone. Central to management of CVDs is deepening our knowledge of physiology and pathology of the
heart. Major barriers to our greater understanding of the heart include its deep location and fast dynamics.
Evidence from invasive coronary angiography indicates that the maximum velocity of cardiac structures is 52.5
mm/s, requiring a scan time of 19.1ms to eliminate motion artifacts. To achieve this temporal resolution with
CT is extremely challenging. There have been substantial gains in CT hardware and software over the last
decades (whole heart, dual-source, dedicated cardiac CT, and various approaches to cardiac motion
compensation with ECG-gating) that have transformed coronary CT angiography into a robust and viable clinical
tool. However, owing to the 140ms temporal resolution of current whole heart CT scanners, diagnosis is still
challenging in patients who have irregular and/or fast heart rates especially in cases of arrhythmias and
tachycardia, which commonly occur in older adults, many of whom exhibit atrial fibrillation.
Here we will apply deep learning to radically improve cardiac CT reconstruction by attaining significantly higher
spatial resolution, lower radiation exposure, and better image quality on both modern and legacy CT hardware.
To improve wide-area-detector cardiac CT performance, we will develop a limited-angle reconstruction algorithm
in the Analytic, Compressive, Iterative, and Deep (ACID) reconstruction framework that integrates a deep
network trained on large data, sparsity-promotion, analytic modeling, and iterative refinement. For the first time,
two of the preeminent advances in signal processing, compressive sensing and deep learning, will be combined
to extract full information from scan data and image priors to freeze the beating heart.
The specific aims H3 are: (1) Hyper Dataset: Projection datasets in the Radon space and the corresponding
ground-truth images without motion artifacts in the image space will be generated in simulation, experiments,
and clinical studies; (2) Hybrid Algorithm: A deep learning network and CS-module will be developed, integrated,
and accelerated within the ACID framework for limited-angle free-breathing cardiac CT reconstruction, which will
be shared on an open-source platform; and (3) Holistic Evaluation: The performance of our reconstruction
software will be characterized, the stability and generalizability will be investigated, and task-based clinical
applications will be demonstrated, including quantification of stenosis severity, aorta dimensions, and motion
artifacts within the clinical setting of individuals with atrial fibrillation, tachycardia, and irregular heart rates.
Completion of this project will yield a free-breathing cardiac CT algorithm with the unprecedented temporal
resolution of 60ms, a 230% improvement over the state-of-the-art, allowing cardiac CT without clinically-relevant
motion artifacts. This represents a major step towards the integration of model-driven and data-driven methods
for CT image reconstruction, with a lasting impact on not only CT but also other tomographic modalities."
10847532,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a global epidemic affecting approximately 462 million individuals world-wide. Cur-
rent medical treatment guidelines rely largely on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that study average
effects, which is far from adequate for making individualized decisions for real world patients. This limitation is
even worse for discovering dynamic treatment regimens (DTRs) in a heterogeneous population where treatment
decisions are made over one or more stages of disease course. This limitation can be partially addressed by sup-
plementing RCT data with real world data (RWD), such as disease registries, prospective observational studies,
surveys and electronic health records, to improve medical decision making. Despite of the promise of combining
RWD and RCT, there are several signiﬁcant challenges in method and algorithm development. These include
lack of generalizability or practical utility for the ﬁndings from RCTs when applied to real world patients; bias due
to unobserved confounders; and concern about long-term side effects/risks. This proposal aims to address each
of these challenges. Speciﬁcally, in Aim 1, we address the generalizability issue by proposing a novel framework
that uses evidence from RWD to improve learning DTRs in the trials. The framework uses RWD to select infor-
mative tailoring features, balance population distributions and improve statistical efﬁciency through doubly robust
estimation. In Aim 2, to improve the practical utility of DTRs, we propose a robust method to ﬁrst infer individual
treatment choice/preference from RWD, then incorporate this estimated preference into learning DTRs using the
trial data. The resulting DTRs are not only statistically valid but also compatible with patient/clinician preference
in real world populations. In Aim 3, to lessen the bias due to hidden confounders in RWD, we propose joint
semiparametric models to combine the trial data with RWD; the models we propose allow different magnitudes
of treatment effect sizes and control for possible bias due to hidden confounders in RWD. In Aim 4, to address
the concern about long-term risks, we consider a general procedure for estimating DTRs that maximizes efﬁcacy
outcomes while ensuring that long-term side effects associated with the recommended DTRs remain below a
certain threshold. We then propose a novel simultaneous learning algorithm to estimate the optimal DTRs across
all stages. For all four aims, we will provide rigorous assumptions and theoretical justiﬁcations using tools from
concentration inequalities, statistical learning theory, empirical processes and semiparametric inference. We will
conduct extensive simulation studies to study the performance of the proposed approaches in a variety of set-
tings, and compare their performance with off-the-shelf methods. We will apply the proposed methods to estimate
DTRs for T2D using clinical trial data and RWD taken from electronic health records in Columbia University and
Ohio State University medical centers as well as Allof Us precision medicine study. Our methods and ﬁndings will
be publicized through software development; the software will receive frequent updates based on user feedback."
10890805,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to understand in mechanistic terms how proteins are transported across
membranes. One aspect of this proposal is to clarify how misfolded endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins are
retro-translocated from the ER into the cytosol (ER-associated protein degradation, ERAD). The proposal is
based on recently determined cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of the Hrd1 complex that elucidated
how luminal proteins are retro-translocated, and on experiments that clarified how the Cdc48 ATPase processes
its substrates. Another aspect of the proposal deals with protein import into peroxisomes. Our recent results
indicate that folded cargo translocates with its receptor into the lumen of peroxisomes; the receptor subsequently
returns to the cytosol through a retro-translocon formed by a heterotrimeric ubiquitin ligase complex. Here, we will
address central outstanding questions of these protein translocation pathways:
Specific aim #1: How are proteins moved from the ER lumen across the membrane?
We will clarify the mechanism by which misfolded glycoproteins are delivered to the Hrd1 complex and moved
through the membrane.
Specific aim #2: How are substrates moved from the ER membrane to the proteasome?
We propose to determine how the Cdc48 complex moves substrates into the cytosol and test the hypothesis that
membrane proteins are extracted together with bound lipids. We will investigate how shuttling factors and Cdc48-
binding cofactors transfer substrates between Cdc48 and the 26S proteasome.
Specific aim #3: How are proteins imported into peroxisomes?
Based on preliminary experiments, we propose to test the hypothesis that Pex13 forms a nuclear pore-like
structure through which cargo-bound receptors move across the peroxisomal membrane.
Specific aim #4: How are receptors recycled back into the cytosol?
We will test our model that the ubiquitin ligase complex forms a retro-translocation channel for recycling
receptors. We will use purified proteins to reconstitute ubiquitination by the ligase complex and the subsequent
membrane extraction by the Pex1/Pex6 ATPase.
 The mechanism of ERAD and of peroxisomal protein import are of great medical importance. Many diseases,
including cystic fibrosis, are caused by the misfolding of ER proteins and their degradation. The pathway is also
hijacked by certain viruses and toxins, and a better understanding may lead to new drugs allowing interference.
Our work may also lead to a better understanding and treatment of peroxisomal disorders, such as Zellweger
syndrome."
10783084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advanced hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancers, the most common subtype, are
initially responsive to multiple endocrine interventions, but they ultimately develop drug resistance.
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) underlie the blood-borne metastatic spread of cancer, and they
also provide a noninvasive source to sample tumor cells during the course of therapy and acquired
resistance. Using a microfluidic enrichment technology that preserves CTC viability, we successfully
established a cohort of 15 CTC-derived longterm cultures from women with refractory HR+ breast
cancer. A subset of these shows the expected acquired ESR1 and PIK3CA mutations, confirmed in
matched metastatic tumor biopsies. However, the most common, and least well understood, correlate of
endocrine resistance is loss of estrogen receptor-α (ER) expression by cancer cells. In these cases,
cultured CTCs recapitulate ER silencing, and some are biphenotypic, with coexisting ER+ and ER-
subpopulations derived from the same patient. Single cell-derived colonies show that ER+ CTCs can
produce ER- progeny, pointing to likely epigenetic mechanisms and underlying cell plasticity. We
propose to investigate the epigenetic regulation of ER expression loss and its potential restoration,
using genomic analyses combined with CRISPR functional screens. In Aim 1, we will compare
chromatin landscapes of isogenic ER+ and ER- CTC subpopulations, define their distinct functional
properties and identify factors that modulate their interconversion in vitro. In Aim 2, we will use undertake
CRISPR screens to identify genes capable of restoring ER expression to CTC lines from HR+ breast
cancers that have lost endogenous ER expression following endocrine therapy. Preliminary data
indicate the feasibility of this approach, and we will explore mechanisms underlying restoration of
ER expression, and whether this is accompanied by a return to ER-dependent proliferation. Together,
these Aims address the plasticity of ER expression in patient-derived cultured CTCs that
recapitulate clinical treatment exposures and tumor adaptation mechanisms. Loss of ER expression in HR
+ breast cancer may also lead to dependence on alternative oncogenic drivers, that may be constitute
drug targets in refractory HR+ breast cancer. In Aim 3, we apply a chemical proteomic strategy in CTC
lines, combining cysteine cross-linking with mass spectrometry to identify all ligandable cysteine residues
within cellular proteins. Preliminary data show multiple cysteine-targetable proteins in CTCs that are not
present in untreated breast cancer lines, and we will use CRISPR screens to identify those required for
proliferation, followed by identification of tool compounds from a specialized library of cysteine-reactive
covalent inhibitors for functional analyses. Together, these complementary approaches address the loss
of ER expression in advanced HR+ breast cancers, with the goal of overcoming acquired resistance to
endocrine therapy."
10837705,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had substantial effects on youth in multiple aspects of life, raising concern about
its impact on youth mental health. Indeed, mounting data suggest that youth depression and anxiety rates have
increased compared to the pre-pandemic era. A key challenge is to recognize prospective predictors that can
help identify youth at risk for serious mental health sequelae following COVID-19 and to disentangle the factors
that contribute to resilient trajectories. Resilience, often defined as an adaptive outcome (i.e., low symptoms
levels) following adversity, is driven by multiple systems including individual- and structural-level environmental
factors, neurocognitive traits, and genetic factors. One approach to study resilience is to identify inter-individual
variation in mental health trajectories following the pandemic, and use data collected prospectively before and
early in the pandemic to better understands what determines variability in mental health trajectories under stress.
The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (N~12,000, 52% male, recruited at age 9-10
years, 20% Black) follows diverse US youth longitudinally since 2017. The study collected multidimensional
(i.e., environment, clinical, neurocognitive, genetic) data before the pandemic, and participants were ~12-13
years old when the pandemic hit. Between May 2020 to June 2021, the study team collected data on mental
health and on COVID-19 related exposures at multiple time points from ~9,500 participants and will continue
following participants into late adolescence. Therefore, ABCD Study creates a unique opportunity to
disentangle risk and resilience factors collected prospectively in youth who were in early-mid adolescence
when the pandemic hit, a critical developmental window when stress related disorders become more prevalent.
In the current project, we propose to leverage the multi-dimensional ABCD Study data to identify factors that
contribute to variability in mental health trajectories in US youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will first use
latent growth mixture modeling to identify trajectories of internalizing symptoms over time. Thereafter, we will
characterize the individual stressors and the structural (based on geocoded address) environmental exposures-
before and early in the pandemic- that contribute to trajectories of risk and resilience (Aim 1). In addition, we will
leverage the deep phenotyping that was conducted pre-COVID-19 to identify clinical and neurocognitive risk and
resilience factors (Aim 2). Lastly, we will explore whether participants' genetic information (i.e., polygenic risk for
psychiatric disorders) can help explain variability in mental health trajectories during the pandemic (Aim 3). The
proposed research will identify what factors contribute to resilience (i.e., resilience factors); and who will show
risk or resilience trajectory in response to chronic (pandemic-imposed) stress. The study addresses key gaps
that are critical considering the expected chronic stress that is (and will likely keep being) imposed on youth due
to the pandemic and other future adversities. Findings will improve risk stratification in youth exposed to chronic
adversity and will identify targets for interventions aimed at enhancing resilience."
10886058,"Breast cancer ranks second among cancer deaths in women in the United States. Breast cancer-related
mortality primarily results from metastatic growth of disseminated cells. While dissemination of cancer cells
occurs early during tumor progression, metastatic outgrowth of extravasated cancer cells often takes many
years due to the dormant behavior of cancer cells. In principle, the survival of breast cancer patients should be
improved if metastatic burden is reduced by either prolonging the dormancy of disseminated tumor cells or
slowing down progressive metastatic growth. Our overarching goal is to identify tumor cell-intrinsic
transcriptional programs that are critical for dormancy-to-emergence transition and progressive growth of
established metastases in breast cancer. In the proposed study, we hypothesize that dormancy-to-
emergence switch and progressive metastatic growth of breast cancer cells require the action of Myocardin-
related transcription factor (MRTF), a transcriptional coactivator of serum-response factor (SRF). To test this
hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct genetic and pharmacological proof-of-
concept studies to establish the role of MRTF/SRF transcriptional axis in regulation of dormancy and
metastatic growth of breast cancer cells. Aim 2 will test whether MRTF/SRF activity promotes metastatic
growth of breast cancer cells through both tumor-intrinsic and –extrinsic mechanisms. The proposed studies
will employ a highly comprehensive experimental strategy integrating inducible functional disruption and
pharmacological intervention strategies, intravital imaging of tumor cell activity at metastatic sites,
organotypic models of lung and liver tumor microenvironment to study tumor dormancy, mouse model
studies, use of patient-derived organoids and clinical samples of BC, and multiplexed quantitative IHC. A
successful completion of these studies will establish MRTF as a novel regulator of dormancy-emergence
behavior of breast cancer cells with mechanistic details, and provide proof-of-concepts for pharmacological
intervention of MRTF as a novel strategy to induce dormancy and curb metastatic growth in breast cancer."
10828431,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Hemiparesis of the upper-limb is one of the most serious impairments resulting from stroke. Paresis of finger
and thumb extensors is a frequently persisting consequence of stroke, and causes loss of hand function. We
have developed contralaterally controlled functional electrical stimulation (CCFES), a novel neuromuscular
electrical stimulation (NMES) therapy that gives the patient intimate control of both timing and intensity of
stimulation to their finger and thumb extensors and thereby enables intention-driven hand opening and enhanced
functional task practice. Several clinical trials of CCFES-assisted therapy have shown that it reduces impairment
and improves function of the affected upper-limb, and it improves dexterity more than conventional NMES. The
main objective of this study is to build upon the benefits of CCFES-assisted therapy for chronic stroke motor
recovery. One strategy to improve rehabilitation outcomes is to combine treatments that may have synergistic
effects. Therefore, this study applies transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to the motor cortex during
CCFES to determine if the combination of the two will improve outcomes over those achieved by CCFES alone.
TDCS and CCFES may work in synergy to improve outcomes by increasing the concurrent activity of the cortical
neurons within the ipsilesional motor network (conventional tDCS montage) or by exciting the contralesional
networks (unconventional tDCS montage), as suggested by our pilot single-session cross-over study. The
specific aims of the study are: 1) Determine if the addition of tDCS during CCFES improves motor outcomes
over CCFES alone, 2) Estimate the relative effects of two tDCS electrode arrangements on motor outcomes,
and 3) Estimate the relative effects of two tDCS electrode arrangements on neurophysiologic outcomes. We will
conduct a randomized controlled trial in which 63 stroke survivors 6 to 24 months post-stroke will be randomly
assigned to 12 weeks of: a) conventional tDCS during CCFES, b) unconventional tDCS during CCFES, or c)
sham tDCS during CCFES.
Upper extremity impairment, activity limitation and neurophysiologic assessment will
be made at baseline, 6, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. This study is the first RCT of tDCS during CCFES in chronic
upper extremity hemiplegia. The information learned in this study will serve to accelerate the development of
treatments for reducing post-stroke disability."

The immaturity of pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (PSC-CMs) has emerged as a major challenge
for their broad applicability. For this reason, extensive biological and engineering efforts are underway with the
goal to generate mature, adult-like CMs from PSCs. However, owing to the lack of quantitative metrics to
benchmark the maturation status of PSC-CMs, the efforts are being made largely on an ad hoc basis, and this
leaves the degree and direction of PSC-CM maturation unclear. To address this, we have developed a
quantitative metric based on an entropy concept that enables cross-comparison studies robust to experimental
variability and species difference. With this finding, this proposal aims to apply entropy score to determine the
status and trajectory of PSC-CM maturation achieved by molecular stimulation, tissue engineering, and in vivo
transplantation, combined with functional and structural analysis. The use of entropy score is expected to reveal
strengths and weaknesses of the ongoing approaches and inform us potential causes of maturation arrest and
deviations. Thus, the proposed research will provide mechanistic insights into instructing PSC-CM to become
adult CMs as well as quantitative insights into the progress made towards PSC-CM maturation in the field."
10827982,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common pediatric soft tissue sarcoma in the United States. Fusion-
negative (FN) RMS are the most common subtype and are driven by RAS-pathway activation. Despite intensive
treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery, a large fraction of patients develop refractory, metastatic,
and relapsed RMS that has survival rates of less than 20%. A major hurdle to the design of new and effective
treatments for aggressive RMS can be attributed to our limited understanding of the drivers of cancer stem cell
(CSC) self-renewal and metastasis. The long-term goal and overall objective of our studies is to identify CSCs
and metastatic cells in FN-RMS and then define molecular pathways that can differentiate these cells into non-
proliferative, non-migratory cell types or kill them completely. Our central hypothesis is that FN-RMS CSCs drive
tumor growth, therapy-resistance and metastasis. We also hypothesize that the genes and pathways promoting
the transition of RMS cells into differentiated non-proliferative, non-metastatic cell types can be therapeutically
targeted. The rationale and feasibility of our approach comes from our recent discovery of a novel, molecularly-
defined FN-RMS CSC that expresses mesenchymal pathway-enriched genes and shares remarkable similarity
to a recently discovered bi-potent, muscle mesenchyme progenitor that can make both muscle and osteogenic
cells between 9-14 weeks of human development. This FN-RMS CSC is molecularly-distinct from CSCs reported
by others in the field, can be isolated using CD44/CD90 antibodies and FACs, and expresses genes associated
with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a major driver of metastasis in other cancers. Aim 1
will identify FN-RMS cell heterogeneity and cell types that drive tumor growth and metastasis using single cell
sequencing, lineage and cell fate barcode tracing, and mouse xenograft studies. This work will test the
hypothesis that CD44+/CD90+ FN-RMS cells define the CSCs and that these cells are largely quiescent under
steady state growth conditions, and yet undergo self-renewal divisions following chemo- and radiation-therapy
to drive tumor regrowth and metastasis. Aim 2 will quantify human FN-RMS CSC self-renewal and cell state
transitions in vivo at single cell resolution using fluorescent cell state reporters, photoconvertible cell lineage
tracing tools, and engraftment into optically-clear immune deficient zebrafish. This aim will test the hypothesis
that CSCs undergo asymmetric/symmetric self-renewal divisions following therapy to re-create all the functionally
diverse cell types in RMS. Aim 3 will identify the molecular mechanisms driving FN-RMS cell states, testing the
hypothesis that DNA binding proteins and transcription factors, including NOTCH3 and MEF2C, are dominant
oncogenic drivers of RMS cell fate and independently regulate gene networks that promote CSC and/or
differentiated muscle cell states. This work will have a positive translational impact by defining new pathways to
kill and/or differentiate FN-RMS CSCs and identifying potential biomarkers of therapy resistance based on
retention of CSCs after therapy."

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are induced by environmental and chemotherapeutic agents, and during
encounters of the DNA replication machinery with DNA damage. The two major, mechanistically distinct DSB
repair pathways are non-homologous DNA end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). NHEJ is
efficient but error-prone, while HDR is inherently accurate and represents the preferred repair tool for DNA
replication-associated DSBs. HDR commences with the resection of the 5’-terminated strand at break ends
to generate a DNA tail that serves as the template for assembly of the RAD51 recombinase filament. DSB
repair pathway choice is linked to cell cycle progression and is determined by whether or not a DSB undergoes
extensive resection. Long-range resection is principally mediated by the 5’-3’ exonuclease EXO1 or the BLM
helicase-DNA2 endonuclease. The chromatin reader 53BP1 nucleates the formation of a higher order
ensemble that harbors the RIF1 protein and the hetero-tetrameric Shieldin complex at DSB ends to block end
resection in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The restrictive action of the 53BP1 axis is alleviated by BRCA1-
BARD1 in S and G2 phases via mechanisms that are poorly understood. Thus, BRCA1-deficient tumors, on
account of their HDR-deficiency, are particularly vulnerable to PARP inhibitors (PARPi) due to synthetic
lethality. However, dysfunction in the 53BP1 axis leads to HDR restoration and PARPi resistance. Importantly,
we now have compelling evidence that RIF1 and Shieldin strongly restrict the activity of the DNA end resection
enzymes. To elucidate the underpinnings of the DNA end resection restriction circuitry, we will employ a
combinatorial approach encompassing reconstitution biochemistry and cell biology to: (1) Delineate how RIF1
and Shieldin interfere with the activity of the 5’-3’ exonuclease EXO1 and of the helicase-endonuclease
complex BLM-DNA2 in DNA end resection and (2) Interrogate BRCA1-BARD1 for its ability to overcome the
restriction of DNA end resection imposed by RIF1 and Shieldin. Our studies will elucidate the intricate
regulatory networks that control DNA end resection onset and efficiency. Our endeavors will not only illuminate
the mechanistic principles of DSB repair pathway choice, but will also exert a major impact in our
understanding of how failure to properly process DSBs lead to neoplastic cell transformation and cancer, and
will provide actionable information to help guide the development of targeted cancer therapies to treat BRCA-
deficient cancers and circumvent drug resistance."

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are induced by environmental and chemotherapeutic agents, and during
encounters of the DNA replication machinery with DNA damage. The two major, mechanistically distinct DSB

efficient but error-prone, while HDR is inherently accurate and represents the preferred repair tool for DNA

Antiretroviral treatment is unable to clear HIV-1 infection because a highly stable latent viral reservoir
persists in the host. Key areas of interest with respect to HIV-1 eradication strategies include latent
reservoir establishment, size and make-up. A considerable amount is now known about these key areas in
subtype B-infected American men, yet there remains limited knowledge in the most affected population,
subtype C-infected South African women, or in African populations in general. Population differences may
exist with respect to reservoir characteristics, and eradication strategies would need to take such
differences into account. Characterization of the HIV-1 reservoir in the African context therefore represents
a much needed area of attention.
This project proposes to firstly address the need for implementation of a high-throughput, accurate reservoir
sizing method in South Africa through optimization of the newly developed intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA)
for subtype C HIV-1. This method will be applied to more than 200 women from KwaZulu Natal. Reservoir
size in these women will be compared to that of individuals from Ugandan and American cohorts using the
same assay to evaulate reservoir differences across populations. This project will also investigate a role for
the viral factors Nef and the long terminal repeat, which are drivers of immune evasion and gene
transcription respectively, in reservoir size and make-up in a subset of these women. Finally, we will explore
the contribution of viral variants from the blood and cervix to the long-lived reservoir in these women using
Bayesian evolutionary analyses.
We hypothesize that Nef-mediated MHC-I downregulation and LTR activity have independent effects on
reservoir size and distribution, and these effects differ according to infecting subtype and study population.
This project will allow for comparison of reservoir size across populations using a standardized assay and
will evaluate determinants of size and kinetics of establishment."
10874595,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 1 
Historically, TB has been characterized as a two-stage process – infection and disease. It now is clear that 
infection and importantly the likelihood once infected of progressing to TB is heterogeneous and varies with 
time. We propose now to address in human studies how bacterial and host heterogeneity modify the 
distribution of stages of TB infection following close contact with a TB case, the risk of progression and the 
manifestations and sequelae of TB disease. On the bacterial side, Mtb strains from index cases could be 
dichotomized into high transmission (Mtb-HT) and low transmission (Mtb-LT) based on the proportion of 
exposed household contacts that were TST+. Mtb-HT was associated with greater risk of progression to 
disease and more cavitation on chest X-ray. As regards host heterogeneity, we posit that risk of signature 
signatures are a proxy for intrinsic differences in the host immune response to Mtb. In South Africa the ACS- 
COR signature was a good correlate of PET-CT scan findings of subclinical TB. As regards short-and long- 
term risk of progression, in Brazil, we characterized a transcriptional signature PREDICT29 tied to the immune 
response that predicted progression to TB. We will use the household contact model in a prospective cohort in 
Uganda and retrospective cohorts in Uganda and Brazil to partition the risk of infection with Mtb-HT between 
immunopathology of the index case (eg cavitation and subsequent lung damage), greater force of infection for 
HHC, the modifying effects of PREDICT29 and co-morbidities, and increased risk of progression along the 
spectrum from LTBI to TB. Specific Aims are to determine the impact of Mtb strain phenotype (eg Mtb-HT v 
Mtb-LT) and host heterogeneity (risk of progression signatures, co-morbidities) on: 1. The distribution of stages 
of Mtb infection and disease in exposed HHC: the proportion of MTBI that express PREDICT29, a risk of 
progression signature; ACS-COR, an inflammatory signature; subclinical TB and active TB; 2. The risk and 
timing of progression from MTBI to TB and 3. The extent and nature (eg cavitation) of pulmonary disease in 
TB index cases; the duration of inflammation; and the consequent impairment in pulmonary function. 
These studies could permit individualized approaches to diagnosis, targeting of preventive therapy, and 
treatment of active TB. They synergize with Project 2 and the clinical core in providing PBMC and BAL from 
well-characterized populations that will allow determination of the immunologic basis for the findings in this 
Project 1; and with Projects 3 in providing clinical Mtb isolates known to differ in transmission and pathogenesis 
for study of tolerance."
10874600,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 2 Between the initial encounter of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) with
alveolar macrophages (AM) and the development of active disease lies a continuum in which asymptomatic
infection may progress to tuberculosis (TB) disease over an extended timeframe. The host response that
must evolve as the infection progresses toward disease has not been defined. Equally unclear is the role of
Mtb-intrinsic factors in modulating the host response and consequently, the kinetics of the progression of
infection to disease. We have characterized a biomarker signature (PREDICT29) that can predict the
risks for progression from infection. Clinical epidemiological study identified 2 classes of Mtb based
on the capacity of the bacilli from index cases to be transmitted to cause infection in household contacts
(HHC): Mtb-HT (high transmission) and Mtb-LT (low transmission). Chest x-ray of Mtb-HT IC displayed
increased frequency of cavitary disease. Analysis of Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT in C3HeB/FeJ mice revealed
remarkable differences among the 2 strains in i) the responses elicited in AM; ii) the immunopathological
patterns, with lung necrotic lesions only apparent in Mtb-HT infected mice; iii) the T cell response during
the chronic phase of infection; and iv) the expression of phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), an Mtb cell
envelope lipid. These characteristics of Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT may thus link Mtb-intrinsic factors to differential
regulation of the early innate immune response (the Mtb-AM interaction) that leads to the development of
distinct adaptive immunity that in turn, governs the kinetics and frequency with which asymptomatic
infection progresses to disease. PREDICT29 (segregates progressors vs nonprogressors), in
conjunction with the ACS-COR signature (identifies individuals at a later phase of infection),
enables the placement of subjects in our cohorts infected with Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT at the early phase
of infection that are progressors or nonprogressors or late phase of infection. A combination of ex vivo
cellular systems, singe-cell RNA-seq analysis, hi-dimensional mass cytometry, and Nanostring technology
will be employed to characterize the immune response exhibited by these various subgroups. We propose
to test the following hypothesis: i) Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT elicit differential AM response; ii) Disparate T cell and
antibody response in HHC infected with Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT differentially regulate the
immunopathology and progression to disease; iii) memory T cells play a role in regulating infection
progression. Immunological analysis of these subgroups comprising Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT infected
subjects in specific phase of infection, with a focus on the early Mtb-AM interaction, adaptive T cell and
antibody response, will provide a large body of information that will shed light on the mechanisms that
regulate infection and disease outcomes in the context of progressors and nonprogressors and Mtb-
intrinsic factors."
10874608,"Abstract Project 3: Minimizing in vivo drug tolerance induction in tuberculosis.
Phenotypic drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an expression of one of the single most significant
properties that make Mtb such a major Global Health threat. Tolerance promotes bacterial persistence in the
face of drug therapy and expands the window for emergence of genetically-encoded resistance. The goal of the
project is the rational design of a novel therapeutic approach to minimize the induction of drug tolerance through
manipulation of the host cells or the immune environment that result in drug tolerance. Such an outcome would
enhance the efficacy of current TB drug regimens and reduce emergence of heritable drug resistance.
 To accomplish this goal, we will leverage a number of recent advances from our labs. The Russell lab has
developed the capability to simultaneously profile host and pathogen transcriptomes in cells isolated directly
from drug-treated animals. The Sassetti lab has developed a complementary genetic database that
comprehensively quantifies the effect of bacterial mutations on drug tolerance during infection, and has exploited
CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer the genomes of primary macrophage lines.
 The overarching hypothesis guiding this project is that phenotypic drug tolerance in Mtb is induced by
the host immune environment, which can be specifically modulated to increase drug efficacy.
Aim 1: Identify macrophage immune or metabolic pathways that influence Mtb drug tolerance.
We will apply different RNA-seq modalities to infected macrophages from the lungs of antibiotic-treated mice to
identify host pathways that are linked with the expression of tolerance-related bacterial genes. Integrating diverse
Mtb isolates will link these mechanistic observations to clinically-relevant phenotypes.
Aim 2: Characterize mechanistic links between macrophage metabolic state and Mtb drug tolerance.
We will exploit emergent genetic tools to probe bacterial and host macrophage biology for the functional
verification of candidate pathways leading to induction of drug tolerance in Mtb. We will use a combination of
culture and host cell model systems to link specific immune pathways to induction of bacterial drug tolerance.
Aim 3: Proof-of-Concept for therapeutic interventions to maintain/enhance frontline drug efficacy.
We will use synthetic mRNA and siRNA approaches to explore avenues whereby in vivo drug tolerance can be
minimized and the efficacy of frontline drugs can be effectively sustained. A combination of reductionist animal
models and human clinical specimens will be used to link mechanism with therapeutic relevance."
10874613,"ABSTRACT - PROJECT 4
 Perhaps the greatest barrier to improving tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes is the six months of multi-
drug therapy that is required to reliably cure a patient with active disease. Lengthy therapy is both costly and
leads to poor adherence. This project aims to understand the bacterial factors responsible for lengthy TB
treatment, TB treatment failure, and relapse. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB has
developed an exquisite ability to adapt to its environment. Drug treatment can lead to the development of
“phenotypically drug-resistant” (i.e. drug tolerant) subpopulations that persist for long periods, as well as atypical
very-low level drug resistant mutants (i.e. elevated sub-breakpoint MIC strains) that can eventually relapse
despite months of seemingly effective drug treatment. Our overriding hypothesis is that the length of time
required to treat TB and the adverse TB outcomes that can occur even with adequate therapy are strongly linked
to phenotypic drug resistance and low-level genetic drug resistance mechanisms that can be present in Mtb
subpopulation pre-treatment, or that arise during treatment. This project will apply novel tools we have
developed, including One-cell Doubling Evaluation of Living Arrays of Mycobacterium (ODELAM), a robotic
Transwell Tolerance and Resistance (TTR) system, a complete library of transcription factor inducible (TFI)
strains, and constitutively tolerant glpK mutant Mtb strains to investigate the mechanisms that underlie these
bacterial states, as well as the heterogeneous expression of tolerance and low level resistance in different Mtb
sub-populations. Expanding from well-defined laboratory strains to a diverse collection of well characterized
clinical Mtb strains associated with either cure or relapse, we will develop a mechanistic understanding of these
still poorly characterized bacterial phenotypes and their role in treatment outcome. These discoveries will lead
to important opportunities for developing targeted TB treatments that increase therapeutic success while
shortening treatment times. This work will be conducted in three related aims: Aim 1. Define the links between
heterogeneity and phenotypic drug tolerance in Mtb. Aim 2. Determine the role of Mtb phase variation on
population heterogeneity, drug tolerance and emergent drug resistance. Aim 3. Assess role(s) of genes,
networks, and population heterogeneity in clinical isolates with defined treatment-related phenotypes."

He is a Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he has helped to establish a major center for translational malaria research. He has had continuous independent NIH funding since 2010. Dr. Juliano is committed to an academic career in patient-oriented research (POR), in which he and his trainees address problems with direct relevance to malaria control, He is recognized as an outstanding mentor, having received the prestigious 2016 Distinguished Teaching Award for Post-Baccalaureate Instruction at UNG for his strong record of mentoring trainees, which focuses on Infectious Disease fellows and MD/PhD students students involved in POR The proposed renewal of his K24 award will allow Dr. Juliano to develop new research skills to enhance his research expertise and mentorship by gaining skills in spatial and transmission modeling of malaria, by learning strategies for effective leadership, and by building on the mentoring skills developed in his K24. In particular, he will newly focus on skills specifically for mentoring diverse groups of trainees through both formal and informal guidance. To foster the career development of his trainees, Dr. Juliano will leverage the extensive training resources available at UNG, including the NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, the Gillings School of Global Public Health, and the School of Medicine. Dr. Juliana's involvement in these programs, as well as the School of Medicine MD/PhD program and the UNG Infectious Diseases Fellowship program, ensures that he will be well positioned to recruit and mentor trainees. The proposed CAMMM study (Comparative Analysis of Methods for Malaria Movement) will aid the malaria elimination agenda by providing a better understanding of how parasites move in space in different transmission settings, Understanding the spatial dynamics of parasite migration and transmission can help define hot spots for intervention, define importation, and inform models to predict the spread of resistance. However, to realize this goal, a better understanding of what genomic methods work in different locations and transmission intensities is needed. Combining advances in genotyping with training in spatial and transmission modeling though didactic and a mentored experience at Imperial College London will provide Dr. Juliano and his mentees the ability to strengthen their research and translate their genomic findings into actionable information. The proposed K24 will permit Dr. Juliano to develop a research platform that is a natural extension of his previous work, will result in a significant methodological advance for the study of malaria transmission, will enhance his mentoring skills to ensure an equitable environment for all trainees, and will establish new research opportunities to foster the career development and mentoring of trainees and young faculty members in POR."

The future of dermatologic research is threatened by the decreasing numbers of MD and MD-PhD
Dermatology residents that pursue careers in research and the lack of formal training of PhD basic science
skin researchers in translational research. In this application, we propose the Future Academic Scientists in
Dermatology (FASID) training program at Johns Hopkins to provide 3 slots for MD and MD-PhD Dermatology
residents and PhD post-doctoral fellows to be trained in basic and clinical translational research in investigative
dermatology. Each FASID trainee will have the opportunity to be mentored by one of our multidisciplinary R01-
or equivalently-funded 13 Primary Faculty Mentors based within or outside of the Dermatology Department.
Additional mentorship of the trainees will be provided by a Secondary Faculty Mentor within Dermatology and a
3-person mentorship panel to help ensure progress and a career path towards scientific independence. This
FASID program will leverage many outstanding resources at Johns Hopkins, including the Cutaneous
Translational Research Program (CTReP) (the Dermatology Department’s clinical trials unit with specific
cohorts of patients), the Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR) (the NIH-funded Clinical and
Translational Science Research Award [CTSA]), specific training in clinical research through the School of
Public Health (Science of Clinical Investigation (SOCI) and ICTR (Introduction to Clinical Research Course) as
well as multiple other institutes, centers and state-of-the-art core facilities. Since the training for Dermatology
Residents will extend their residency training from 3 to 4 years, our Department has committed additional
salary support in the 4th year to that of a clinical instructor so that there are no financial deterrents to pursuing a
career in dermatology research. FASID Trainees will undergo formal core and elective coursework and an
enrichment program, which include didactics in clinical research, the responsible conduct of research, grant
writing and many aspects of performing clinical and translational research in dermatology. Finally, there will be
many opportunities for both the trainees and mentors to evaluate and provide feedback on the progress of the
research projects, educational curriculum and the overall training program to permit real-time improvements of
the program. Successful implementation of the FASID training program is expected to produce investigators
that will become part of the next generation of Dermatology researchers that will be ethnically diverse, and who
will enter the workforce with the training in translational research to effectively move basic discoveries to new
therapies to help patients suffering from skin diseases."
10898604,"Project Summary/Abstract
Autosomal dominant Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is among the most prevalent muscular
dystrophies, affecting 1 in 7,500 to 1 in 20,000 individuals. FSHD was formally classified as a major form of
muscular dystrophy in 1954, but the pathogenic events leading to the disease have only recently started coming
into focus. Today, it is now recognized that FSHD pathogenesis involves aberrant expression of the DUX4 gene,
which encodes a myotoxic transcription factor. The emergence of DUX4 as a primary insult underlying FSHD
represented a momentum shift in the field as it provided an important target for model development and therapy
design. Indeed, as FSHD is currently untreatable, developing effective FSHD therapies is a critical need in the
field. We hypothesized that an FSHD treatment should center on inhibiting toxic DUX4 expression in skeletal
muscles. The objective of this proposal is to develop effective prospective FSHD therapies aimed at reducing or
eliminating toxic DUX4 expression. To do this, we will use new cutting edge RNA silencing and RNA editing
approaches for which technology emerged only within the last 2-3 years. These approaches only cut RNA and
not DNA, and therefore pose no risk of permanent genome modification in host cells. Because these strategies
are only newly emerged, they have never been tested in vivo using gene therapy approaches in an animal model
of disease. We will do that here, and thus our proposal will provide first proof-of-principle for in vivo efficacy use
of CRISPR-Cas13 and RNA editing technology. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will develop a new CRISPR/Cas13
gene therapy approach to cleave DUX4 mRNA before it can be made into protein. In Aim 2, we will develop RNA
editing strategies that are designed to change the DUX4 transcript and render it incapable of producing toxic full-
length forms of DUX4 protein. Finally, since these strategies are new and abundant off-target data are currently
lacking, in Aim 3, we will assess the precision of RNA cleavage and editing approaches in human FSHD and
control muscle cells. Upon completion of these Aims, we expect to produce pre-clinical data supporting the
translation of new AAV-based RNA-targeted therapies for FSHD that can be ultimately used for translation
toward our goal of clinical application. These data may also support the broader use of this technology for other
genetic disorders."

Cancer is among the leading causes of death in the United States. Lack of access to advances in cancer prevention, early
screening, and treatment, particularly in low socioeconomic, underserved communities, are cited as substantial barriers to
improving cancer survivorship. Public health experts have indicated that the social environment in which people live, learn,
work, and play also contributes to notable cancer health inequities and is among the most important determinants of health
throughout life. Overcoming the growing complexity of this problem will require a much larger, diverse, and dedicated
workforce. The current pipeline of cancer-focused health care professionals and researchers that understand and manage the
impact of these determinants of health and appropriately engage and connect with their target communities and patient
populations is dangerously inadequate and likely to widen the gap even further. To address this critical need to expand our
future culturally competent, cancer-focused workforce, the University of Cincinnati (UC) and its affiliates collectively seek
to establish and support a Cancer Research Scholars Program (CRSP). Our focus will be on creating unique and inspiring
research and educational experiences to qualified undergraduate students of all races and backgrounds from across the nation
and to implement a program that greatly increases the number of graduate program matriculants. Important to our success
will be CRSP's highly-engaged Cancer Mentor Network (CMN). We are adopting a systems-over-silos approach (i.e., an
approach that crosses health care professions and covers the entire spectrum of cancer care built around the CMN including
faculty from across the UC Cancer Center and residing at both UC and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Our
faculty are focused on topics across the cancer continuum including cancer etiology, prevention/screening/health promotion,
clinical cancer research and survivorship. To ensure our Scholars' success, we will: (1) proactively recruit 20-22 outstanding
summer scholars, including at least 8 underrepresented minorities, with an interest in cancer research with the established
infrastructure of our highly successful Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program; (2) provide training
in the essentials of research (e.g., responsible conduct of research, research design, analysis, etc.), the fundamentals of
cancer research across the continuum and an understanding of social determinants of health and their impact on cancer
inequities; (3) offer research experiences in top-notch cancer laboratories that closely match the Scholars' career interests;
(4) actively engage them in a supportive and enthusiastic environment in which they interact professionally and socially
with other Scholars, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and junior and senior faculty; (5) provide innovative education
that strengthens academic and professional development to facilitate entry into cancer graduate programs and cancer career
pathways; (6) deliver team science, cultural competency, micro-aggression and implicit bias training for the entire
CRSP/CMN community; (7) offer community-engaged, immersive, and cancer-focused field experiences to our Scholars
and CMN to encourage future community-engaged research, education and outreach; and (8) ensure long-term investment
in each Scholar that extends beyond the initial proposed summer funding period. We expect that our program will, if
successful, have a payoff of decades of enthusiastic and dedicated cancer researchers for generations to come."

The proposed K23 Career Development Award will enable Dr. Colin Orr to become an independent physician-
researcher with expertise in food insecurity and childhood obesity prevention. Dr. Orr is a general pediatrician
whose long-term goal is to design, test, and implement interventions to address food insecurity and promote
optimal nutrition and healthy weight gain in children. His strong methodologic background, combined with his
experience and knowledge of health disparities among racial and ethnic minority groups, makes him an ideal
candidate to conduct the proposed research. Dr. Orr’s preliminary work has described the cross-sectional impact
of food insecurity on parent feeding behaviors and child health outcomes. Dr. Orr’s research will contribute to
the science of obesity prevention by examining the longitudinal relationships, if any, between food insecurity,
parental feeding behaviors, and childhood obesity. Specifically, his proposed research has the following aims:
1) To examine the association between change in food insecurity and change in parental feeding behaviors in a
cohort; 2) To assess parents’ knowledge, attitudes and understanding of feeding behavior and food insecurity,
and how these relate to childhood obesity; and, 3) To develop the NCCARE360+Peer Parent Coach (PPC)
intervention and conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) that evaluates the intervention’s feasibility and
acceptability. The pilot study will serve as preliminary data for a subsequent R01. To conduct this research, Dr.
Orr has assembled a team of mentors and collaborators who will guide him in accomplishing the following training
goals: 1) Learn casual inference, longitudinal analysis, and qualitative methods to examine how food insecurity
influences child health over time and acquire the skills to design and execute qualitative studies to guide
intervention development; 2) Learn behavior change theories to inform development of a peer support
intervention; and 3) Gain training in implementation science to guide implementation of interventions. Dr. Orr’s
mentorship team will meet with him regularly, provide additional content expertise in writing manuscripts and
R01 and equivalent grants, and will ensure his progress toward his research aims and training goals. Dr. Orr’s
career development will be supported by coursework at the Gillings School of Global Public Health at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Orr’s work aligns with the National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases Strategic Plan to support research that aims to prevent chronic diseases, such
as obesity and diabetes, in racially and ethnically diverse patient populations. His proposed research has high
potential for public health impact, given the high prevalence of food insecurity and childhood obesity and the
urgent need for well-designed interventions to address these problems in racial and ethnic minority populations.
The proposed K23 award will enable Dr. Orr to take important next steps in his career development and position
him as an independent investigator with expertise in testing, implementing, and evaluating innovative solutions

10897020,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
CANDIDATE: Matthew C. Babcock, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor at the University of Colorado Anschutz
Medical Campus (CU-AMC). Dr. Babcock aims to study the neural and renal contributions to hypertension with
androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). He has developed preliminary data indicating that 1) men with lower
testosterone concentrations have reduced baroreflex sensitivity compared to men with higher testosterone
concentrations; and 2) baroreflex sensitivity in these individuals is correlated with circulating concentrations of
the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. In this proposal, he will translate these data by comprehensively
assessing neural control of blood pressure in men who undergo ADT, and extend his observations to include
renal control of blood pressure. The central hypothesis is that ADT increases inflammation and thereby reduces
baroreflex sensitivity, increases sympathetic reactivity, and increases renovascular resistance. CAREER
DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Babcock proposes to enhance his career development by: 1) acquiring new skills
in the assessment of renal plasma flow, assessment of renal function biomarkers, and assessment of pro-
inflammatory cytokines; 2) Advanced training renal diseases and physiology; 3) Working with a clinical population
by recruiting men diagnosed with prostate cancer and studying them while they undergo ADT under the guidance
of Dr. Elizabeth Kessler, a medical oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer; and 4) Refining his professional
skills through formal course work, attendance and presentations at weekly Scientific Advancement and Grand
Rounds, and at national scientific meetings. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Babcock will train in an outstanding research
environment supported by a multi-disciplinary team of mentors. The primary mentor, Dr. Moreau, is an NIA-
funded professor at CU-AMC with a record of successful mentorship. She is an expert in the role of sex hormones
and inflammation on cardiovascular function. She has extensive experience in utilizing the gonadal suppression
study design proposed in the current study. Co-Mentor Dr. William Cornwell, III is also at CU-AMC and an expert
in autonomic control of the circulation. Co-Mentor Dr. Jessica Kendrick and advisor Dr. Petter Bjornstad are also
at CU-AMC and experts in studying renal function. Advisor Dr. Kessler is an expert in prostate cancer and ADT.
Advisor Drs. Joyner and Farquhar are experts in autonomic function and the exercise pressor reflex.
RESEARCH: ADT is a mainstay in the management of prostate cancer and the impressive survival rates among
with men diagnosed with prostate cancer is largely attributed to the effectiveness of ADT. However, ADT
increases the likelihood of developing hypertension and, accordingly, prostate cancer survivors who were treated
with ADT are more likely to die early from cardiovascular diseases compared to men treated without the use of
ADT. There is a critical need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the increased cardiovascular disease risk
in these patients to improve the lives of prostate cancer survivors."
10854777,"Anticipated Impacts on Veteran’s Healthcare: Insomnia is a critical obstacle to the rehabilitation and
functional recovery of Veterans with psychotic disorders. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has made
treatment of insomnia a high priority; and has initiated a nationwide dissemination of Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)–an evidence-based psychotherapy and the first-line standard of care for
insomnia–across the VHA system. However, there are many challenges to treating insomnia in people with
psychosis; and as a result, they are rarely treated with CBT-I. As part of my CDA-2, I developed guidelines to
tailor CBT-I to address each of these challenges. I have piloted CBT-I delivered with these guidelines and
have found that it is feasible, acceptable, and shows preliminary efficacy. A larger, fully powered trial is
needed to evaluate efficacy of CBT-I delivered with these guidelines on insomnia and functioning of Veterans
with psychosis. If CBT-I tailored for psychosis is effective, these guidelines will be incorporated into the
national VA CBT-I manual and training materials. Thereby, immediately translating research into clinical
practice for maximal functional impact. This project will allow us to evaluate insomnia as a target for accelerating
rehabilitation and provide clarity as to whether this population—one of the most severely impaired and costly groups
of Veterans—can experience long-term functional benefits from bettersleep.
Project Background: Insomnia affects an alarming number of Veterans with psychotic disorders; causes
significant long-term negative impacts on physical, emotional, psychosocial, and cognitive recovery;
aggravates psychotic symptoms; and confers a nearly 15-fold increase in lifetime risk for attempting suicide.
Among people with other chronic medical and mental health conditions, randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
demonstrate that successful insomnia treatment can lead to significantly: improved sleep, cognitive, social,
and daily functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and health-related quality of life. However, Veterans with
psychosis are rarely offered CBT-I, the current gold standard treatment for insomnia, due to a lack of
empirically driven clinical guidelines that can assist providers in its delivery with this complex population.
Veterans with psychosis deserve access to the same treatments that are available to other Veterans; this
inequity in delivery of insomnia treatment must be addressed.
Project Objectives: The proposed research will evaluate the efficacy of CBT-I delivered with guidelines for
psychosis on improving sleep and associated functional outcomes in Veterans with psychosis and insomnia via
a large-scale multi-site randomized control trial (RCT) comparing 10 weeks of CBT-I (n=78) to 10 weeks of an
active control intervention (n=78) on insomnia symptoms and functioning. In addition, we will assess the
durability of effects of CBT-I on insomnia symptoms and functioning at a 6-month follow-up visit. We expect
that Veterans in CBT-I will evidence a greater reduction in insomnia symptoms and improvement in functioning
at immediate post-treatment and at 6 months post-treatment. Finally, to understand the ways that Veterans
with psychosis are impacted by resolution of chronic insomnia; we will also examine how improvements in
insomnia severity mediate functional change at both post-treatment and 6-month follow-upassessments.
Project Methods: This project includes completing an RCT with 156 participants at the VA Maryland Health
Care System and Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VA Medical Center in Philadelphia. Primary outcome measures
include the Insomnia Severity Index and Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey. Secondary outcome measures
include wrist actigraphy, Consensus Sleep Log-Core, and World Health Organization Disability Assessment
Schedule. All participants will complete assessments at baseline, post-treatment, and 6 months post-
treatment, with primary outcome measures also administered mid-treatment at week 5 for mediation
analysis. Tests of treatment effects on the outcomes will be performed with linear mixed effects models."
10909838,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in extensive cellular structural damage followed by widespread dysfunctions in
molecular cascades; including maladaptive activation and/or dysregulation of endogenous injury-response
mechanisms. These lead to progressive tissue loss and chronic neurological deficits - secondary injury. The
maladaptive strong and persistent activation of microglia to a dysfunctional neurotoxic activation phenotype after
brain trauma, contributes to progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. A better understanding of the
processes that control secondary injury vs. repair pathways is crucial for the design of effective therapeutic
interventions that promote sustained recovery of neurological function-rehabilitation.
Our long-term goal is to devise effective disease-modifying treatments that are relevant to patients in the
Veterans Affairs system by examining non-pharmacologic therapeutic interventions focused as much on the
promotion of repair/neuroplasticity pathways, as on attenuation of secondary injury neuropathology, and that are
active in the chronic phase after TBI. Veterans are a distinct group of brain trauma patients because military TBI
features specific conditions that impact the developing neuropathology. A critical unsolved question is what
therapeuticinterventionsareeffective in the chronic phase after TBI to attenuate thepro-inflammatory and neurotoxic
microglial activation state; and thus, promote repair and restoration of neurological function - rehabilitation.
Intermittent fasting (caloric restriction) has been shown to attenuate key inflammatory pathways, stimulate
production of new neurons from stem cells (neurogenesis); as well as enhance synaptic plasticity, cognitive
function, and increase the ability of the brain to recover after trauma. Oral ketone esters have been shown to
attenuate TBI neuropathology leading to changes in brain metabolism that promote repair after brain trauma.
Dietary treatment with oral nicotinamide riboside may improve cognitive function and synaptic plasticity in
neurodegenerative diseases, as well as attenuate excitotoxicity-induced axonal degeneration.
We hypothesize that non-pharmacologic interventions including intermittent fasting; as well as oral ketone esters
and nicotinamide riboside attenuate brain and peripheral inflammation in the chronic phase after TBI. Thus,
promoting sustained neurological rehabilitation associated with neurorestorative microglia phenotypes.
We will test these novel hypotheses by addressing the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Caloric restriction attenuates the maladaptive activation of pro-inflammatory microglia, and results in
sustained neurological function rehabilitation in the chronic phase after TBI.
Aim 2: Oral ketone esters inhibit progressive neuroinflammation and foster neurological function rehabilitation in
the chronic phase after TBI.
Aim 3: Oral nicotinamide riboside reduces persistent microglia activation and promotes neurological function
recovery in the chronic phase after TBI."

10850834,"Project Abstract
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) are the most prevalent, debilitating neuro-degenerative
diseases of aging, and current treatments for neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) (e.g., agitation, aggression,
and depression) of ADRD are mixed. While non-pharmacological behavioral interventions are recommended
as first-line treatments for these NPS of ADRD, they require substantial time and resources, and may be less
effective for severely agitated, aggressive, or depressed older patients with ADRD.
 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effective and safe treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders,
including treatment-resistant depression, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. Case series and
uncontrolled naturalistic studies support preliminary evidence for the efficacy of ECT to treat severe agitation,
depression, or other NPS in ADRD. Associations of ECT with long-term improvement in NPS and geriatric
syndromes (e.g., functional disability and frailty), as well as with all-cause mortality rates among older adults
with ADRD in nursing home settings are largely unexplored. The proposed nationwide cohort study explicitly
addresses these knowledge gaps.
 Using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ 2018-2020 Medicare claims data (Parts A, B, and
D) linked to multiple data sources (e.g., Minimum Data Set [MDS] and National Death Index [NDI]), this
proposed study features the following specific aims: 1) to examine incidence and prevalence rates of ECT use
and socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with ECT use; 2) to investigate longitudinal associations
of ECT with NPS and geriatric syndromes; and 3) to examine differential risks of all-cause mortality rates by
ECT use among older adults with ADRD in nursing home settings. Longitudinal data analyses, such as
generalized linear mixed modeling and competing-risk regression methods, will be used for Aims 2 and 3. In
this nationwide cohort study, we will employ propensity-score matching and instrumental variable techniques to
adjust for both observed and unobserved confounders. Intent-to-treat and as-treated analyses will also be
conducted. Earlier studies support that ECT is associated with improvement in NPS of ADRD and our analyses
show that ECT use with presence of both depression and ADRD was associated with a lower likelihood of all-
cause mortality rates; we thus hypothesize that ECT may also be protective against geriatric syndromes.
 This is the first nationwide cohort study investigating the long-term effectiveness and safety of ECT among
older adults with ADRD in nursing home settings. The proposed study is innovative since it will provide a better
understanding of ECT use and its association with NPS, geriatric syndromes, and other related health
outcomes. Findings from this study will inform clinical guidance on ECT use in older adults with ADRD in
nursing home settings."
10861072,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating neurological disorder, and soon will reach epidemic proportions in the
context of an aging population. There is a clear need to identify persons at risk for AD pathology, so that
preventative strategies can be developed and implemented. Multiple emerging lines of research demonstrate
that sleep disturbance, and particularly excessive daytime sleepiness and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), both
increase the risk for AD pathology and dementia. Excessive daytime sleepiness is an important clinical
phenotype of OSA, with individuals with impaired alertness – a function (and salient manifestation) of
excessive sleepiness – experiencing more severe sequelae. Preliminary studies from our investigative team
demonstrate that diminished daytime alertness measured by the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) is
specifically related to AD pathology and cognition, and that OSA moderates relationships between impaired
alertness, AD pathology, and neurocognitive function. This project will advance this vital research area by
leveraging emerging Alzheimer's disease biomarkers that can be detected in blood with the wealth of unique
sleep data available in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort (WSC) Study. The WSC has followed participants since the
late 1980s, and is the only longitudinal cohort with stored biospecimens, sleep, PVT, and neurocognitive data
spanning decades to elucidate the relationships of daytime alertness and OSA with AD pathology and
cognitive decline. This investigation will prospectively collect additional blood specimens, PVT, and
neurocognitive data in a targeted sample of 450 WSC participants who are now older aged, to address three
Specific Aims with testable hypotheses supported by preliminary data. First, it will determine if impaired
neurobehavioral alertness is associated with higher levels of pathological phosphorylated tau. Second, it will
determine whether impaired neurobehavioral alertness is associated with more severe markers of
neurodegeneration. Third, it will determine if impaired neurobehavioral alertness is associated with longitudinal
cognitive trajectory. For all Aims, it is hypothesized that OSA moderates relationships between daytime
alertness and AD pathology and cognitive decline. Detailed sleep and health history data available in the WSC
importantly allows for many key covariates to be included in statistical models used for hypothesis testing.
Addressing the Specific Aims of this application will have a sizeable impact on AD and sleep research, by
linking a readily obtained objective measure of neurobehavioral alertness to longitudinal risk of AD pathology
and cognitive decline. In so doing, this project will ultimately lead to improved preventative and therapeutic
strategies that target sleep and alertness as modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease."
10663794,"Background: New policies and healthcare processes are constantly rolling out to the front lines of clinical staff
and providers across clinical conditions and multiple settings within VHA. Less is known about the investment
needed into evidence based implementation strategies by VHA healthcare organizations to achieve systematic
implementation. Moreover, implementation science has only recently begun to identify a set of implementation
strategies. Research is needed to elucidate upon the appropriate dose of the intervention strategy tailored to
the local context to modify provider behaviors' and patients' behaviors and systems of care with sustainable
implementation. Through the Precision Monitoring (PRIS-M QUERI Center) to Transform Care program we are
conducting the following implementation evaluations: 1) Conduct scalable clinical quality improvement projects
that link electronic data to provider actions and reporting; 2) Investigate the effects of providing actionable data
on care team behaviors and processes and Veteran behaviors and satisfaction; 3) Identify the implementation
strategies including the investment needed in and contextual factors that activate VHA providers, leaders, and
Veterans to use data to transform and improve care and patient outcomes; and 4) activate Veteran patients to
engage in the healthcare system to manage their health. Methods: With the ongoing input of our core VHA
Operational partners, we are accomplishing these aims via core research and quality improvement projects
that cover multiple conditions and care settings. Our projects focus on: 1) national implementation of
TeleStroke in rural VHA, 2) testing telehealth modules and electronic quality measures for improving rapid
transient ischemic attack (TIA) care, 3) decision support to deimplement inappropriate carotid ultrasound
image ordering, and 4) regional implementation of TeleRobotics in rural VHA. These projects are supported by
an Implementation and Data Core that I lead which works across all projects to facilitate efficient use of data;
usability testing of new tools; and standardized use of implementation measures, methods, and analytic
approaches. Our overarching implementation strategy focuses on activating individuals and groups to use data
to transform care, and we use the CFIR framework to plan data collection and analyses across projects to
identify core implementation strategies and contextual factors that impact how people use data to transform
care. Key partners include the Office of Specialty Care, the Office of Rural Health, the Office of Telehealth, the
Roudebush VAMC, and the VA Center for Applied Systems Engineering. We have developed a professional
video modeling a multidisciplinary VA healthcare team which uses data to activate provider changes across
services in a data driven way to improve the quality of care, and provider/patient satisfaction. Using Planning,
Goal Setting, and Reflection and Evaluation, we are promoting provider behavior modification and team
activation. Moreover, we employ the strategy of external facilitation to guide clinical teams in the VHA field. In
addition, my research on patient self-management programs attempts to reach Veterans where they are to
engage in the healthcare system to promote their optimal health and functioning. I am piloting the adaptation of
cardiac rehabilitation to delivery adjuvant recovery programs for Veterans with cerebrovascular events and
other conditions. Anticipated impacts: Our project evaluations are addressing the important implementation
questions about how best to activate providers, healthcare teams, and Veterans to improve healthcare delivery
and outcomes across clinical conditions and settings. We anticipate demonstrating the effectiveness of our
implementation strategies as well elucidating upon the tailoring to the local contexts and the adequate dose of
the strategies to achieve sustainable implementation within the VHA system with applications to other
healthcare systems. Moreover, my Veteran centered patient programs may help Veterans to engage with
providers of their care and thus improving Veteran satisfaction and outcomes of care."

The number of biomedical publications is growing at an accelerated speed. This ever-increasing
amount of scientific literature has made reading all the published articles regularly impossible
even for a very specific research area. The large volumes of scientific publication have also
made it very challenging for modern search engines to find relevant articles accurately for a
given query. Missing important prior studies in literature search can have serious consequences
such as wasting resources/time and/or making wrong scientific conclusions. Another unmet
challenge in literature search is that researchers often prefer finding articles where the queries
they use are part of the new discoveries, instead of the background knowledge in the articles.
The current search engines cannot distinguish between new discoveries and background
knowledge in an article. Related to this challenge is that it can be difficult to identify the latest
discoveries in a particular scientific area without reading all the recently published articles. To
address these challenges, one can convert unstructured text data into structured form, which can
then support highly accurate information retrieval, information integration and automated
knowledge discovery. A plausible approach for converting unstructured text into structured form
is to use named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) methods to identify the
biological entities and extract their relations to construct knowledge graphs (KGs). KGs can link
concepts within existing research to allow researchers to find connections that may have been
difficult to discover without them. The LitCoin Natural Language Processing (NLP) Challenge
was recently organized by NCATS of NIH and NASA to spur innovation by rewarding the most
creative and high-impact uses of biomedical, publication-free text to create KGs. In addition to
entities and relations, the manually annotated dataset provided by LitCoin also contains the
annotations of relations being new discoveries or background knowledge. Our team has
participated in the challenge and ranked the first place. This application aims to apply the
methods we have developed for LitCoin to all PubMed abstracts and PMC full-text articles to
build the largest scale KG to date and develop applications on top of it. Specifically, we will (1)
develop a knowledge visualization and navigation tool combined with a deep learning-powered
search engine we developed previously; (2) develop advanced relation search functions to allow
knowledge discovery applications such as drug repurposing and adverse effect discovery; (3)
develop functions that allow users to search specifically the new discoveries in articles; and (4)
develop functions that return the latest discoveries in a scientific area for a given time period."

In the last few decades, the importance of bacteria, not only as pathogens but also as beneficial organisms,
has been elucidated. However, it has become clear that bacterial diversity and evolution is much more
complex than initially thought. Because most systems do not allow for the integration of multiple approaches,
there are still many fundamental questions that remain to be answered about bacterial evolution. Specifically,
how bacteria evolve in the natural environment and what drives the evolution of different lifestyles in bacteria.
From an evolutionary perspective, opportunistic bacteria are complex entities because of their wide-range of
lifestyles. Their ability to be free-living, commensal, and pathogenic means that these organisms are highly
adaptable, but the factors that influence their evolution remain a mystery. Understanding opportunistic bacterial
evolution is important because they are responsible for causing dangerous hospital-acquired infections
worldwide and are often multidrug resistant superbugs.
 Studies of bacterial evolution are primarily conducted using comparative genomic approaches or in vitro
experimental evolution. However, the versatility and complexity of opportunistic bacteria, as well as their
relationships with animal hosts, requires more realistic experimental settings. Here, we have developed a
unique research program that will integrate multiple approaches, including in silico, in vitro, and in vivo
analyses. Key to our research is our specific experimental evolution framework to study the interactions
between four key players: i) an opportunistic bacterium, ii) their environmental predators, iii) an animal host
and iv) the animal host microbiota. Our ability to pursue a multi-approach strategy is due to our tractable model
systems. Our bacterial model systems, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are ubiquitous
environmental and multi-drug resistant opportunistic pathogens of humans as well as many other organisms.
We will use honeybees as our host model system (Apis mellifera), which are optimal for this research because
they offer a natural environment in which to study opportunistic bacterial evolution and host-microbe
interactions that is tractable, cost-effective, highly replicable, and can be easily manipulated. Importantly, the
honeybee microbiota is a stable community that can also be easily manipulated. Our novel approach and
systems will allow us to address many fundamental gaps in our understanding of bacterial evolution, including
the forces that drive the evolution of opportunistic bacteria that exhibit changing lifestyles. In particular, we will
identify what genes are involved in versatile lifestyles, what adaptive forces and associated tradeoffs are
driving the evolution of opportunistic bacteria, and what functions are exapted during exposure to fluctuating
environments and changing selective pressures. Results will have important fundamental implications but also
health implications as they will reveal traits important for host colonization and virulence, which can be used for
the development of new strategies for combating multidrug resistant opportunistic bacterial infections."

 Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), such as methamphetamine (METH) are highly addictive and are the
second most used illicit drugs in the world. Even though ATS production in the US has dramatically increased
and stimulant use remain an important public health, financial, and legal issue, there are no proven
pharmacotherapies to treat ATS use disorders (AUD) due to a limited understanding of the brain circuits
underlying AUD and their complex mechanisms of action. Although many ATS increase both brain
norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA), and have higher affinities for the NE transporter (NET) than the DA
transporter, far less attention has been paid to the role of central NE circuits as a potential target for treatment
of AUD. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have highlighted NE in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
(BNST) as an important contributor to substance abuse, withdrawal, and stress-induced reinstatement of drug
seeking. NE transmission in the ventral (v)BNST, which primarily originates from the nucleus of the solitary
tract (NST), integrates information from reward and stress related stimuli and mediates subsequent behavioral
responses. However, little is known about how the NST-NE vBNST pathway is implicated in AUD and how it
contributes to behavioral changes due to methodological limitations in selectively studying NE in the
anatomically small/complex and neurochemically heterogeneous BNST. Furthermore, the BNST is sexually
dimorphic and much smaller in volume (2.5X less for humans) in females than males, yet little is known about
sex differences in the NST-NE vBNST system and its effect on AUD.
 Aim 1 of this proposal will (i) identify anatomical and neurochemical differences in the NST-NEvBNST
system between male and female rats and (ii) characterize the effects of METH on NE regulation in the NST
and vBNST and the correlation of the NE system with stress-induced behavioral changes. Aim 2 will determine
the functional role of the NST-NEvBNST pathway in animal models of stress-induced METH seeking
(relapse/craving) by chemogenetically modulating this pathway in METH self-administration paradigms.
 To achieve these Aims, we propose an innovative and integrative approach utilizing fast-scan cyclic
voltammetry and chemogenetic modulation of NST-NE projection neurons to the vBNST in wild-type rats. This
study will fill an important gap in our understanding of the NST-NEvBNST pathway and its contributions to
the chronic effects of METH-induced neurochemical and behavioral changes and its distinct sex differences.
These results will provide insight into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of ATS use and may lead to
novel therapeutics for of AUD using sex specific treatment strategies."

More than 1 million U.S. youth sustain a concussion each year, and up to 30% experience persistent post-
concussive symptoms (PPCS) such as headache, fatigue or difficulty focusing lasting one month or more.
PPCS can interfere with normal adolescent development, resulting in issues with social and emotional
dysfunction and even school failure. Despite these concerns, few evidence based treatments are available for
youth with PPCS. We have conducted extensive work using a collaborative care (CC) framework integrating
mental health care into a medical model, and we adapted this approach for youth with PPCS, combining
concussion-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (cf-CBT), parenting skills training (PST) and care
management (CM) to create wraparound treatment for youth with PPCS that could be delivered either in-
person or virtually (using video conferencing software). We completed an R01 funded RCT with the CC
approach, finding effectiveness for treating youth with PPCS, with improvements in concussive symptoms and
quality of life at one year, and 60% of participants completing the intervention completely virtually. Of note, this
intervention is unique in that two of the components are focused on parents or parents and youth together
(PST, CM), and only one of the components (cf-CBT) is solely youth focused. We are now proposing to
optimize and refine the CC approach, conducting a high efficiency MOST (multiphase optimization strategy)
trial to assess the contribution of each of the three components (cf-CBT, PST and CM) to effectiveness of the
intervention, thereby allowing us to streamline the intervention to only include active components. The analysis
will be 23 factorial, with three intervention components and two levels of each (present or absent), resulting in 8
possible treatment combinations. The benefit of the MOST approach is that it combines all youth who receive a
component, allowing us to assess all treatment components with only a modest sample size. We will recruit
368 youth with PPCS from two geographic locations (Seattle and Dallas), randomizing them to one of 8
treatment groups. Youth and/or parents will attend treatment sessions via video conferencing software over
three months, and complete surveys regarding primary outcomes (concussive symptoms and health-related
quality of life) and secondary outcomes (sleep, pain, mood and parental distress) at 3, 6 and 12 months. We
will also assess potential mediators and moderators to allow for future tailoring and refinement. At the
completion of this study, we will have a completely optimized and refined intervention for youth with PPCS
ready for large scale implementation and dissemination."

This application is concerned with the study of epigenetics events affecting multiple sclerosis (MS) risk

10794375,"The picornaviruses are a family of small positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that cause a wide range of diseases at an annual cost well into the hundreds of million dollars. Members include paralyzing poliovirus and enterovirus D68, the heart disease causing coxsackie B3 virus, and rhinoviruses that cause more than half the occurrences of the common cold. These viruses share a life cycle where RNA replication and viral assembly occurs in large membrane anchored replication complexes assembled and the replication process is driven by a virally encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol) that is responsible for the synthesis of all viral RNA. This research project is focused on the structure and assembly of the viral replication centers and on structure-function studies of the viral polymerases to understand mechanisms that control elongation rates and replication fidelity. We will use biochemical and structural biology approaches to study how the fidelity checkpoint used in 3Dpol was rearranged as these polymerases evolved to support large-genome coronavirus replication, providing novel information about functional constraints to help us understanding pathways for virus evolution. In a second aim we will elucidate the mechanisms whereby RNAs interact with and stimulate viral proteases, a finding that suggests viral RNA elements can regulated polyprotein processing the context of a viral replication center. Last, we will solve the structure of the picornaviral uridylylation complex that generates the VPg-pUpU primers used for all RNA synthesis by the viral 3Dpol polymerase."
10819585,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most mammals, including humans, navigate a life motivated and shaped by a drive to seek rewards such as
food, water, and social interactions. Social stimuli can act as positive reinforcers, driving animals to pursue and
interact with other members of their own species (e.g., people regularly hanging out with friends or a mouse
repeatedly visiting to investigate a novel conspecific). Significantly, deficits in motivation to seek socially
rewarding stimuli and deficits in social reward processing are associated with several disorders, such as Autism
Spectrum Disorders. While the neural substrates underlying non-social reward-related behaviors (e.g., food
rewards) have been studied extensively, similar studies have been more difficult for social rewards because of
the inherent complexity of social interactions. It is unclear if there are differences in how the brain processes
social versus non-social rewards. Additionally, although intranasal oxytocin delivery alleviates social motivation
deficits in human subjects with autism, how oxytocin modulates neural circuits mediating social reward-related
behaviors remains poorly understood. Therefore, addressing these questions will have immense consequences
for human health.
We hope to address these gaps in knowledge by combining cellular resolution imaging techniques and
optogenetics with a novel operant behavioral paradigm to thoroughly and systematically map how social and
non-social rewards are represented in the medial prefrontal cortex (AIM 1a). We will determine if the mPFC
reward representations are modulated by the internal state of the animal. (AIM 1b). We will evaluate how oxytocin
inputs modulate social and non-social reward representations in the mPFC by imaging the activity of mPFC
neurons while silencing oxytocin inputs to the mPFC (AIM 2). Finally, we will determine if social reward
representations such as proximity of social reward, valence, and reward prediction error are functionally
clustered in mPFC projection populations (AIM 3). In summary, this research will help us identify differences and
similarities in how the brain encodes social rewards versus non-social rewards and how the animal's internal
state modulates these representations. Additionally, given the promising therapeutic possibility of using
intranasal oxytocin administration to children and adults with autism, elucidation of the role of the oxytocin on
mPFC function will be a valuable addition to the autism research community."
10840994,"Project summary: Ants are social insects that live in colonies of morphologically and physiologically different
individuals that are essentially identical genetically, making ants an attractive system to study epigenetic
phenomena. Ant colonies contain many workers that perform most tasks but do not lay eggs, while queens are
solely responsible for reproduction. Remarkably, queens live up to 10X longer than workers, in sharp contrast
with most animals in which high reproduction leads to shortened lifespan. The jumping ant Harpegnathos
saltator exhibits a high degree of aging plasticity: In the absence of the queen, some workers can become
pseudo-queens called gamergates. Gamergates dramatically change their behavior, produce eggs, reconfigure
their brain and most dramatically, have a 5X lifespan extension. Remarkably, when placed in the presence of a
genuine queen, gamergates transition back into workers with an accompanying shortened lifespan. We
established Harpegnathos as a model system that can be manipulated with CRISPR/Cas9, providing a unique
opportunity to study the molecular mechanisms that control aging, as well as the crosstalk between aging and
reproduction.
 Using a combination of transcriptomics as well as both ex vivo and in vivo pharmacological manipulations, we
discovered that gamergates have an elevated production of Insulin accompanied by differential regulation of the
two branches of the Insulin signaling pathway (IIS) in target tissues. The MAPK branch of IIS is activated in the
gamergate fat body and ovary, while the AKT branch is repressed by extracellular “anti-Insulin” proteins, ImpL2.
As MAPK activity is required for egg-laying, we hypothesize that repression of the AKT branch contributes to the
dramatically extended longevity in gamergates.
 We now propose to investigate the molecular mechanism of ImpL2 function and test its role in aging. First,
we will identify the source and organismal distribution of ImpL2, and then experimentally modulate its levels and
mutate ImpL2 to examine the effect(s) on IIS and increased metabolism for egg formation. Furthermore, we will
explore the molecular interactions of ImpL2 and the mechanisms that lead to the specific inhibition of the AKT
(but not MAPK) IIS pathway. Next, we will test the effect of ImpL2 on aging in manipulated animals, assessing a
panel of aging biomarkers and extend our investigations to another anti-Insulin protein, ALS. Moreover, tissue-
specific manipulation of ImpL2 expression in Drosophila will address its potentially conserved effect on
reproduction and lifespan in a powerful model system. Finally, we will extend our study to the brain remodeling
events that accompany and orchestrate the social transition. We will perform single-cell mRNA sequencing of
the different social groups/ages to survey age-associated changes in the Harpegnathos brain and identify
candidate regulators responsible for delayed aging in gamergates. We will exploit the transcriptomic data to test
how specific genetic functions modulate brain circuits and aging."

The remarkable heterogeneity of developmental neuropsychiatric disorders has been a major barrier for
understanding disease mechanisms. Taking a ‘genetics first’ approach (i.e., ascertaining patients based on a
known, homogeneous genetic etiology) may allow us to overcome the barriers posed by this complexity. Notably,
a 1.5-2.6 Megabase deletion at the Chromosome 22q11.2 locus results in the most common known
microdeletion disorder, 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22qDel), which is among the greatest known genetic risk
factors for schizophrenia (SCZ). As 22qDel can be detected very early in development, it allows a unique
opportunity for prospective investigation of early biomarkers of psychosis, long before disease-related processes
begin to unfold. Adding to the evidence that this genomic region is highly relevant to the development of
psychosis, the reciprocal 22q11.2 duplication (22qDup) is significantly less common in SCZ cases than in the
general population, suggesting the first putative protective mutation for SCZ. This proposal is for five years of
funding to continue our prospective longitudinal study of mechanisms relevant to neuropsychiatric disease risk
in 22q11.2 copy number variants (CNVs). Our work to date supports an emerging framework of a lifelong
biological vulnerability in 22qDel due to haploinsufficiency for specific genes critical for brain development, in
combination with background genetic risk. This vulnerability sets the stage for subsequent events during
adolescence, including changes in dendritic arborization and increased disruption of thalamocortical circuitry
(across sleep and wake), that lead to escalating clinical and cognitive manifestations. In this second competitive
renewal application we propose to continue our accelerated longitudinal design, prospectively following our large
cohort of youth with 22q11.2 deletions (n=90) through the highest risk period for illness onset, compared to both
demographically comparable typically developing controls (n=45) and youth with reciprocal 22q11.2 duplications
(n=45). Building on our previous findings, our primary goals are: (1) To investigate 22q11.2-related progressive
abnormalities in structural and functional brain biomarkers associated with psychosis risk, in order to identify
developmentally-specific periods of regional and circuit-specific structural and functional neuroanatomic
changes; 2) Using novel methods for real-world assessment of sleep physiology (electroencephalogram
headbands), to pursue the hypothesis that impoverished sleep spindle activity is linked with thalamocortical
network disruption, observed via resting state functional MRI during wake, and increased psychotic
symptomatology, suggesting a common mechanism; and (3) Given our findings that divergent psychosis risk is
underpinned by opposing effects of 22qDel and 22qDup on brain structure, to probe mechanisms underlying
22q11.2 gene dosage effects on neurobehavioral phenotypes. Collectively, these findings will shed light on
genetic and developmental mechanisms underlying divergent clinical outcomes, and may inform new scalable
biomarkers."

The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a member of the Flavivirus genus that includes other arthropod-borne human pathogens
such as dengue virus and West Nile virus, among others. ZIKV’s link to microcephaly in newborn infants and the
Guillan-Barré syndrome in adults has invigorated measures to develop a vaccine, as well as efforts to develop
antivirals based on targeting enzymatic activities central to the life cycle and survival of ZIKV. One such
enzymatic activity is encoded by the methyltransferase (MTase) domain, located at the N-terminus of the
nonstructural protein NS5. Taking a structure informed approach, we have succeeded in identifying a novel
“lead-like” compound (MS2045) for the inhibition of ZIKV’s NS5 MTase activity and for blocking its replication.
MS2045 provides a basis for further chemistry and the development of even more potent inhibitors. In aim 1,
we will a) design MS2045 analogs with the capacity to establish specific interactions with unique amino acids of
ZIKV MTase as a means to provide additional selectivity against the human RNA 5’-cap MTases; b) chemically
synthesize these analogs and produce them to a purity of 95% for in vitro and cell-based assays, and for
structural studies. In aim 2, we will a) perform biophysical assays to assess the ability of these analogs to
selectively bind the ZIKV NS5-MTase as compared to the human RNA 5’-cap MTases and test their ability to
inhibit RNA methylation; b) test these analogs in viral cell-based assays to assess their efficacy in blocking viral
replication; c) determine structures ZIKV NS5-Mtase with select analogs for additional, iterative rounds of
structure activity relationships (SARs). Collectively, these studies will help to identify analogs of MS2045 that
can be potentially developed into potent and selective inhibitors of NS5-MTase from ZIKV (and other pathogenic
flaviviruses)"

 Dominant mutations in the human GRN gene cause haploinsufficiency in Progranulin (PGRN) protein levels
and are a leading cause of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with aggregation of RNA binding protein TDP-43
(FTLD-TDP). In addition, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in GRN has been identified as a risk factor for
AD and Limbic predominant, Age-related TDP-43 Encephalopathy (LATE), a major cause of memory
impairments in patients over 90 years old. Despite the critical role of PGRN in brain aging, however, the exact
mechanism by which PGRN haploinsufficiency promotes neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. By
analyzing aging cohorts of Grn knockout (Grn-/-) and humanized GrnR493X/R493X knockin mice, we have shown that
PGRN-deficient microglia produce more complement proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines to promote
neuronal cell death and TDP-43 proteinopathy during brain aging. Interestingly, our ongoing work shows that
blocking complement activation and proinflammatory cytokines TNFa and IL-1a does not completely mitigate
neurodegeneration, but rather uncover late-onset microglial pathology characterized by profound accumulation
of lipids in Grn-/-, Grn-/-;C1qa-/-;C3-/-, and Grn-/-;C1qa-/-;Tnf-/-;Il1a-/- microglia. Using lipidomics and subcellular
fractionation, we further show that loss of PGRN causes severe blockade in the endolysosomal trafficking of
lipids in Grn-/- microglia, which interferes with lysosome-mediated degradation of lipid droplets and increased
production of proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids. Together, our results broach the hypothesis that PGRN
deficiency causes profound endolysosomal trafficking defects of lipids in microglia and astrocytes to promote
neuronal vulnerability in neurodegeneration. To test this hypothesis, we propose to (1) delineate the mechanism
of endolysosomal trafficking and secretory autophagy that promote lipid-mediated toxicity in Grn-/- microglia, (2)
characterize the role of lipid-dependent and -independent mechanisms in promoting neurotoxicity in Grn-/-
astrocytes, and (3) delineate the contributions of lipids to glial toxicity in FTLD-GRN using comparative snRNA-
seq, IPSC-derived organoids and postmortem tissues. The proposed parallel human-mouse studies will uncover
the contributions of lipid-mediated toxicity in highly disease vulnerable regions in Grn-/- mice and FTLD-GRN will
uncover critical mechanisms that promote glial pathology and neurodegeneration during brain aging and lead to
novel therapeutic targets for ADRD."

Sleep is a basic biological need and sufficient sleep is required for physical and mental health. Reduced or
disordered sleep contributes to an array of metabolic, inflammatory, cardiovascular, and neurological
disorders, reduces productivity and performance, and is a threat to public safety. Understanding the control
of sleep is therefore critical for human health and society. Sleep pressure (or sleepiness) has long been
thought to be driven by substances that accumulate in the brain, where they promote sleep by acting on
neural centers of sleep control. The identification of molecular mediators of sleep pressure in the brain would
be highly significant, in that it would provide obvious targets for the improvement of daily sleep. Here we
propose a large and unbiased screen for molecules that the fit the criteria for sleep promoting substances
that drive daily changes in sleep pressure and promote homeostatic increases in sleep following sleep
deprivation. To this end we have developed methods to differentiate molecules that rise with increasing
sleep pressure from those that rise in direct response to the mechanical perturbation necessary to keep
animal subjects awake. In doing so we have addressed a fundamental challenge to the identification of
molecular correlates of sleep pressure. Using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization – Time of Flight
Mass Spectrometry, we will identify molecules whose abundance tracks sleep pressure within the central
brain, where sleep is controlled. The identification of candidate sleep substances will set the stage for new
mechanistic investigations of sleep in Drosophila whose aim is to identify conserved molecular mechanisms
of its homeostatic control. Given the existence of sleep-like states across the animal kingdom and the
presence of homeostatic sleep control even in animals with extremely simple nervous systems, discoveries
made in Drosophila are likely to reveal conserved features physiological systems regulating sleep."

Poverty puts children at risk for developmental delays, lower school achievement and educational attainment,
and unfavorable labor market and health outcomes. The Baby’s First Years (BFY) project is the first large-scale
randomized controlled trial in the U.S. to estimate the impact of poverty reduction on children’s development
and health. Launched in 2018 (NICHD R01HD087384), BFY recruited 1,000 low-income mothers and their
newborn infants in four metropolitan areas. Mothers were randomized to receive a monthly unconditional cash
transfer of either $333 (“high-cash gift group”) or $20 (“low-cash gift group”) for the first 4 years and 4 months
(52 months) of the child’s life. Participants have been followed up annually around the children’s birthdays to
measure child development and family life. In this renewal, with funding already in hand for a two-year
extension of the cash gifts, BFY has the opportunity to study the impact of poverty reduction for an
unparalleled duration, across the first six years of life. The continuation of the project is driven by a need to
understand whether continuous monthly cash transfers will improve low-income children’s development at the
start of formal schooling. To accomplish this, we will collect two lab-based waves of data, at ages 6 and 8. We
will assess high-cash/low-cash group differences at age 6 on measures of academic achievement skills as well
as cognitive, self-regulation, and socio-emotional development. We will additionally assess high-cash/low-cash
group differences in measures of brain activity and stress physiology. At age 8, we will investigate whether
children’s learning and developmental trajectories have been altered in ways that generate persistent impacts,
20 months after the cessation of the payments. The study will also measure family contexts based on two
pathways by which poverty is theorized to affect children: an investment pathway (household expenditures;
maternal work; activities with children, early care and education arrangements) and a stress pathway
(economic hardship; parental relationship quality, maternal mental health, stress, and parenting quality). At
both ages 6 and 8, we will assess high-cash/low-cash group differences in these investment and stress
pathways."

This is an application for the first five-year renewal (years 6-10) of the Multidisciplinary Research Training to
Reduce Inequalities in Cardiovascular Health (METRIC) T32 for predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows at Emory
University. The goal of the METRIC T32 program is to train diverse candidates in the study of cardiovascular
health inequalities broadly defined, based on factors such as race/ethnicity, sex/gender, socioeconomic status,
geographical residence, healthcare access, and physical/mental disability, with a focus on the underlying
biological, behavioral and environmental mechanisms. A distinguishing feature of our program is the utilization
of a multidisciplinary approach to expose trainees to multiple methods and research areas, from epidemiology
and biostatistics to behavioral and social sciences, biological sciences, and health policy and implementation.
Each trainee has a primary mentor but works within a mentoring team with diverse expertise. A maximum of 5
predoctoral and 5 postdoctoral trainees will be in the program at any time point, each supported for an average
of 3 years for predocs and 2 years for postdocs. Training will include multidisciplinary mentoring along with
coursework, inter-departmental seminars, hands-on research, grant writing and career development. Our main
source of predoctoral applicants will continue to be PhD students entering the School of Public Health's
doctoral programs. Postdoctoral fellows will be MDs pursuing a research career in cardiovascular disease, or
PhD graduates in epidemiology, nutrition, behavioral sciences, environmental sciences, health policy, or other
relevant areas. Postdoctoral trainees will have the opportunity to obtain a MS in Clinical Research. In the past
funding cycle all our training slots were filled, and we have utilized three supplementary diversity slots. The
program shows a strong track record for successful training and career development, promoted by solid
collaborations among the Rollins School of Public Health, the School of Medicine, the School of Nursing, and
the Morehouse School of Medicine. Of all the fellows appointed, 50% are from underrepresented racial/ethnic
minority groups. Our program responds to several emphasis areas for NHLBI T32 programs, including
multidisciplinary training, collaborative research, diversity of trainees, quantitative sciences, and translation
research, with strong emphasis on mentorship and career development. Addressing cardiovascular health
inequities is a top priority of the strategic vision of the NHLBI's Division of Cardiovascular Sciences. The
ultimate goal of this program is to prepare diverse individuals for leadership positions in biomedical and health
care research in order to build capacity for research and translation to reduce inequalities in health and health
care for cardiovascular disease."
10893376,"In normal hearts, the transverse tubules (t-tubules) concentrate L-type calcium channels
(LTCCs) to initiate the beat-to-beat intracellular calcium transients which contribute to the regulation of
cardiac contraction and relaxation. An altered calcium transient is a key pathophysiological sign of
failing heart. However, mechanisms of maintenance of LTCC expression at t-tubule microdomains for
optimal calcium-induced-calcium-release (CICR) remain poorly understood. Understanding the dynamic
regulation of calcium handling microdomains at t-tubules, and in particular LTCC regulation at the
microdomains, is needed to understand the pathophysiology of failing hearts and to identify new
pathways and molecules that can be targeted for heart failure therapy development.
 The overall objective of this MPI application is to further our mechanistic understanding of how
LTCC expression at t-tubule cBIN1-microdomains is maintained and why LTCC localization is altered in
heart failure. We will explore the central hypothesis that homeostatic LTCC expression at t-tubules is
highly dynamic and maintained by both internal delivery and external delivery. We expect that the
internal delivery is determined by intracellular actin reservoirs of LTCCs organized at Z-disks by a
newly identified actin nucleator GJA1-20k (Aim 1, RMS). We also expect that there is a local
extracellular reservoir of cBIN1 vesicles (Aim 2, TTH), which feed t-tubule cBIN1-microdomains from
other regions of the heart to modulate LTCC expression at t-tubule surfaces. In heart failure, both
sources are depleted yet could be exogenously restored.
 The resources of a membrane biology lab (TTH) and a trafficking lab focused on heart failure
progression (RMS) are combined in this application for the proposed research plan. The rationale that
underlies the proposed research is that LTCCs at t-tubule microdomains are dynamically regulated
from both inside and out, are reduced in heart failure, and can be restored presenting a novel therapy
for heart failure.
 The proposed research is innovative because it will identify new regulatory mechanisms of
remodeled myocardium during heart failure progression, and lead to the establishment of molecules
and pathways that can be targeted for therapy development. The proposal has a strong premise
because it is based on extensive published and preliminary data from successful in vitro cell-free
studies, intact cell line and primary cardiomyocyte studies, and successful genetic and in vivo animal
heart failure models. The significance is high because it will lead to development of new therapeutic
strategies that will allow preservation and restoration of efficient excitation-contraction coupling in
diseased hearts."

 Cancer is primarily a disease of the old. While this is due in part to the sequential acquisition of genomic
alterations, aging is also associated with a constellation of changes that could impact tumor initiation and growth.
These “hallmarks of aging” involve diverse pathways that impinge on carcinogenesis and lead to systemic
changes. However, despite the very close association between aging and cancer, or perhaps because of it, very
little is known about how cancer cell-intrinsic, microenvironmental, and systemic age-related changes impact
cancer initiation and growth. Genetically engineered mouse models uniquely enable the introduction of defined
genetic alterations into normal adult cells with defined temporal control. Human lung cancer has been modeled
using genetically engineered mouse models, and these tumors recapitulate many features of early-stage human
lung adenocarcinoma. To increase the scope and precision of in vivo cancer modeling, we integrated
conventional genetically engineered mouse models, CRISPR/Cas9-based somatic genome engineering, and
quantitative genomics with statistical approaches. Tumor barcoding coupled with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene
inactivation and high-throughput barcode sequencing (Tuba-seq) enables quantitative analysis of the effects of
large panels of genes on tumor initiation and various facets of autochthonous tumor growth. These models can
thus distinguish the effects of aging from mutational events while affording a level of precision that allows us to
detect differences in tumor suppressor function across age contexts. In Aim 1, we will quantify the interaction
between age and tumor suppressor gene function. Our in vivo experiments will define whether aging increases
or decreases the absolute efficiency of tumor initiation and uncover the impact of aging on the importance of
diverse tumor suppressor genes on tumor initiation and growth. In Aim 2. we will determine how the lung tumor
microenvironment and lung cancer cells themselves change with age. We will elucidate the impact of tumor
genotype on the microenvironment across age and determine whether age-dependent changes in growth are
accompanied by dramatic differences in cancer cell state. In Aim 3, we will disentangle cell-autonomous
differences in tumors developing in young and aged mice from effects on tumor suppressor function driven
specifically by aging of the local tissue and systemic host environments. These experiments will provide insight
into whether age-dependent genotype-specific effects are largely cancer cell-intrinsic or driven by the shifts in
the microenvironment or whole organism environment. By permuting cancer cell age and genotype, as well as
microenvironment and host age, we will gain an unprecedented understanding of the contribution of these factors
to multiple aspects of lung carcinogenesis. Ultimately, these findings could have important implication for cancer
prevention, detection, and treatment."
10893459,"Age is a major risk factor for high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) with an average age at diagnosis of
63. Ovulation and aging induce inflammatory changes in the fallopian tube microenvironment, the origin of most
HGSOC. Over time, cells become senescent and secrete regulatory factors known as the senescence
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP-induced changes in the local microenvironment have been
implicated in cancer promotion. However, the role of the aging microenvironment in ovarian cancer initiation is
unknown creating a major barrier to effective early detection and prevention strategies for this deadly disease.
The goal of this proposal is to define the impact of aging on interactions between stromal cells and cancer
initiating cells (CIC) that drive ovarian cancer formation. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (MSC) are multipotent
stromal progenitor cells critical to tissue homeostasis across the lifespan. In cancer, MSCs undergo epigenomic
reprogramming to become pro-tumorigenic cancer associated MSCs (CA-MSCs). The pro-tumorigenic CA-MSC
phenotype is driven by the activation of the Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) transcription factor. WT1 induces the secretion
of CA-MSC derived BMP4 which increases the pool of ovarian CICs. Preliminary data demonstrate that with
increasing age, MSCs can express WT1 and adopt a cancer promoting phenotype even before cancer starts.
We have termed these cells ‘high risk’ MSCs (hrMSCs). Preliminary data indicate that hrMSCs (i) recapitulate
the CA-MSC phenotype and are enriched in the stroma of pre-malignant epithelial cells, (ii) secrete SASP-like
proteins which both induce epithelial cell DNA damage and support the survival of DNA damaged epithelial cells
and (iii) support established cancer cell growth. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) may be critical to CA-
MSC/hrMSC formation. In a clinical trial Metformin, which increases AMPK, reversed the CA-MSC phenotype in
some patients correlating with improved survival. Preliminary data shows a more potent, novel AMPK activator,
BC1618, alters the hrMSC secretome. We hypothesize that aging induces epigenetic changes which convert
MSCs to hrMSCs and that hrMSCs create a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment that supports the growth of
ovarian CICs. Our collaborative team with expertise in aging, stromal stem cells and CICs propose to: 1)
Determine the impact of aging on the fallopian tube MSC phenotype and spatial relationship to CICs. We
hypothesize that aged MSCs obtain a high risk phenotype through altered DNA methylation and support adjacent
CIC formation. 2) Determine the impact of aged hrMSCs on CIC formation and ovarian cancer progression. We
hypothesize that aged hrMSCs promote CIC formation and progression via WT1-mediated BMP4 and SASP
secretion. 3) Target aging hrMSCs to limit ovarian cancer formation. We hypothesize that the AMPK activator,
BC1618, through altering age-related MSC epigenetic changes, will decrease hrMSC formation and ovarian
cancer initiation. This work will broaden our understanding of ovarian cancer initiation by defining the critical role
of aging stroma in CIC formation and offer new avenues for early detection and prevention strategies."

 Non-segmented negative strand (NNS) RNA viruses are highly diversified eukaryotic viruses including
significant human pathogens (e.g., rabies, Nipah, Ebola). Most NNS RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of
host cells, whereas Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), a unique NNS RNA virus, replicates in the nucleus. BoDV-
1 is a causative agent of fatal neurological diseases in animals and humans, although in rare cases. Interestingly,
endogenous bornavirus-like elements were discovered as fossils of ancient bornaviruses in genomes of various
vertebrates including humans, indicating that there have been interactions between bornaviruses and vertebrate
hosts during evolution. Thus, elucidation of unique strategies of bornaviruses to replicate in host cells is important
not only to understand the basic biology of bornaviruses but also to develop therapeutic targets against
bornaviruses with zoonotic potential. The goal of this project is to elucidate the enzymatic roles of the RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex composed of the BoDV-1 L and P proteins in transcription and
replication. We hypothesize that (1) the BoDV-1 L protein has enzymatic activities to carry out genome
transcription and replication and (2) the multimeric P protein plays structural roles in maintaining a
transcriptionally active state of the L protein. These hypotheses will be tested by the specific aims to elucidate
the roles of (1) the BoDV-1 L protein in RNA synthesis and processing and (2) the P protein in the formation of
a transcriptionally active RdRp complex. In Aim 1, we will dissect the mechanisms underlying the formation of
the unique termini of the genome and the 5′-terminal cap core structure on mRNAs with the BoDV-1 L-P complex.
In Aim 2, we will solve a 3D structure of the BoDV-1 L-P complex and investigate the mechanism of the activation
of the L protein with the multimeric P protein in RNA synthesis. Collectively, this study will advance our
understanding of how the L protein of BoDV-1 carries out RNA synthesis and processing together with its co-
factor P protein. Furthermore, this study will reveal structural similarities and differences between RdRp
complexes of nuclear- and cytoplasmic- replicating NNS RNA viruses."

The pathogenesis of heart failure is linked to systemic metabolic dysfunction, a comorbidity likely involving
peripheral organs, and resulting in insulin resistance in patients with and without diabetes. This study focuses
on the reciprocal response of adipose tissue to pathological stress on the heart and will investigate how
adipose tissue activity affects cardiac metabolic remodeling. This proposal originates from novel findings by
each of the MPI laboratories. We have identified transient changes in adipose tissue plasticity during the
pathogenesis of decompensated cardiac hypertrophy in response to pathological stress alone, absent any
primary metabolic stress, such as diabetes, nutrient overload, or obesity. This finding and our unpublished data
implicate cardiac natriuretic peptides (NP) as mediators of adipose activation and show that NPs are induced
by a reduction in long chain fatty acid (LCFA) oxidation by the heart, even without pathological stress.
Preliminary data reveal a profound, sex-specific array of early responses in white (WAT) and brown (BAT)
adipose tissue activity to cardiac pressure overload that include beiging of WAT and induction of a lipolytic
phenotype with cold exposure. While the cardiac responses to pathological stress include maladaptive
remodeling of lipid metabolism, the effects of adipose plasticity on the cardiac lipid profile during the
development of pathological hypertrophy are virtually unexplored. Thus, we hypothesize that: 1) the
metabolic response of reduced fatty acid oxidation in the heart during pathological stress induces plasticity of
WAT that is mediated by cardiac NPs in a sex-specific manner, distinct from β-adrenergic stimulation, with
downstream effects on glucose tolerance; and 2) sustained beiging of WAT and activation of BAT confer
cardioprotection against adverse cardiac metabolic remodeling. The research design supports three specific
aims: 1. Elucidate effects of adipocyte adrenergic activation on WAT beiging, and responses of cardiac LCFA
metabolism during TAC with adipose adrenergic activation and inhibition; 2. Determine whether adipose
plasticity results from NP effects in direct response to TAC or from the metabolic shift of reduced LCFA
oxidation in male and female mice; 3. Investigate a potential cardioprotective role of adipose browning on the
lipid profile of failing hearts. The overall objectives are to: 1) determine the reciprocal metabolic responses
between the pathologically stressed heart and adipose tissue via cardiac NP production and adipokine/lipokine
release (namely 12,13-diHOME), respectively; 2) elucidate the consequences of sex differences in the
responses of adipose tissue and myocardium to cardiac stress; and 3) explore the potential for WAT beiging or
BAT activation to provide cardioprotection via metabolic signaling. The findings will contribute new insights into
the adipose responses and contributions to metabolic remodeling of the heart during the pathogenesis of
decompensated cardiac hypertrophy, with the potential to identify targets for remediating the progression to
overt heart failure and improving peripheral and systemic metabolic dysfunction."

Opportunistic fungal infection of immune-compromised individuals is an escalating world health problem.
Recent lethal outbreaks of multi drug-resistant Candida auris in hospitals and the rise of drug resistance in
normally benign commensal fungi like C. glabrata highlight the severity of the problem. Current treatment
options for fungal infections are limited to a few antifungal drug classes that are becoming increasingly
ineffective. There is a pressing need for new molecular targets for antifungal development to deal with drug-
resistant pathogens. This project will characterize a newly identified C. albicans virulence and drug resistance
factor, the Cdc14 protein phosphatase. Our recent work has uncovered novel roles for C. albicans Cdc14 in
regulating cell wall integrity, septation, echinocandin sensitivity, and hyphal development, all processes tied to
virulence. Importantly, even modest reduction in Cdc14 activity level severely compromises virulence in a
mouse model of invasive candidiasis. In contrast, Cdc14 is dispensable for normal development, growth, and
cell division in animals. Cdc14 is highly conserved in fungi and its unique and strict active site specificity
implies that development of potent and highly selective inhibitors should be achievable, something that has
been challenging with other protein phosphatases. Our overall objective is to characterize the mechanisms by
which Cdc14 regulates virulence-associated biological processes in C. albicans. In Aim 1 we will characterize
Cdc14 regulation of cell wall integrity and septation. In Aim 2 we will characterize Cdc14 regulation of hyphal
initiation and maintenance. In Aim 3 we will characterize the mechanisms by which Cdc14 itself is regulated by
cell wall stress and hypha-inducing signals. In Aims 1 and 2 we will employ unbiased omics approaches to
identify the relevant substrates of Cdc14 and the transcriptional circuits under Cdc14 control. In Aim 1 we will
directly characterize the cell wall defects arising from Cdc14-deficiency. We will also test specific models for
Cdc14 function in promoting cell wall integrity and hyphal initiation in Aims 1 and 2, respectively. In Aim 3 we
will focus on phosphoregulation of the disordered Cdc14 C-terminal tail, which is a hub for integration of
regulatory signals in model fungi. We will use quantitative phosphoproteomics to understand the dynamic
phosphorylation of C. albicans Cdc14 during cell wall stress, cytokinesis/septation, and initiation of hyphal
differentiation. All three aims will conclude with structure-function analyses using biochemical, cell biological,
and waxworm and mouse infection assays to characterize the physiological significance of Cdc14 function and
phosphoregulation, including the importance for pathogenesis. Collectively, the results will define the molecular
mechanisms by which Cdc14 promotes several virulence-related biological processes that will be useful in
assessing its future potential as an antifungal target. The identification of Cdc14 substrates and effectors may
provide additional candidate antifungal targets. The high conservation of Cdc14 structure, activity, and
specificity across the fungal kingdom implies the results will be relevant to many other fungal pathogens."

The mucociliary epithelium plays a key role in both normal and pathological airway biology, as it provides the
first line of defense against inhaled agents. Defects in ciliary beating in multiciliated cells (MCCs) in the airway
contribute to the progression of both genetic and acquired airway diseases.
Here, we will study the molecular mechanisms controlling development and function of MCCs. The motor
proteins that drive ciliary beating are assembled in the cytoplasm, and under the previous version of this
award, we discovered a novel organelle in which these motors are concentrated with various factors that direct
their assembly. The first Aim of this project will explore the hierarchy of interaction among proteins in these
novel organelles; the second will explore the mechanisms by which motors are transported into cilia, and the
third will use large-sale proteomic approaches to identify novel protein-protein interactions important for motor
assembly and function. By rapidly determining the functions of several new protein involved in distinct
processes in MCC development, the Aims in this proposal will provide critical new depth to our understanding
of these essential cell. Moreover, by linking these the disparate processes in MCCs, the experiments here will
add crucial new breadth to our understanding as well.
Impact: Experiments proposed here will lead to a more detailed understanding of the cell biology and genetics
of MCCs and ciliary beating. The results will aid in the development of regenerative therapies aimed at
repairing or restoring damaged tissue and improving mucus clearance in patients with airway disease."
10875294,"Cancer cells are metabolically different from normal matching cells, and this is manifested by the
high rate of glucose metabolism in cancer cells. The high rate of glucose metabolism in cancer
cells is, at least in part, due to the marked induction of hexokinase (HK2) expression, which is
not expressed in most normal cells. Most normal adult tissues and cells express hexokinase 1
(HK1), but when they convert into cancer cells, they start expressing high levels HK2. Thus, HK2
could be a hallmark of cancer cells and could be targeted for cancer therapy. Over the years we
provided genetic proofs of concept that HK2 can be systemically deleted in mice to inhibit cancer
without adverse consequences. We showed that HK2 deficiency inhibited both initiation and
maintenance of cancer in mouse models of lung cancer, breast cancer, liver cancer, and prostate
cancer. Likewise, inducible knockdown of HK2 in human cancer cells inhibited the growth of
tumors after tumor formation. In this grant application we will investigate novel HK2 activities that
were not previously explored. These activities include: (i) A novel moonlighting function of HK2,
independently of its glucose kinase activity. This activity could determine the stability of certain
proteins such as MCL1, NRF2, and SNAIL that are associated with cell survival, redox regulation,
and EMT and metastasis respectively. (ii) A role of HK2 in glycosylation, tumor microenvironment
and immunotherapy. (iii) The effect of HK2 on gene expression through histone lactylation."

exposure, evening exogenous melatonin and chronotherapy to be ineffective/“weak” perhaps due to limited
understanding of DWSPD pathophysiology and compliance. The overall goal of this proposal is to improve our
understanding of DSWPD pathophysiology, which will inform development of new circadian based treatment
strategies to improve the health, performance, and well-being of patients with DSWPD. We will conduct
ambulatory and baseline circadian phase assessments prior to two in-lab circadian protocols to address our
aims: 1) a constant routine protocol to precisely assess the circadian amplitude and phase of central and
peripheral circadian rhythms, and 2) a nighttime light exposure protocol to examine cognitive and physiological
responses. We will also determine if circadian phase can be accurately predicted in patients with DSWPD using
a novel biomarker of circadian phase. Preliminary data from our basic human circadian and clinical trial research
set the stage for this proposal. Our overall goal and aims support the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative, the 2021
National Institutes of Health Sleep Research Plan, and the NHLBI Strategic Vision plan."
10823330,"Studies of somatic mutation have so far focused on cancer or other severe diseases, with little attention
to the basic biology of this important class of variation. As a consequence, the somatic variation catalog
to be produced by the SMaHT network fills an essential need. To build this catalog, novel methods and
approaches are required since current methods cannot comprehensively assess somatic structural
variation (SV) nor transposon activation at scale, or with adequate resolution. We will develop novel
computational methods based on long-read sequencing and will make the methods broadly available
across the SMaHT network. The approaches will leverage new algorithmic and machine learning
approaches, be scalable and provide a reduced error rate, at lower cost. There will be a special focus
on the identification of the movement of transposons across the genome. For this we will implement
better annotation and characterization of insertions and translocations that are evidence for
transposition. In addition, we will identify methylation signals from long-read sequencing data.
Correlation of methylation changes and somatic & mosaic mutations will reveal how these genomic
alterations shape the methylation patterns in critical regions and likely impact genes. To foster the
collaboration with other groups we will closely work together with SMaHT sequencing and analysis
centers. Multiple activities such as the formation of a NIST & SMaHT somatic variation benchmarks, as
well as annual Hackathons, will engage investigators from around the world. The group’s history of
successful methods development will ensure that the SMaHT network will receive useful and
comprehensive new tools to extend the knowledge of somatic and mosaic SVs and transposition."
10848380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Established in 2018, the overarching goal of the University of California – Los Angeles (UCLA) Dental
Specialty PhD Program (DSPP) within the UCLA School of Dentistry (SOD) is to promote the research career
development of highly productive, early-career dentist-scientists and to facilitate their transition to independent
investigators capable of addressing complex challenges within the dental profession and of advancing dental
medicine. The UCLA SOD aspires to transform dental education and research by equipping trainees with
experiences that prepare them to be critical thinkers, effective communicators, and compassionate, skilled
clinicians capable of delivering patient-centered care in a rapidly evolving health care environment. To this end,
the UCLA DSPP successfully recruited and retained two outstanding DSPP Scholars in the prior funding period
who have made notable contributions in research related to oral health, one of which is female. To support the
UCLA DSPP, the UCLA SOD has established outstanding postgraduate dental training programs that include
seven Graduate Medical Education (GME)-supported dental specialty residency programs. The proposed K12
research training includes both PhD research and clinical specialty-oriented research guided by primary
research mentors and clinical specialty mentors, respectively. The DSPP Scholars will complete a 3-year
clinical specialty training block funded by the GME program followed by a 4.5-year PhD training block funded
by the K12 award. Integration of the clinical specialty training and PhD research will be ensured through careful
construction of cohesive mentorship teams, sustained clinical effort during the PhD program, coordinated input
and guidance on selection of the research focus, inclusion of a critical authentic task, continual progress
monitoring, and an established conflict resolution plan. Efforts will be made to achieve diversity of
representation among DSPP Scholars and to recruit candidates from historically marginalized communities,
including candidates from within the UCLA SOD and from the Texas A&M University College of Dentistry. The
UCLA DSPP will provide effective, evidence-based pedagogy, providing all DSPP Scholars an equitable and
inclusive learning experience. Finally, Scholars will enter the transition year supported by UCLA SOD to
conduct postdoctoral research to facilitate their transition to an independent research career. In the current
renewal, the UCLA DSPP seeks to advance ongoing efforts to increase the critical mass of dental school
faculty who contribute to both clinical and scientific excellence, ensure diverse representation among future
dentist-scientists, and construct collaborative networks involving clinician-scientists equipped with unique skills
to address patient-oriented challenges and to transform the future of dentistry."
10769889,"Abstract: The activities of innate and adaptive immune cells need to be precisely coordinated for an effective
immune response to a wide-range of pathogens. There are many similarities between immune responses in
different species, but each species also has adapted to combat unique pathogenic insults. Mechanistically,
structural variation in the genome between species plays a prominent role in the acquisition (or loss) of
regulatory events involved in defining the functional activity of immune cells. Structural variation refers to
genome rearrangements such as translocations, insertions, amplifications, and inversions. Structural variation
in the genome between species has the potential to substantially alter the placement of genes and regulatory
elements, including splitting apart clusters of genes with similar functions, relocating genes to different
chromosomes, and changing the orientation of loci. The functional consequences for changes in the genome
between species are based on how each change affects the regulatory events responsible for controlling gene
expression. Therefore, it is important to define how structural variation between species affects regulatory
principles to improve our ability to relate findings from mechanistic and preclinical studies in model organisms
to the regulation of the human immune response. In this application, we will define how structural variation
between the mouse and human genomes influences the regulatory events involved in controlling genes that
are differentially expressed in mouse and human immune cells. We will determine how structural variation
between the mouse and human genomes affects the 1) topology of the genome, 2) regulatory events that
position topological domain boundaries, 3) enhancer landscape available to genes, and 4) long-range
enhancer-promoter interactions for genes with differences in expression between mouse and human immune
cells. We will test the functional consequences for divergent regulatory events between mouse and human
immune cells, with a focus on defining the regulatory events contributing to differences in the LPS-inducible
expression of Nos2 (encodes inducible nitric oxide synthase; iNOS) in mouse and human macrophages, and
we will use this to build a mouse model reflecting human expression. The mouse is one of the most widely
used preclinical models of the human immune response, and the studies in our proposal will aid in
understanding how structural variation between the genomes of model organisms and the human genome
contribute to species acquiring different cell-type and stimulation-dependent gene expression patterns and
functions. It will also make it possible to predict how mechanisms defined in mice translate to human as well as
build mouse models that better reflect human immune responses for pre-clinical studies."
10875486,"Project Summary
Globally, suboptimal levels of antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence and retention are major causes of
ongoing HIV transmission, treatment failure, illness, and death. To improve ART outcomes, HIV experts agree
that clinical care systems must do two key things: (1) Find nonadherence (identify nonadherent people living
with HIV (PLWH) as early as possible); and (2) Support good adherence (implement effective interventions to
promote better ART retention and adherence). The SUSTAIN study will pursue both objectives by determining
the optimal combination of five evidence-based early nonadherence detection and adherence support compo-
nents in local clinics in Cape Town, South Africa. Of these five components, three focus on finding non-
adherence: (1) immediate outreach to the patient when standard testing shows unsuppressed virus; (2)
pharmacy refill monitoring (PRM) and follow-up; and (3) real-time electronic adherence monitoring (EAM). Two
components focus on supporting good adherence by strengthening existing patient support in Cape Town: (4)
applying enhanced peer group support using motivational interviewing techniques and (5) weekly check-in
texts. Each component is feasible, acceptable, and effective for monitoring or supporting adherence in PLWH
in Cape Town or a similar low-resource setting. As informed by Self-Determination Theory, each addresses
behavioral mediators that can increase motivation and competence and improve ART adherence and
retention. To identify the best combination of components, we will utilize an innovative and practical application
of Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST), an engineering-inspired approach that is uniquely suited to the
testing of separate intervention components and their interactions in combinations to “optimize” a potent multi-
component intervention. Guided by MOST, we propose three specific aims: (1) employ an efficient fractional
factorial design to determine the effects of five intervention elements on HIV viral suppression, as well as
secondary outcomes; (2) evaluate intervention components to address implementation, service, and client
outcomes according to the Proctor framework; and (3) use the effectiveness, cost, and implementation data
from Aims 1 and 2 to model the multi-component intervention optimized for cost-effectiveness and implement-
ation success. SUSTAIN addresses a crucial NIH priority—strengthening care for PLWH at high risk of
treatment failure. It will also be among the first studies to use MOST to improve the HIV care continuum in a
resource-constrained setting. The study’s combination of different methods of finding nonadherence and
supporting good adherence has high potential to identify cost-effective and scaleable evidence-based inter-
ventions and improve HIV treatment outcomes. Inclusion of both real-time electronic monitoring and pharmacy
refill monitoring as intervention components will increase understanding of the best uses of technology to
support adherence. Importantly, our approach can be used as a template for other settings to identify and
implement the most appropriate and effective evidence-based interventions for broad, cost-effective impact."
10854863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) affects more than 65,000 women in the United States annually and
includes life-threatening conditions that can occur during delivery and the postpartum period. Racial and ethnic
disparities in SMM at delivery are well-documented and accruing evidence shows that these disparities persist
into the postpartum period. Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women have 2 to 3 times the rate of postpartum
hypertensive complications compared to White women and accordingly disparities with regards to
cardiovascular-related events, which account for half of all postpartum SMM, are most striking. These health
disparities are driven by a complex system of individual, interpersonal, and structural factors. In 2020, Boston
Medical Center, the largest safety-net hospital in New England, implemented a remote blood pressure monitoring
program in which women who are at elevated risk for hypertension are sent home with a cloud-connected blood
pressure cuff postpartum for six weeks of daily monitoring. This project will evaluate whether the newly
implemented program reduces the incidence of postpartum SMM in the year after delivery among non-Hispanic
Black and Hispanic women. We hypothesize that this reduction will operate through mechanisms of fewer
unscheduled healthcare visits, including both triage/emergency care as well as hospital readmissions, and
improved self-management. Our proposal will focus specifically on high-risk, non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic
women to conduct the following specific aims (1) examine the impact of the remote blood pressure monitoring
program on healthcare utilization, including unscheduled and scheduled visits through 6 weeks and 12 months
postpartum; (2) collect qualitative data on the acceptability of the remote blood pressure monitoring and self-
management of hypertension among 50 patients (25 Black and 25 Hispanic) and 10 providers through semi-
structured interviews; and (3) develop a complex systems science model of postpartum SMM, accounting for
relationships within and between factors at the individual, interpersonal and structural level informed by empirical
data on approximately 38,000 deliveries at Boston Medical Center (2004-2019), and use that model to simulate
the impact of the remote blood pressure monitoring program on postpartum SMM. The ultimate goal of this
research is to harness existing data resources, elicit qualitative patient feedback, and utilize advanced
computational methods to assess the acceptability and impact of an existing blood pressure monitoring program
in reducing postpartum SMM among high-risk women of color. This approach will provide critical evidence
regarding the feasibility of a remote postpartum blood pressure monitoring program as a means to reducing
disparities in SMM."

 Over 55 million people live with dementia worldwide, and this number is expected to reach 78 million by
2030, according to the projection by the World Health Organization. The main cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s
disease (AD), whose distinguishing molecular feature is the presence of amyloid b (Ab) plaques, and abnormally
phosphorylated tau in brain. Aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are seen in
AD and about 20 other neurodegenerative disorders collectively known as tauopathies. It is noteworthy that
except AD, tauopathies do not have significant Ab accumulation, suggesting a key causal role of tau in
neurodegeneration. This notion has been supported by many studies based on mouse models. However, the
exact nature of tau pathogenesis remains elusive, therefore hampering effective drug development. To dissect
the mechanistic details of hyperphosphorylated tau-mediated neurodegeneration, and to take advantage of the
advanced genetic tools offered by the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, we have established a novel in cibo (in
food) model of Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathies. This model gives us the ability to induce the disease in
adult flies, and precisely define the form of p-tau/tau that the organism is exposed to, both of which are not
possible using a transgenic fly model. By feeding adult Drosophila with hyperphosphorylated tau, we have
recapitulated critical neurological features of AD in flies, including the late onset and age-dependent
neurodegeneration, disintegrated blood brain barrier, and conspicuous pathology in different areas of the brain.
These pathological traits become evident in less than four weeks after the treatment, therefore providing a
significant advantage over other animal models that take months to develop neurological pathology.
 The overarching goal of our research is to use this novel fly model to help develop efficacious means for
AD therapy and prevention. To this end, we will use this exploratory R21 project to characterize the disease state
of this model and lay the foundation for future comprehensive mechanistic studies to understand gut-brain
signaling in neurodegenerative diseases, and drug discovery projects. We will use a variety of approaches to
understand the molecular basis for hyperphosphorylated tau-inflicted pathology, and examine the interplay
between p-tau and known and suspected AD contributors such as Ab, apolipoprotein E (APOE), and a-synuclein."
10852925,"Scientific workforce diversity has been a longstanding challenge, and lack of progress negatively impacts
innovation, scientific discovery, and ultimately public health. Despite ongoing efforts, racial diversity among the
nation’s scientific research faculty remains low. Vanderbilt is well poised to build on this experience and achieve
more racial and ethnic diversity
among our scientific research faculty. The Vanderbilt Faculty Institutional
Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation Program (V-FIRST) will leverage substantial new institutional
commitments to diversity and inclusion, and will build on prior success, recruiting women faculty and Black and
Latinx postdoctoral fellows, to optimize recruitment and retention of Black, Latinx, American Indian, and Pacific
Islander faculty. With commitment of a 3:1 match of institutional dollars to NIH FIRST dollars, V-FIRST will
recruit at least 18 tenure-track faculty from minoritized racial and ethnic groups. With a leadership team
comprised of key institutional leaders who are highly committed to and experienced in recruiting, developing,
mentoring and sponsoring faculty from minoritized groups, we will achieve these goals:
Overall Aim 1: Identify and eliminate organizational barriers that impede full participation, advancement,
and thriving of racially diverse faculty in academia. We will implement sustainable and progressive
institutional policies that enhance diverse faculty hiring, retention, promotion, and tenure, and employ cross-
institutional strategies to cultivate inclusivity, cohesion, and belonging.
Overall Aim 2: In a series of three cluster hires, recruit 18-20 tenure-track, early-career scientific faculty
who are Black, Latinx, American Indian, and Pacific Islander, and establish a supportive and nurturing
environment for their success. Using an equity framework, we will implement an inclusive search process that
proactively identifies early career Black, Latinx, American Indian, and Pacific Islander scientists, equitably
evaluates applications, removes barriers to applying, and provides well-resourced start-up packages.
Overall Aim 3: Effectively mentor, retain, and support diverse early-career scientific faculty to promotion
with tenure. In addition to Vanderbilt’s vast faculty development resources, we will provide V-FIRST faculty with
a multi-tier mentoring and nationally recognized senior scientists as sponsors. We will reduce isolation and
increase sense of community with social and culturally-relevant activities that enable V-FIRST faculty to thrive.
Overall Aim 4: Comprehensively evaluate V-FIRST’s hiring process, career development activities and
the impact of V-FIRST on Vanderbilt’s culture. Using an equity lens, we will determine the effectiveness of
the V-FIRST program through process and outcome indicators that measure change at multiple levels, including
faculty development, mentoring and relationships, and institutional policies, practices, and culture. We will use
data collected through evaluation to inform ongoing program improvement and institutional change."
10852926,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Addressing the longstanding lack of diversity among scientific faculty requires sustainable systemic and
institutional change. The Administrative Core of the Vanderbilt Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable
Transformation Program (V-FIRST) will: 1) provide the organizational structure for the cluster hiring of 18-20
tenure-track, early-career scientific faculty who are Black, Latinx, American Indian, and Pacific Islander; 2) serve
as V-FIRST's operational home – manage fiscal activities, support cross-core initiatives, and effectively
communicate with internal and external stakeholders; and 3) facilitate the transfer of knowledge and lessons
learned into institution-wide changes in policies and practices. These activities will be vital to V-FIRST's
overarching goal – transforming Vanderbilt into an institution with a thriving, racially diverse scientific faculty,
and a sustainable institutional culture of inclusive excellence.
The Administrative Core will leverage institutional expertise in building diverse collaborative teams; recruiting
and retaining scientific faculty from minoritized racial and ethnic groups; developing successful diversity, equity
and inclusion initiatives and change management experience. Grounded in principles of equity, transparent
communication, institutional accountability, efficient use of financial and human resources, and a commitment to
data-driven approaches, the Administrative Core will accomplish the following:
Administrative Aim 1: Implement a highly efficient organizational structure that serves as V-FIRST's
operational home and enables V-FIRST to transform Vanderbilt into an institution with a thriving, racially
diverse scientific faculty, and a sustainable institutional culture of inclusive excellence. The
Administrative Core will establish the governance, secure technical and human resources needed to operate V-
FIRST, manage fiscal resources, support cross-core integration, and effectively communicate with stakeholders.
Administrative Aim 2: Recruit, hire and retain a racially diverse cohort of early career, tenure track
scientific faculty and provide tools, resources, and support to facilitate scientific productivity and
achieve promotion. To hire 18-20 tenure-track, early-career scientific faculty who are Black, Latinx, American
Indian, and Pacific Islander, the Administrative Core will implement three rounds of cluster hiring using innovative
search and recruitment strategies and will facilitate the appointment of faculty with equitable startup packages.
Administrative Aim 3: Use evidence generated by V-FIRST and the broader FIRST Consortium to
facilitate institution-wide changes in policies and practices to foster sustainable culture change and
inclusive excellence. The Administrative Core will facilitate the transfer of knowledge and lessons learned into
new policies and practices that support inclusive hiring, equitable promotion, and a culture and climate of
belonging. Administrative Core leaders will proactively promote buy-in and accountability for V-FIRST goals
among institutional leaders across Vanderbilt."
10852928,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to recruit and retain a racially diverse faculty workforce with a commitment to
diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), to reduce isolation through innovative social support and mentoring, and
to sustain inclusive excellence by preparing faculty members for leadership positions. Vanderbilt has
demonstrated its commitment to diverse leadership by hiring women into key administrative roles. However,
the hiring of diverse faculty by race and socioeconomic status has not kept pace. Through innovative
recruitment programs and professional relationships, Vanderbilt completed a 10-faculty cluster hire of racially
diverse early career scientists. Their individual research focus synergistically aligns with each other and
amongst the four Thematic Cores. To further support faculty diversity, Vanderbilt commits 3 institutional dollars
for each NIH FIRST dollar, facilitating the hire of at least 18 Vanderbilt FIRST (V-FIRST) faculty members.
Critical factors, such as support of senior faculty mentors, peer networking, professional skill development, and
a better understanding of institutional culture significantly enhances transition to promotion with tenure. In
addition, emphasizing leadership increases faculty retention and enables early career faculty (ECF) to become
administrative agents for sustainable cultural change. This proposal will demonstrate that deliberate career
advancement and community building opportunities within an academically rich collaborative environment will
lead to V-FIRST faculty promotion and retention. Furthermore, development of V-FIRST leadership skills will
optimize their transition into Vanderbilt administration, a key institutional sustainability element.
Aim 1. Ensure scholarly and professional career development in a robust intellectual community. The
Faculty Development Core (FDC) Leadership Team will ensure our V-FIRST recruits receive training in all
aspects of career development in a stage-appropriate manner. We will enhance V-FIRST mentoring through a
complementary cadre of diverse, nationally recognized senior scientists, as well as mid-career Vanderbilt
faculty members with a strong commitment to DEI. Aim 2. Create an environment of inclusive excellence
to reduce isolation and build community. The mentors and FDC Leadership Team will identify collaborative
and career advancement opportunities, as well as participate in common social interest activities. We will also
expand “safe spaces”, such as the Vanderbilt Breakfast Club, a monthly works-in-progress meeting led by UR
senior faculty and initiate a Senior UR Faculty Lecture Series (My Journey), to enhance scholastic productivity
and reduce isolation. Aim 3. Contribute to a sustainable inclusive community by preparing V-FIRST
faculty for leadership. Sustained institutional inclusive excellence requires leaders with clear DEI
commitment. We have created a personalized leadership program that will lay the foundation for V-FIRST
members to become institutional leaders. V-FIRST ECF will receive external coaching and will participate in
Executive Leadership Institute training through the Owen Graduate School of Management."
10852932,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: EVALUATION CORE
The Vanderbilt FIRST (V-FIRST) Evaluation Core (EC) will be grounded in equity-focused, theory-driven
evaluation to ensure that planning, monitoring, evaluation, and tracking of V-FIRST are comprehensive to the
needs and goals of V-FIRST, and will employ evaluation activities to ensure that the EC is contributing to the
goals of the FIRST program more broadly. The EC will test the hypothesis that 1) hiring a cohort of diverse
faculty, 2) investing in the career development of those faculty with resources and relationships (mentoring and
sponsorship), and 3) implementing institutional level practices to create academic cultures of inclusive
excellence will lead to significant improvements in metrics of institutional culture and workforce diversity.
Specifically, we will use quantitative and qualitative data collection methods to assess the following: Hiring:
Increased percentage of Black, Latinx, American Indian, and Pacific Islander scientists applying to and
accepting faculty positions; Racial diversity of faculty mirrors racial diversity of US population; Salary and start-
up packages for faculty from minoritized racial groups are equal to other faculty in the same discipline, school,
and rank; Faculty development: Faculty report satisfaction with lab, ability to recognize and access resources
to advance their careers, and growth in skills overtime; Faculty meet milestones in faculty development plan;
Number and impact of published papers; Number and type of grants applied for and won; Awards received for
scholarship (research, leadership, service), and faculty achieve promotion & tenure. Mentoring and
relationships: Faculty report satisfaction with their mentoring teams, Sponsors, relationships with other faculty
at Vanderbilt, and opportunities for collaboration; Faculty report increased sense of belonging over time; Social
network studies demonstrate increased scholarly integration V-FIRST faculty with their thematic areas over
time; V-FIRST faculty report they are supported and recognized for their accomplishments by their peers,
mentors, and institution; V-FIRST mentors report cultural humility, confidence in mentoring faculty from
minoritized groups, and receiving support and resources they need to be good mentors. Institutional-level
change: Implementation of new and/or changed policies and practices to enhance equity; Growth of social
network ties across race, gender, and disciplinary diversity; Increased percentage of faculty participating in DEI
trainings and reporting implementation of training content; Vanderbilt leadership displays race, gender, and
other forms of diversity in leadership positions beyond DEI; Parity among faculty from various demographic
groups on all domains of institutional surveys. We aim to build stakeholder voice throughout our evaluation
process, such that V-FIRST faculty have multiple and confidential outlets for providing feedback, but are
sheltered from the burden of trying to affect those changes. We will build on Vanderbilt's established Flight
Tracker tool, a career development data and reporting dashboard to collect, store, manage, and share V-
FIRST evaluation data. We will cooperate fully with the FIRST CEC, housed at Morehouse School of Medicine."
10854938,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is a potentially life-threatening pediatric autoimmune disease that frequently
first presents with cutaneous inflammation and can progress to debilitating muscle weakness, calcinosis, and
severe lung disease. Two-thirds of children do not respond to initial treatment, and there is a lack of prognostic
biomarkers and targeted treatments. Thus, there is a critical need to develop a better understanding of cellular
disease mechanisms and molecular heterogeneity to advance precision medicine. Deeper investigation of
molecular disease signatures at the tissue level, where active inflammation frequently persists, holds the
potential to delineate novel disease mechanisms, biomarkers and treatment targets. The specific scientific aims
of this project are to 1) Utilize cutaneous and peripheral blood gene expression signatures to determine biology
and predictors of JDM treatment response and 2) Determine single-cell and spatial transcriptional phenotypes
of myeloid cells within skin and blood that are associated with treatment refractory JDM. Through a longitudinal
approach and non-invasive skin sampling methodology in a well-phenotyped JDM cohort, the candidate will
characterize cutaneous transcriptomic signatures in both lesional and non-lesional skin as related to treatment
response. The candidate will leverage paired blood samples to directly compare the importance of tissue-specific
signatures in biomarker development. Cutaneous myeloid cell populations in treatment refractory JDM patients
will additionally be assessed at a single-cell level with spatial resolution to better understand the potential role of
myeloid cells as mediators of cutaneous inflammation and dermal-systemic immune crosstalk. The applicant is
an Assistant Professor and Pediatric Rheumatologist at the University of Michigan and actively treats children
with JDM. Her long-term career goal is to advance knowledge of disease mechanisms, identify novel biomarkers
and discover therapeutic targets in JDM in order to improve care for her patients. To become an independent
physician scientist with expertise in molecular and cellular mechanisms of pediatric autoimmune disease, the
candidate will accomplish the following scientific training goals: 1) gain expertise in working with additional patient
biosamples and primary cells, specifically using keratinocytes and myeloid cells, as a model to study immune
dysregulation in JDM, 2) develop skills in the application of bioinformatic, single-cell and systems biology
approaches to the study of pediatric autoimmune disease, and 3) gain expertise in study design, integration and
analysis of molecular and clinical patient-oriented data. The candidate will also complete the following career
development goals: 1) develop skills to lead a translational research team and mentor trainees, 2) improve written
and oral communication skills and 3) establish a multicenter research network. The applicant has formed an
engaged team of mentors and advisors with expertise in keratinocyte biology, immunology, bioinformatics,
single-cell methods and systems biology approaches to integration of patient-oriented data to guide her in the
proposed study and career development goals."
10857169,"ABSTRACT
The NIH has a strong commitment to advancing diversity in the biomedical workforce but has recognized that
NIH-funded institutions may lack the organizational culture required to foster and develop diverse scientists. The
NIH Faculty Institutional Recruitment for Sustainable Transformation [FIRST] Program will provide a major
investment toward transforming institutional culture by integrating a cohort model of faculty hires committed
to diversity and inclusive excellence. The University of Texas at El Paso [UTEP] proposes the UTEP FIRST
program as a framework to address the shortage of diverse research scientists who focus on Hispanic Health
Disparities [HHD]. UTEP is a Minority/Hispanic-Serving Institution that is a focal point for education and
biomedical research for people living on the United States-Mexico border. The cornerstone is the
operationalization of strategic Diversity, Equity and Inclusion [DEI] initiatives that will provide an integrative
theme for addressing the FIRST Program goals of: (1) fostering sustainable institutional culture change; (2)
promoting institutional inclusive excellence by hiring a diverse cohort of new faculty; and (3) supporting faculty
development, mentoring, sponsorship, and promotion. The overarching goal of the UTEP FIRST proposal is to
drive significant change in the institutional culture at UTEP, thereby uplifting early-career faculty on their
trajectory toward academic and research success. The vision is to be a national leader in diversifying the
biomedical research workforce and a national resource for studying and implementing systemic change that
support academic cultures of inclusive excellence. We will test the hypothesis that a cohort model of faculty
hiring, sponsorship, continual mentoring, and professional development through evidence-based practices for
fostering academic cultures of inclusive excellence will achieve significant improvements in metrics of
institutional culture and scientific discovery. The FIRST cohort will involve a total of six faculty hires with research
interests in minority health disparities. Three Specific Aims are integrated across three cores. The aim of the
Administrative Core is to create transformative cultural and institutional changes through the framework of
Inclusive Excellence, leading to supportive and inclusive environments that develop diverse faculty who excel in
discipline-specific and interdisciplinary research focused on reducing HHD. The aim of the Faculty Development
Core is to develop, implement and sustain a UTEP FIRST program that builds communities of practice and
integrates innovative infrastructures, leading to transformative and sustainable changes in policies, procedures,
and processes that foster the retention, progression, and promotion of diverse faculty. The aim of the Evaluation
Core is to foster and institutionalize program improvement and sustainability by testing the primary hypothesis
through documentation of faculty, department, and institutional level metrics and indicators. Expected findings
will exert a powerful influence by fostering a sustainable institutional culture change, thereby providing UTEP
with the foundation needed for thriving at the intersectionality of research, culture, diversity, and inclusion."
10857170,"The overarching goal of the proposed UTEP FIRST Administrative Core is to achieve significant systemic and
sustainable institutional culture change that support development and retention of faculty who have an inclusive-
excellence mindset and who excel in research focused on reducing Hispanic Health Disparities [HHD]. To reach
its goals, the AC will involve stakeholders across the university in its strategic actions and development of
policies, procedures, and processes. In addition, the AC will work closely with the Faculty Development Core
and coordinate with the Evaluation Core to assess the impact and make improvements throughout the course of
the grant. The Specific Aims enumerated below align with the Inclusive Excellence framing adopted by the
university. Aim 1: Cultivate institutional structures that ensure HHD researchers flourish and excel. The
proposed activities will invest in the infrastructure and resources needed to support the growth of HHD
bureaucratic structures that provide equitable and inclusive policies, procedures, practices, and processes. Aim
2: Examine and improve behaviors across the university and units that contribute to the growth of HHD
researchers and make excellence inclusive. The proposed activities will establish best practices for faculty
searches and hiring that use an Inclusive Excellence approach, deliver professional development workshops
that reinforce Inclusive Excellence practices inside and outside the classroom, and create programming that
prepares and empowers future leaders who champion Inclusive Excellence. Aim 3: Establish knowledge-
informed processes to continuously improve inclusive excellence focused on the progression of FIRST
cohort faculty and other HHD investigators. The activities will include conducting the AAAS STEMM Equity
Achievement [SEA] Change self-assessment to establish DEI action plans and create a data dashboard that
includes access to research-based studies that inform decision-making. The AC expected outcomes are:
successful hires of a six-researcher cohort that is composed of highly qualified faculty in HHD research and
committed to Inclusive Excellence; the FIRST faculty cohort receive constructive feedback during performance
evaluation and are involved in multi-level mentoring that supports their progression toward T&P; professional
development workshops are effective based on Inclusive Excellence indicators; institutional policies and
procedures aligned with Inclusive Excellence are institutionalized; and FIRST faculty move from early-stage
investigators to established principal investigators to emergent leaders."
10663795,"Background: Depression is the most prevalent mental health disorder in VHA and is strongly
associated with disability and suicide mortality, especially when untreated. Understanding the
profiles of patients that disengage from care will help develop support systems to improve care
utilization and outcomes. According to Levesque’s framework, relevant patient characteristics that
lead to care access map onto a process that incorporates identifying health care needs and desire
for care, healthcare seeking, reaching, and utilization, all leading to health care outcomes. Using this
framework, the proposed CDA takes a two-prong approach in response to underutilization of care
among those with depression by: developing risk predictive models through analytics methodology
and leveraging the role of mood and symptom self-monitoring as key components in depression
management. Significance/Impact: The knowledge developed through this CDA has long term
implications for OEF/OIF Veterans who are at highest risk for depression and suicide. Depression
has a significant impact on Veterans, providers, and the VA. It is a disorder that is linked to
substantial medical and economic burden in the VA. Depression is a risk factor for the development
and maintenance of medical and psychiatric conditions (i.e., PTSD, TBI). Despite persistent efforts
to increase care for depression, treatment guidelines are exclusively focused on those engaging in
care. Pre-treatment interventions have the potential to increase mental health care utilization and
reduce depression related burden on patients and the VA. Such interventions can minimize provider
burden by reducing no shows and by increasing adherence. Innovation: Research shows that the
VA has the potential to foster the development of tools to enhance mental health care for Veterans.
To fill gaps in the use of analytics and technology in enhancing care for mental health concerns, the
proposed work is innovative in two ways: 1) we propose the use of big data and analytics tools to
identify patient profiles associated with mental health treatment engagement and increased risk for
drop out of care; 2) develop a technology driven intervention to increase self-efficacy and active
engagement in mental health care. Specific Aims: RA1: Identify risk profiles (scores) associated
with depression treatment use. Test prediction models using VHA electronic health records (EHR).
Risk scores computed in Aim 1 will be used in selection of patients at risk and eligible for the
proposed intervention.TA1: Gain proficiency in methods and analysis of EHR/big data. RA2: Design
an eHealth intervention using technology driven self-monitoring. TA2: Develop skills and knowledge
about intervention development. RA3: Formatively evaluate and pilot the eHealth intervention. TA3:

Leveraging the strengths of EHR data and analytics tools, we will investigate risk models to identify
patient profiles associated with treatment initiation and adherence. Predictors will be extracted from
structured data. RA2 is a development aim. We propose to design and formatively develop an
eHealth intervention primarily using technology driven self-monitoring of depressed mood and
symptoms. RA3 is a formative evaluation and pilot aim focused on the use of the intervention among
OEF/OIF Veterans with probable depression (N= 15). Next Steps/Implementation: This CDA will
help to establish a foundation for future efficacy/effectiveness research on interventions to increase
treatment utilization among Veterans with depression. Results will be used to inform the submission
of a RCT IIR in year 3 of the CDA to evaluate the efficacy/effectiveness of this intervention. Tools
developed in this CDA will contribute to VA innovation goals."
10867308,"Project Summary/Abstract: We propose to conduct a first-in-human clinical trial of BDNF
gene therapy in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), aiming to
reduce neuronal loss and to activate neuronal function. BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
Factor) is actively produced and utilized in cortical circuits throughout life to sustain neuronal
function and circuits. In animal models of AD, BDNF builds new synapses, prevents neuronal
death and activates neurons; thus, BDNF offers the potential to slow or actually reverse
cognitive decline in established AD and MCI. Proof-of-concept studies have been performed in
mice, rats and rhesus monkeys.
Because BDNF is a relatively large and polar protein that does not cross the blood brain barrier,
we will use intraparenchymal gene therapy to deliver BDNF directly into the entorhinal cortex.
BDNF will be neuronally trafficked into the hippocampus. BDNF will be delivered using adeno-
associated serotype 2 vectors (AAV2), which have now been utilized in hundreds of patients in
CNS gene therapy trials. We will utilize start-of-the-art methods for gene delivery, employing
real-time MR guidance and convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in collaboration with the world
leaders in this technology at Ohio State University (OSU).
A total of 12 patients (6 AD and 6 MCI) will be recruited from two clinical sites: UCSD and Case
Western. All patients will undergo gene delivery at OSU. The primary outcome measure will be
safety, together with secondary cognitive outcome measures that reflect memory-specific and
global cognitive measures. Serum, CSF and imaging biomarkers will be collected. If AAV2-
BDNF gene delivery is safe and well-tolerated, and exhibit possible cognitive benefits, we will
advance to Phase 2 trials. An IND for this program is under review by the FDA, and the trial will
begin upon FDA clearance. Two dose groups will be studied: 3x1011 vg/ml and 1x1012 vg/ml.
Relevance: Effective disease-modifying therapies for AD and MCI have not been identified.
BDNF gene delivery offers the potential to slow or reverse cognitive decline in established AD
by building new synapses, stimulating neuronal function and reducing neuronal death. Our
approach also offers the potential for combination therapy with amyloid- and tau-modifying
therapies."
10892047,"Project Summary
A balanced supply of deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), the building blocks for DNA, is vital for the
synthesis or repair of both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, whereas its imbalance results in genome
instability that precipitates cellular damage and breach of homeostasis. Research on dNTP metabolism has
been traditionally conducted in highly proliferative (e.g. tumor cells), metabolically active (e.g. muscle cells) or
virus-infected cells due to the key roles of dNTPs in fulfilling demands for cell growth, energy production and
viral replication. However, little is known regarding the role of dNTP metabolism in innate immunity, especially
in the context of nonpathogen-induced immune activation. A hallmark of innate immune activation is the
assembly of the Nod-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome—a dominant innate
immune sensor for tissue damage. The NLRP3 inflammasome is composed of the sensor NLRP3, the adaptor
ASC (apoptosis associated spike-like protein) and the effector pro-caspase-1. Assembly of the NLRP3
inflammasome proceeds with two distinct steps: ‘priming’ and ‘activation’. Priming entails rapid NF-kB
activation for initiating de novo synthesis of pro-IL-1β as well as increasing the amount of NLRP3. In contrast,
activation involves the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome machinery, resulting in autocleavage and
activation of caspase-1 which then converts immature pro-IL-1β into bioactive IL-1β—a powerful
proinflammatory cytokine that ignites inflammation. Although properly controlled NLRP3 inflammasome activity
allows for restoration of homeostasis after traumatic tissue injury by stimulating damage clearance and tissue
repair, its aberrant and prolonged activation also promotes the rapid progression of many devastating
disorders, including gouty arthritis, Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, macular degeneration and cancer. It
is therefore crucial to understand how NLRP3 inflammasome activity is regulated in innate immune cells.
Recently, we discovered that genetic deletion of CMPK2 or SAMHD1, two key enzymes within the dNTP
metabolic pathways responsible for synthesizing or degrading dNTPs respectively, orchestrates NLRP3
inflammasome activation. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this MIRA R35 project is to establish dNTP
metabolism as a new layer for innate immune regulation and further delineate its underlying mechanism of
action. To achieve this goal, three major scientific questions will be pursued: (1) how does inflammasome
priming regulate the function of dNTP metabolic enzymes? (2) how does dNTP metabolism control NLRP3
inflammasome activation? Lastly, since NLRP3 inflammasome overactivation is a shared pathogenic hallmark
of many diseases, we further asked: (3) do common disease risk factors, such as aging and obesity,
dysregulate macrophage dNTP metabolism, thereby permitting NLRP3 inflammasome overactivation?
Completion of this project will not only fill an important knowledge gap in the innate immunity field, but may
also guide new therapy development to prevent NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation."

 4 expertise in translational science; 3) acquire skills in quantitative analysis, including social network analysis; and
 5 4) enhance my ability to write competitive grant applications and increase my scholarly productivity. With my
 6 primary mentor, Dr. Marian Fitzgibbon, I have assembled a strong team of co-mentors and advisors (including a
7 biostatistician) to guide me through the proposed training and research activities. The proposed career
 8 development plan is structured to ensure that I achieve training milestones through didactic coursework, career
 9 development workshops, and attendance at national scientific meetings. The University of Illinois at Chicago
10 (School of Public Health and Cancer Center) are committed to supporting my career development and providing
11 the protected time needed to achieve my career and research goals. The overall objective of this K01 research
12 project is to test the effectiveness of a culturally targeted video, previously developed by our research team, on
13 promoting genetic counseling attendance among African American (AA) women determined to be at high risk for
14 breast cancer through cancer genetic risk assessment at a Federally Qualified Health Center. Uptake of genetic
15 services is particularly low among high-risk AA women, who carry a disproportionate burden of breast cancer
16 mortality. Further, although testing close relatives of individuals who test positive for a pathogenic variant might
17 curtail breast cancer disparities attributable to hereditary risk, it is unclear how counseled or tested individuals
18 influence their social and familial networks. Thus, my central hypothesis is that the culturally targeted video will
19 increase genetic counseling attendance among participants compared to those who receive a genetic counseling
20 brochure. The proposed Specific Aims are to: 1) compare the effects of the video and brochure on genetic
21 counseling attendance among AA women at high risk for breast cancer; 2) test how psychosocial factors
22 (knowledge, intrinsic motivation, risk perception, distress) affect relationships between intervention exposures
23 (video/brochure) and genetic counseling attendance; and 3) compare the impact of intervention exposures
24 (video/brochure) on diffusion of knowledge through social network analysis. My prior training, coupled with the
25 skills that I will acquire during the award period, will equip me to successfully conduct the proposed research
26 and position me to continue my work to address breast cancer disparities that persist among high-risk AA women.

10832627,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Bacteria, such as those found in the vertebrate gut microbiome, have been shown to have widespread
effects on both the enteric (ENS) and central nervous systems (CNS) in numerous animals. Reciprocally, the
ENS has been shown to have an impact on the progression of microbiome establishment in the gut. However,
despite the profound influence of bacteria on neuronal development and physiology, the diversity of the
vertebrate gut microbiome and the complexity of the ENS make the mechanisms underlying these phenomena
difficult to study. Despite the importance of the topic and vertebrate models, these systems involve
microbiomes that are both spatially and compositionally complex, often with thousands of bacterial species that
can very between individual hosts. Therefore there is a role for simple, exquisitely manipulable model systems
in which to study the effects of bacterial symbionts on neuronal development and function. To address the
dearth of such models for the mechanisms by which bacteria influence host neurobiology, we propose to use
the symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) and its luminescent bacterial symbiont
Vibrio fischeri as a tractable system in which to study how bacteria drive host neuronal development. The
squid-vibrio system is a well-established model for the effects of bacterial products on host physiology and
development, with outcomes that are often generalizable to other animal systems. This proposal aims to
develop the squid-vibrio system into a new model for the study of the effects of microbes on host neurobiology.
In our first aim we will define the neuronal landscape of the light organ, including neuronal position and identity
and the effect of symbiosis and bacterial products on both. To achieve this aim, we will develop new methods
for dual labeling of RNA and proteins in our system and adapt neuronal tracing techniques for imaging in the
light organ. In our second aim we propose to study the role of neuropeptide signaling on transducing microbial
signals from V. fischeri to tissues on the outside of the symbiotic organ. Specifically, we will determine the
location and dynamics of FMRFamide signaling in the light organ over the first three days of symbiosis and will
examine the effects of FMRFamide signaling on bacterially-mediated post-embryonic development. The data
arising from this proposal will not only lay the foundation for a powerful new model system, but will also
generate new resources and techniques for the community and provide new insights as to the role of the
peripheral nervous system in potentiating microbially-mediated development."

Transfer RNAs (tRNA) represent one of the most abundant forms of RNA and are required for protein synthesis.
Chemically modified ribonucleosides in tRNAs play critical roles in aspects that range from decoding codons to
stress tolerance. Limited studies for metazoans, specifically in blood feeding arthropods, have been conducted
on tRNAs and their modifications. The goal of these studies is to provide a characterization of the tRNA pool and
modifications in blood feeding insects. These changes will be examined during blood feeding, reproduction, and
mating at the whole organism and tissue levels. Our studies are supported by the following: 1) preliminary results
from limited samples, which identified and quantified tRNA modifications, that suggest there are differences
between blood feeding and sexes; and 2) Re-analysis of previously published data sets indicate expression
patterns of genes associated with tRNA modification vary following a blood meal and between sexes.
This study has two specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Characterize transfer RNA modifications in insects between sexes and during blood feeding.
Specific Aim 2. Investigate the role of transfer RNA modifications during blood feeding and reproduction.
Upon completion of this proposed research, we will establish tRNA expression and modification profiles for
multiple blood feeding species in relation to reproduction and blood feeding. The role of several modifications
will be elucidated by the use of targeted reduction of specific tRNA modifying enzymes. These proposed studies
will be the first to extensively examine tRNA expression and modification patterns in blood feeding insects. Our
results will provide the groundwork for future, novel tRNA-based studies of blood feeding insects such as
identifying tRNA modifications critical to vector survival as climate change progresses and the dynamics between
tRNA expression and modifications during pathogen transmission."
10894281,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a life-
threatening disease that develops because of viral/bacterial infections (e.g. COVID-19), trauma, sepsis,
pneumonia, or transfusion. ALI/ARDS remains a significant health burden in the United States with a high
incidence and mortality rate (30-40%). Past interventional studies have mainly centered around early-stage
supportive care such as ventilation which has limited utility. Despite several investigations, no effective
pharmacological therapy exists for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. Mechanistically, ALI/ARDS is caused by the long-
lasting activation of macrophages and infiltration of neutrophils due to their phenotypic shift towards the pro-
inflammatory status. In the absence of ALI, alveolar macrophages (AMɸ) exist primarily in the anti-inflammatory
phenotype, assisting in constructive processes. Upon sensing pathogens, AMɸ takes on an pro-inflammatory
phenotype that secretes high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines which can lead to an uncontrolled cytokine
storm. We hypothesize that the acute pulmonary inflammation can be resolved by reprogramming macrophages
by novel pharmacotherapies for effective treatment of ALI. Driven by this hypothesis, the goal of this project is
to engineer an innovative macrophage-based pharmacotherapy (MEAT) for targeted immunomodulation in ALI.
MEAT integrates macrophages’ inflammation targeting and therapeutic capabilities for ALI immune environment
modulation. MEAT is composed of macrophages coated with a biomaterial that carries a pair of synergistic
cytokines which can exert potent effects in programing macrophages and neutrophils to the anti-inflammatory
phenotype. Two independent specific aims have been planned. In Aim 1, we will develop, optimize, and
characterize MEAT capable of programming macrophages and neutrophils toward anti-inflammatory phenotypes
in vitro. In this aim, we will determine the concentration-, ratio-, and temporal-requirements for optimal
combination of IL-4 and IL-10 to program macrophages and neutrophils. We will then assemble and optimize
MEAT to recapitulate these requirements for optimal macrophage and neutrophil modulation in vitro. In Aim 2,
we will evaluate the efficacy of MEAT in resolving acute inflammation and thereby ALI. In this aim, we will
evaluate i) MEAT’s capability to deliver synergistic cytokines to the lung tissues in the pre-clinical mouse model
of ALI, and ii) the performance of MEAT in modulating the immune environment in inflamed lungs. Eventually,
we will investigate the therapeutic efficacy of MEAT in alleviating ALI and restore normal lung functions. The PI
(Early Stage Investigator) has assembled a team with complementary expertise to conduct this project. If
successful, MEAT will revolutionize how ALI is treated and opens a new area for clinical research by unlocking
unrealized applications of ALI cellular immunotherapies."

T lymphocytes are critical mediators of the adaptive immune response, however, they are continuously lost
throughout the lifespan, and therefore must be continuously replaced. The thymus is the primary site of new T
cell generation, and the unique thymic stromal microenvironment directs T cell differentiation, self-tolerance and
self-restriction. However, the size of the thymus declines precipitously beginning relatively early in life, resulting
in declining production of new, naïve T cells. As a result, homeostatic mechanisms driven expansion of memory
cells in the periphery, driving a shift toward an oligoclonal T cell memory, leaving the elderly less responsive to
vaccines and new infections, especially viral infections. Preventing or reversing age-associated thymic atrophy
therefore hold great potential for extending the healthspan in the aging population. The mechanisms governing
thymic atrophy have been difficult to identify, because the primary targets of atrophy, cortical thymic stromal
cells, are rare and difficult to isolate. To understand these mechanisms, we have applied an informatic approach
to characterize the transcriptional response of thymic stromal cells during age-related atrophy or experimentally
induced regeneration. We found that paracrine signaling between medullary and cortical epithelial cells (TECs),
particularly involving the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, was likely to play a key role in the
mechanisms of atrophy and regeneration. To develop tools required test the hypothesis mTEC-derived signals
(particularly FGF21) promote thymus growth, and to facilitate more extensive mechanistic studies of paracrine
regulation of thymus function, we recently identified a gene (LPO) that drives specific expression of mCherry in
most mTEC within the thymus. Here, we propose the generation of similar knock-in mice in which LPO drives
expression of Cre recombinase, allowing tissue-specific genetic manipulation of mTECs. We will also use the
newly generated model to investigate the role of mTEC-derived FGF21 using FGF21LoxP mice."

Congenital ocular malformations such as microphthalmia, anophthalmia and coloboma are prevalent in 1 in 3-
4,000 individuals and are the cause for over 25% of childhood blindness worldwide. Defective closure of the
optic fissure (coloboma) alone may account up to 10% of childhood blindness. Therefore, it is vitally important
to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ocular development. While several causative genes are
identified, more effort is required to define the downstream targets and events underlying eye morphogenesis.
In our previous project, we showed that Porcn signaling needs to be tightly regulated during optic cup
formation and optic fissure closure. The Rho GTPase Cdc42 is critical for optic vesicle invagination and growth
of the optic cup, as well for optic fissure closure. Higher resolution Airyscan imaging revealed the presence of
actin-rich, filopodia-like extensions in the closing fissure. Important gaps in our understanding are how the
fissure margins make contact during the closure process and how growth of optic cup domains is coordinated.
The molecular, unconventional motor Myosin X (Myo10) can induce filopodia formation and is a novel
candidate gene for microphthalmia in humans. Our preliminary data shows that Myo10 mutant mice can exhibit
coloboma and microphthalmia. In Aim 1 of this renewal application, we propose to investigate the role of
Myo10 in ocular tissues using inducible conditional inactivation. Furthermore, the Hippo signaling pathway is a
novel key regulatory pathway controlling distinct processes during mammalian eye development. We
discovered an early role of the upstream regulator neurofibromin 2 (Nf2) in restricting retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) proliferation in the invaginating optic cup, critical for proper optic fissure closure. In Aim 2, we
propose to examine how Nf2 disruption causes extended RPE proliferation in the early optic cup. In addition,
our preliminary data shows an early effect on ocular growth by modulation of Hippo signaling in ocular and
periocular tissues. In Aim 3, we will analyze the precise role of Yap/Taz and Nf2 during early optic cup
morphogenesis. The studies proposed here will be a critical step toward an understanding of the cellular and
molecular mechanisms controlling eye morphogenesis and important for advancing treatment and regenerative
efforts of ocular diseases."

GATA2 is emerging as a key therapeutic target for prostate cancer (PCa) since it plays essential roles in
promoting PCa androgen receptor (AR) expression/activation, tumor growth, and therapy resistance. Although
it is challenging to directly inhibit GATA2 transcriptional activity, enhancing GATA2 protein degradation
represents a promising therapeutic strategy, especially for the lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) and
taxane-resistant CRPC (TxR-CRPC). The underlying molecular mechanism for GATA2 degradation in PCa is
unknown. We identified COP1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, playing essential roles in promoting GATA2 degradation
in PCa. Our preliminary data suggest that COP1 greatly inhibits AR activation and AR+ PCa cell/xenografts
growth. Besides, COP1 re-sensitizes both AR+ and AR– TxR-CRPC to docetaxel, potentially by reversing the
GATA2 overexpression that is acquired during the development of taxane-resistance. Finally, COP1 expression
negatively correlates with AR expression/ activation in public PCa datasets. Based on these exciting data, we
hypothesize that 1) COP1 is the bona fide E3 ligase for GATA2 in PCa. By promoting GATA2 degradation, 2)
COP1 inhibits AR signaling, AR+ PCa growth/castration-resistance, and 3) COP1 represses taxane
chemoresistance of both AR+ and AR– PCa. In Aim 1, we will investigate how COP1 regulates GATA2
degradation in PCa. We will address COP1-mediated GATA2 ubiquitination/degradation, COP1-GATA2
interaction, and the associated molecular mechanisms in PCa/CRPC/TxR-CRPC. In Aim 2, we will investigate
how COP1 regulates AR expression/activation and AR+ PCa/CRPC growth. We will also address the GATA2-
dependent vs. GATA2-independent function of COP1 in regulating AR signaling and AR+ PCa/CRPC growth and
determine how COP1 protein levels correlate with GATA2/AR levels in human PCa tissues. In Aim 3, we will
investigate how COP1 affects the taxane resistance in PCa. We will address how COP1 regulates AR– and AR+
TxR-CRPC and assess the GATA2-dependent vs. GATA2-independent function of COP1 in regulating TxR-
CRPC growth and taxane resistance. Accomplishing these aims will, for the first time, establish COP1 as the
highly sought-after E3 ubiquitin ligase for GATA2 and demonstrate COP1 as a key tumor repressor to potently
suppress PCa, especially the lethal CRPC and TxR-CRPC. These will significantly advance our understanding
of the molecular mechanisms regulating PCa AR expression/activation, tumor growth, castration resistance, and
taxane chemoresistance. Hence, our study is both highly significant and novel."
10908580,"Eukaryotic translation initiation is a complex process involving the ribosome, mRNA, Met-tRNAiMet
and numerous eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Decades of studies driven by those using the
model eukaryote yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the key process is the formation
of codon-anticodon base pairing in the small ribosome P-site. Stringent initiation is enabled by
formation of the 48S ribosomal pre-initiation complex (PIC) strictly at the AUG start codon while
excluding initiation at other sites. Intriguingly, however, many non-canonical start sites are utilized
in some biological contexts and diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The
list of non-AUG start sites within the human genome is far from being complete and how the use
of these sites and hence protein production from these sites are regulated remains an open
question.
Thus, Aim 1 of this grant is to make such a list of non-AUG start sites through genome-wide
translation profiling of well characterized cancer model systems, verify some of these sites
and determine the mechanism driving the observed non-AUG translational regulation in cancer.
The Aim 2 is to study the mechanistic role of 5MP and Met-tRNAiMet adenosine N6-
threonylcarbamoylation (t6A) in controlling non-AUG translation. It will be tested if 5MP
mutations found in many types of cancer can alter initiation accuracy, thereby affecting patients'
prognosis. Our preliminary studies suggested that t6A located 3' of Met-tRNAiMet anticodon can
discriminate specifically against GUG and UUG start codons, in contrast to eIF1 being more
universal non-AUG discriminator. Combining molecular dynamics simulation methods, we will test
if the recently discovered cyclic t6A serves the discriminating role and determine how the
cooperation or competition between t6A and eIF1 promotes stringent initiation and leaky scanning
crucial for translational regulation.
The Aim 3 is to study yet a distinct mechanism of start codon selection that is exploited
during the heat shock response at the translational level. This mechanism was discovered
through translational profiling of yeast eIF3i mutant defective in its interaction with RNA-binding
eIF3g subunit at a high temperature. The working hypothesis assumes that, at a high temperature,
stable PIC formation at the AUG codon requires additional mRNA elements anchoring the
initiating ribosome at its entry site. These hypothetical mRNA elements are located downstream
of the start codon and include a novel eIF3g-binding motif 5'-GUCG-3' and a downstream stem-
loop that potentially binds the entry site-side of the 40S, thereby stabilizing the PIC formation.
This model will tested using yeast as a model system."

Major depression is the leading cause of ill health and disability worldwide according to the World Health
Organization. Although significant progress has been made in understanding the disease and developing
treatments, antidepressants, as the treatment mainstay, are effective for only about 50% of patients, in part due
to the neurobiological and clinical heterogeneity in depression. Developing advanced data-driven techniques by
leveraging machine learning with large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data from randomized clinical trials
provides us a unique opportunity to explore brain biomarkers to identify treatment-predictive neurobiological
phenotypes. Establishing such biomarkers is crucial for reducing the need for multiple drug trials and expediting
remission by sharpening the search for treatment targets. However, integrative analysis of multimodal data for
identifying biomarkers and differentiating individual responses to treatment in depression remains highly
challenging and underexplored. In this proposal, we will develop new data-driven analytical tools to quantify
multimodal moderators and signatures jointly from pre-treatment functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
and electroencephalography (EEG) data for the prediction of treatment response to antidepressant medication.
In Aim 1, we will identify multimodal moderators of treatment effect using data from the Establishing Moderators
and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) trial. A canonical correlation
analysis-based data-driven model will be designed to extract combined features that fuse together
complementary information from both fMRI and EEG modalities. Intent-to-treat prediction linear mixed models
will be used to probe multimodal moderators of antidepressant sertraline versus placebo treatment response. In
Aim 2, we will build a supervised latent space model that unifies the feature fusion and predictive modeling and
apply it to quantify multimodal brain signatures that can predict individual treatment responses to sertraline
versus placebo medication. In Aim 3, we will recruit 50 depressed patients as an independent cohort undergoing
sertraline treatment to optimize and validate the identified multimodal biomarkers. Both fMRI and EEG will be
collected at baseline followed by treatment with the antidepressant medication sertraline (in a manner paralleling
EMBARC procedures) and clinical assessment of outcomes. We will release the developed software tools and
collected data to be publicly available to the research community to facilitate multimodal neuroimaging studies
in other mental disorders."
10806200,"ABSTRACT
Hypoxia is one of the main features of solid tumors including breast cancer and has been shown to
correlate with a poor prognosis. Although many chemotherapeutic agents such as paclitaxel and
doxorubicin are significantly effective in a normoxia environment, they are less effective in hypoxic tumor
regions due to poor infusion, hypoxia, and acidity. Given its significant impact on treatment and tumor
progression, the development of a new approach to specifically target the hypoxic regions of tumors is
clinically needed. To address the challenges (unmet medical needs), our objective for this proposal is to
develop a new probiotic-assisted approach as bacteria preferentially migrate and accumulate in the hypoxic
region of the tumor. We developed our original hypoxia-inducible expression system and have optimized its
use in E. coli G3/10 cells, which have been used as a probiotic in humans. We demonstrated that the G3/10
cells preferentially localized the hypoxic regions of xenografted breast tumors in mice. With the new tools of
the hypoxia-inducible expression system in G3/10 cells, we will deliver cancer-killing cupredoxin proteins,
azurin or rusticyanin, in the hypoxic region of triple-negative breast cancer as they have limited treatment
options and a worse prognosis. We hypothesize that the development of a new bacteria-assisted approach
to express cancer-killing proteins under the hypoxia-inducible promoter will provide functional tools for
specifically targeting hypoxic tumors. To test our hypothesis and improve current therapy, we designed
experiments based on our “bi-directional” strategy; a combination of the G3/10-based therapy with standard
chemotherapeutic agents (paclitaxel and doxorubicin), so that the chemotherapy suppresses tumors in the
outer periphery regions, perfused tumor regions, and our bacterial approach kills tumor in the hypoxic inner
regions. Our preliminary data strongly support this concept. Considering the NIH/NCI’s focusing areas in
FOA PAR-22-085 (Microbial-based Cancer Imaging and Therapy - Bugs as Drugs), we specifically formed a
multidisciplinary team that integrates expertise in basic, translational, and clinical breast cancer biology,
microbiology, molecular biology, immunology, pathology, and biostatistics. With the five years of preclinical
research proposed in this application, we will discern the value of engineered G3/10 cells as effective
bacteria-assisted functional tools. Results from the proposed studies will potentially provide new and
effective treatment strategies that specifically target the hypoxic tumor microenvironment."
10821438,"With the steady growth of longitudinal microbiome studies, microbiomes are now on the cusp of clinical utility for
several diseases, including obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Motivated by the PI’s
broad microbiome collaborations at New York University Langone Health and building upon our extensive and
rich experience in developing novel methods to analyze emerging omics data, we propose to develop two sets
of novel analytic methods to address two computational and analytical challenges in pushing microbiome
research to reach its full clinical potential. In Aim 1, we will take a granular approach to dive into the raw
metagenomics sequencing data and investigate how to analytically detect and differentiate closely related
microbial strains within species. Specifically, we hypothesize that utilizing longitudinal raw metagenomics
sequencing data will produce a more efficient and accurate genetic variants calling scheme than existing
approaches, and we will develop a novel longitudinal metagenomics sequencing processing system to capture
genomic variants, identify primary and secondary strains, and quantify strain proportions within species. The
proposed new tool will be further used to understand how the microbial strains evolve along the time and how to
link the structure variations with host-specific traits. In Aim 2, starting from the recognition of the human
microbiota as a complex ecosystem, we will take a holistic approach to develop a suite of microbial risk scores
to capture the multifaceted characteristics of the microbiome and implement these scores in disease risk
prediction in combination with other omics data. In Aim 3, we will apply the proposed pipelines to two finished
longitudinal microbiome studies and five on-going large scale population-based cancer microbiome studies.
Through the extensive real data analyses, we will validate the proposed methods, illustrate new applications,
and explore future directions. In addition, we will develop, distribute to the community, and provide support for
open-source software packages implementing these methods. The proposal is innovative because it integrates
the overall study design, upstream bioinformatics raw sequencing processing techniques and downstream
statistical modeling with clinical outcomes into a streamlined analytic process to produce unbiased and efficient
analytic tools for microbiome research in longitudinal studies. The proposed work will be conducted by an
experienced multidisciplinary study team. If this work succeeds, it will facilitate the understanding of how bacterial
communities affect human health and disease, and ultimately lead to new approaches to treat or prevent a variety
of health conditions."
10765702,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Salmonellosis continues to be a major Public Health challenge resulting in more than 300,000 death world-
wide. In the US alone, Salmonella causes an estimated 1 million infections resulting in annual economic
burden of $2.8 billion. Salmonella enterica encompasses multiple serovars that are associated with distinct
pathogenic features and host specificities. Some serovars (e. g. S. Typhimurium) exhibit broad host specificity,
cause self-limiting gastroenteritis, and are one of the most common causes of food-borne illnesses in the
industrialized world. In contrast, other serovars such as S. Typhi exhibit remarkable host specificity limiting
their ecology to the human host where it causes typhoid fever, a systemic disease that leads to an estimated
200,000 deaths worldwide. The pathogenicity of all S. enterica serovars requires the activity of two type III
protein secretion systems (T3SS) encoded within their pathogenicity islands 1 and 2. These T3SSs direct the
translocation of a battery of bacterial effectors with the capacity to modulate a variety of cellular functions.
Working in conjunction with one another, these effectors modulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics, host-cell gene
expression, vesicle trafficking, and innate and acquired immune responses, thus allowing Salmonella to gain
access to and replicate within host cells, avoid host defenses, induce intestinal inflammation, and reach deeper
tissues. Despite the significant progress, however, much remains to be learned as the biochemical activities
and/or relevant cellular targets of many Salmonella effectors remain uncharacterized. The objective of this
proposed research is to study host/Salmonella interactions that are shaped by the coordinated activities of its
T3SS effectors. We will focus our efforts on the study of mechanisms by which an intrinsic host defense
pathway controls Salmonella replication within cells, and how the bacteria counter this defense mechanism
with its effector proteins. In addition, we will examine how some of this effector proteins trigger intestinal
inflammation, which is critical for Salmonella pathogenesis. These studies will advance the understanding of
the cell biology of Salmonella enterica infections and potentially facilitate the development of novel therapeutic
and prevention strategies. Furthermore, these studies may establish new paradigms of host-pathogen
interactions that may be applicable to other important pathogens that have evolved close associations with
their respective hosts."
10851012,"ENhancing exercise with LIGHT to improve functioning in PAD: the ENLIGHTEN PAD Trial
 Walking exercise is first line therapy for people disabled by lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD).
However, walking exercise does not eliminate disability due to PAD. Even after completing one of our
successful exercise interventions that meaningfully improved six-minute walk distance, 82% of 192 PAD
participants still reported ischemic leg symptoms after the six-minute walk. Our LITE randomized trial of 305
people with PAD showed that, compared to a control group that did not exercise, home-based walking exercise
that induced ischemic leg symptoms (i.e. high intensity) significantly improved six-minute walk, while home-
based exercise that did not induce ischemic leg symptoms (i.e. low intensity) had no effect on six-minute walk.
Despite greater benefits, ischemic leg symptoms during high intensity exercise reduced exercise adherence.
We hypothesize that 670 nm light therapy, administered before home-based walking exercise, will increase
minutes of high intensity exercise and enhance the benefits of exercise in PAD.
 Nitric oxide (NO) is an endogenous signaling molecule with therapeutic properties that improve limb
perfusion and reverses the skeletal muscle pathology present in PAD. 670 nm light treatment of the lower
extremities increases plasma nitrosothiols, a major source of NO activity. In our preliminary study, 670 nm
light treatment of the legs acutely increased lower extremity arterial flow and six-minute walk distance in people
with PAD. Therefore, we hypothesize that 670 nm light treatment of the legs immediately before walking
exercise sessions will acutely increase nitrosothiols and NO and facilitate greater exercise intensity, thereby
enhancing the chronic benefits of exercise in people with PAD.
 The ENLIGHTEN PAD Trial will collect preliminary data to test whether, in people with PAD, daily 670 nm
light treatment of the lower extremities immediately before home-based walking exercise sessions improves
six-minute walk distance at 4-month follow-up, compared to sham light. In primary aim #1, we will test whether
670 nm light + home-based exercise increases six-minute walk distance more than sham light + home-based
exercise at 4-month follow-up. In primary aim #2, we will measure the acute effect of the first treatment of 670
nm light on six-minute walk distance and on walking intensity (measured with the ActiGraph accelerometer)
during the six-minute walk. In secondary and exploratory aims, we will delineate biologic pathways by which
670 nm light enhances the benefits of walking exercise, by measuring the effects of 670 nm light on plasma
nitrosothiols, leg perfusion, and gastrocnemius muscle health. If our hypotheses are correct, we will use
results of this Phase II Trial to design a definitive clinical trial to test whether 670 nm light, a safe, accessible,
and well-tolerated therapy, enhances the benefits of exercise, thereby improving mobility and quality of life in
the large and growing number of older people disabled by PAD."

Craniofacial anomalies accompany a third of all birth defects, with isolated or nonsyndromic clefts of the lip and
palate (CL/P) alone occurring in 1/700 births worldwide. These isolated CL/P have a complex etiology including
both genetic and environmental factors. Isolated cleft palate (CP) alone accounts for 1/1700 cases in the US. In
addition, there are >400 syndromes with CP as a phenotype. Environmental factors such as folate intake and
smoking have been shown to affect maternal environment. While dietary maternal folic acid supplementation
has consistently shown ameliorative effects on neural tube defects, its effect on reducing the occurrence of CL/P
has been variable both in human and in mouse models. Sources of this variability include the dosage and delivery
of folic acid as well as ability to assess the impact of the treatment in mouse models. Several human studies
have speculated that low folic acid dose is not sufficient to prevent CL/P, and that higher doses are more
effective. Our preliminary data indicate that a high daily dose of folic acid given intraperitoneally to pregnant mice
in two short developmental windows is sufficient to rescue CP in utero in Specc1l mouse model of CP. Specc1l
deficiency leads to actin cytoskeletal defects, which results in palatal shelf elevation delay. We have developed
several quantitative 2-D and 3-D analyses to characterize the timing and cellular changes that occur during
palatal shelf growth and elevation. We posit that in utero folic acid supplementation has an ameliorative effect
on the dynamics of palate closure. In contrast to neural tube defects, we argue that rescue of CP requires a
higher daily dose of folic acid administered intraperitoneally but for a short window of time. To our knowledge,
we are the first to use intraperitoneal injection of folic acid to rescue CP. Folic acid has been used extensively in
human studies and has been safe even at relatively high doses. The objective of this proposal is to determine
the minimum possible dose and treatment window for an effective rescue of CP and to study which aspects of
palate closure dynamics are impacted by folic acid supplementation. We will also use sophisticated proteomic
and phosphoproteomic analysis of palatal shelf tissue to determine the molecular consequence of folic acid
treatment. Together, these studies will establish the experimental system and methods to study maternal folic
acid rescue of CP in mice that can be applied to other mouse models. Importantly, these studies will lead to
future therapeutic strategies to reduce the incidence of CL/P in humans."
10861083,"Neighborhood parks hold great potential as attractive and accessible settings to promote and enhance physical
activity (PA) among racially/ethnically diverse low-income youth. However, little park-based intervention
research has been conducted to explore how this potential might be realized. No previous park-level
intervention has experimentally evaluated youth sports program fee waivers or intensive park outreach
strategies to increase child enrollment and participation in park-based youth sports programs. The proposed
research combines these promising intervention strategies into a single intervention and uses a gold-standard
randomized controlled study design, and focuses on a low-income, racially/ethnically diverse sample at highest
risk for developmental declines in physical activity. The proposed study evaluates the effects of a park-level
intervention to increase moderate/vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and decrease sedentary time among low-
income racially/ethnically diverse children ages 6-12 yrs. Neighborhood parks (n=24) will be randomized for a
2-year period to one of two experimental conditions: 1) Intensive Outreach and Youth Sports Program Fee
Waiver; or 2) Comparison Condition: Current Outreach and Youth Sports Program Fee Structure. The
intervention outreach and fee waiver components are expected to support parents to enroll their child in park-
based youth sports programs by decreasing social/cultural and economic barriers to child enrollment and
participation. The evaluation cohort will consist of 432 children ages 6-12 yrs who reside in one of the 24 park
neighborhoods randomized to the experimental conditions. Measurements from individual children will be
collected at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months. Specific Aims of this research are: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate
the effects of a park-level intervention on changes in child MVPA over 6, 12 and 24 months; Specific Aim 2:
To evaluate the effects of a park-level interventions on changes in child sedentary behavior over 6, 12 and 24
months; Exploratory Aim 3: To evaluate the effects of a park-level interventions on changes in parent light
activity and sedentary behavior over 6, 12 and 24 months. Hypothesis 1: Children who live in a neighborhood
where the park is randomized to intensive park outreach and fee waiver will have larger increases in MVPA
and decreases in sedentary behavior at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to children who live in a comparison
neighborhood. Hypothesis 2: Parents of children who live in a neighborhood where the park is randomized to
intensive park outreach and fee waiver will have larger increases in light PA and decreases in sedentary
behavior at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to parents of children who live in a comparison neighborhood.
IMPACT: The proposed research will provide evidence about the effectiveness of a park-based intervention
that includes intensive park outreach and youth sports program fee waivers on changes in child physical
activity in low-income, diverse urban communities. It will provide critical information needed to support policies
and programs that reduce disparities in physical activity among high risk youth."
10893514,"Atrial remodeling, including dilation and fibrosis, can lead to hemodynamic deterioration and atrial fibrillation.
As a consequence, cardiac output declines and atrial clots embolize to the brain, intestines and other organs.
While valve surgery and anticoagulation therapy reduce heart failure and stroke, there are nevertheless
numerous patients who would benefit from a therapy inhibiting atrial remodeling and its consequences. To
address this urgent unmet clinical need, we here propose to investigate the role of macrophages, the fourth
most numerous cardiac cell, in atrial remodeling. In preliminary work for this application, i) we developed and
validated a new mouse model of atrial remodeling that combines key clinical risk factors, ii) we obtained single-
cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the left atria of mice with atrial remodeling, iii) we determined the
ontogeny of atrial macrophages in the steady state and after atrial remodeling, and iv) we established a
pipeline for scRNA-seq of human left atrial tissues from patients with atrial disease undergoing heart surgery at
MGH. We now propose to test if macrophages form the atria's Achilles' heel promoting atrial remodeling,
fibrosis and atrial fibrillation. We will explore the role of macrophage subsets in atrial remodeling using genetic
and pharmaceutical cell depletion strategies. We hypothesize that during atrial remodeling, disease-promoting
macrophages are derived from blood monocytes while locally sourced macrophages are protective. In these
studies, we will profile structural remodeling of the left atrium by echocardiography, hemodynamic and
electrophysiological studies, histological analysis and FACS followed by real-time qPCR. Our preliminary
scRNA-seq data provide us with a wealth of potential targets to study the causal role of fibrosis-related
macrophage genes in atrial remodeling by loss- and gain-of-function studies. We will test the hypothesis that
gene deletion in bone marrow-derived cells, i.e. recruited macrophage subsets, attenuates atrial fibrosis by
cross-talk to fibroblasts and reduced collagen deposition, leading to less atrial remodeling and reduced
inducibility of atrial fibrillation. In a translational aim, we will study macrophage heterogeneity in human atrial
tissues by scRNA-seq. We will focus on the comparison between human and mouse scRNA-seq data sets
using state-of-the-art computational methods to steer the preclinical discovery work towards pathways that are
important in human disease. Our collaborative application unites an interdisciplinary team with expertise in
immunology, cardiovascular science and computational biology. While the novel research plan is ambitious, we
believe that our preliminary data demonstrate feasibility and provide us with a unique opportunity to study a
question with high clinical relevance."
10877855,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death with little improvement in survivability over many decades.
Understanding and support for lung cancer have suffered from the stigma that the disease is merely a
consequence of tobacco use, when in fact other agents are a major factor in the disease. Many people with lung
cancer have never used tobacco and only a minority of tobacco users actually get lung cancer. However, while
lung cancer kills more people than colon, breast and prostate cancer combined, it receives less federal funding
than each of these cancers alone. Chromosome instability (CIN) is a hallmark of lung cancer. All established
lung carcinogens cause CIN, yet the mechanisms for how they do have received little attention. Metal exposure
is a worldwide health concern. Metals cause lung cancer, and carcinogenic metals are a component in tobacco.
Metals are poor mutagens but potently induce CIN, yet, how metals cause lung cancer and CIN is poorly
understood. We focus our R35 program on understanding the mechanisms for how metal carcinogens induce
CIN in lung cancer. We use hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], a human lung carcinogen of major public health
concern, as our primary metal of interest, although we will compare Cr(VI) outcomes with other metal lung
carcinogens. We will study how Cr(VI) induces structural and numerical CIN, considering human lung fibroblast,
epithelial and induced pluripotent stem cell models. We will progress our studies from individual cell types to
more complex, three-dimensional, mixed cell culture studies. We enhance and deepen our understanding of
these mechanisms with a One Environmental Health approach, which leverages the ability of wildlife to resist
Cr(VI)-induced CIN and provide novel insights into its carcinogenic mechanism. Moreover, we maximize the
impact of these findings by translating our outcomes into animals and into a powerful and unique collection of
human subjects and populations ranging from workers with primarily Cr(VI) exposure, to workers with a mixed
metal exposure including Cr. This combined approach of humans, animals and cell lines with One Environmental
Health tools will give us unprecedented insight into how metals induce structural and numerical CIN. In particular,
we will define: 1) key mechanisms for metal-induced CIN; 2) how these mechanisms persist and are heritable at
the cellular level to cause neoplastic disease; and 3) how they translate to animals and humans. Thus, our
proposed R35 program will revolutionize our understanding of Cr(VI), CIN, metal carcinogenesis, and lung
cancer while also providing important insights for other cancers that involve CIN. Outcomes will include major
scientific breakthroughs in understanding: 1) how metals cause normal human lung cells to become neoplastic;
2) how to detect this neoplastic transformation when it occurs; 3) how to more effectively target lung cells that
have transformed and 4) how to prevent neoplastic change from occurring, leading to improved risk assessment,
treatments, and health outcomes for people exposed to metals."
10881894,"Project Summary:
 Atrial fibrillation (Afib) is a common arrhythmia that is currently difficult to manage. Afib catheter
ablation is more effective than medical therapy for maintaining normal rhythm. However, treatment failure is
common, around 50% for persistent forms of Afib. Attempts to improve outcomes by performing more
extensive ablation have been limited by new arrhythmias, like atrial flutter, which can be caused by the
procedure. Outcomes can be improved by repeat procedures, but arrhythmia recurrence is still common.
Surgical procedures have higher success for treating Afib, but the successful techniques are prohibitively
invasive for treating most patients. Methods to improve the success of the first Afib catheter ablation
procedure are needed.
 Ablation failure is thought to be due to the inability to create properly placed, permanent ablation
lesions. Currently, transient tissue injury and edema caused by ablation can make ablation appear complete
at the end of the procedure. However, as transient injury resolves over days to weeks, arrhythmia can recur.
Current methods for determining whether ablation is finished cannot tell the difference between permanent
and transient tissue injury. Methods that show where additional ablation needs to be performed and confirm
that permanent ablation has been completed are expected to improve the success of Afib ablation.
 We have developed a non-contrast MRI method for seeing permanent ablation lesions. We recently
showed this method can see ablation lesions in the thin walled atrium, which is the part of the heart that
causes Afib. Because this method does not need intravenous contrast, it can be repeated during a procedure
until complete ablation is confirmed.
 This proposal will find out if this method can 1) detect sites of incomplete Afib ablation, 2) guide
additional ablation to these sites, and 3) confirm ablation is complete at the end of the procedure. This
proposal also translates this method, previously developed in animals, to patients undergoing Afib ablation.
 Effective acute assessment of ablative treatment would provide an important component of
feedback not currently available for procedure guidance. Successful completion of these aims will
introduce a new paradigm for confirming ablation completion in order to reduce arrhythmia recurrence
following AFib ablation. These methods could also be applied to other arrhythmias where incomplete
ablation contributes to poor ablation outcomes, like ventricular tachycardia."
10831061,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Sexual minority adolescents (SMA) are disproportionately affected by mental health problems such as
depression and suicidality relative to their heterosexual peers. These disparities are greatest during
adolescence and persist into adulthood, and are generally attributed to the unique interpersonal stressors that
they face (e.g., sexual orientation-related rejection). Given that rejection is a robust risk factor for mental health
problems, especially during adolescence, it has historically been the focus of research on SM individuals'
mental health. However, in addition to experiences of rejection, expectations of rejection and the emotions that
accompany them also play important roles in mental health. The rejection sensitivity (RS) theory proposes that
early experiences of rejection can lead to a disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely
react to rejection, which can then compromise one's mental health. Despite evidence that RS is associated
with a range of mental health problems among SM adults, our understanding of its development and role in
SMA's mental health is limited in several important ways (e.g., nearly all prior studies have been cross-
sectional studies of adults, and there has been a lack of attention to different emotions that can accompany
expectations of rejection as well as underlying mechanisms and protective factors).
 Given these gaps, the goals of the proposed R01 are to determine the role of sexual orientation-related
rejection in the development of different types of RS and their respective mental health consequences among
SMA, to identify the mechanisms through which RS influences mental health in this population, and to identify
protective factors in the development of RS. We will recruit a cohort of 500 SMA (ages 14-17) to participate in
a longitudinal and experience-sampling study using methods established in our team's prior work. Data will be
collected at four biannual assessments (baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-months) to determine the longitudinal relations
among sexual orientation-related rejection, RS (anxious and angry), and mental health (depression symptoms
and clinical elevations, suicidal ideation, and reactive aggression). In addition, participants will complete a 6-
week experience-sampling study (4 assessments per day, administered in two 3-week bursts) to examine
antecedents and consequences of RS as they occur in daily life. These data will be used to accomplish three
specific aims: (1) Determine the longitudinal and daily relations among sexual orientation-related rejection, RS
(anxious and angry), and mental health (depression, suicidal ideation, and reactive aggression); (2) Identify
mechanisms (social withdrawal, self- and other-blame in response to rejection, and sexual orientation
concealment) underlying the longitudinal and daily relations between RS and mental health problems; and (3)
Examine sexual orientation-related social support and acceptance as protective factors in the development of
RS. The proposed R01 will advance our understanding of the development of RS, its consequences, the
underlying mechanisms, and protective factors, which will inform interventions to improve SMA's mental health."
10809666,"ABSTRACT
 Kinase signaling exquisitely orchestrates each step of neuronal development, beginning at neurogenesis
to neuronal integration into functional synaptic networks. Through their highly specific substrate phosphorylation,
protein kinases regulate neuronal growth, activity and their plasticity. Despite the increasing evidence for a critical
and causative role of kinase dysfunction in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD), the mechanisms through which
the human kinome controls neuronal development and how its dysfunction manifests in disease remain major
gaps in the field of neurodevelopmental biology. In this proposal, we will investigate the role of protein kinase
TAOK1, genetic mutations in which have been strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder, macrocephaly
and neurodevelopmental delay. Based on our preliminary findings, the central hypothesis of this research
proposal is that TAOK1 is a pleiotropic kinase that regulates neuronal development through its ability to directly
bind phospholipids and remodel the neuronal membrane, and that dysfunction in TAOK1 signaling lead to
neuropathogenesis. Our data show that (a) both de novo and inherited TAOK1 mutations in NDD induce aberrant
neuronal membrane extensions that disrupt neuronal morphology and function and (b) TAOK1 can directly bind
phosphoinositides enriched in the plasma membrane. Through integration of innovative approaches in
proteomics, chemical-genetics, structural biology, stem cell technology and human disease relevant model
systems, we seek to (Aim1) understand the mechanisms through which TAOK1 signaling mediates neuronal
development, (Aim2) determine the biological principles that govern TAOK1 membrane binding and remodeling,
and (Aim3) generate human stem cell derived neuronal models of TAOK1 associated disease in order to
determine developmental perturbations as well as phosphoproteomic changes due to deficits in TAOK1
signaling. These studies will provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of a high confidence gene in the
etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders."
