Black/African-Americans use alcohol and illicit drugs at the same rates as their White counterparts but are
much more likely to suffer negative substance related consequences. Moreover, they are less likely to initiate
treatment when compared with other racial groups; and when they do, are significantly less likely to complete
treatment or to be offered evidence-based treatments. Stigma, mistrust of the medical system, lack of health
care coverage, complex pathways to care, lower socioeconomic status, and the scarcity of culturally-informed
treatment may all be factors underlying low treatment initiation and engagement. Thus, offering treatment in
alternative settings, such as the Black Church, a highly trusted entity in Black communities, is a novel, and
potentially highly disseminable strategy for improving both access to evidence-based treatments and alcohol
treatment outcomes for this important population. Technology-based treatments are an emerging strategy for
reaching underserved populations and can address barriers to delivering interventions in novel settings. One
such strategy, computer-based training for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT4CBT), has been demonstrated
in multiple randomized clinical trials to be safe and effective in reducing alcohol and other substance use, both
as an add on to treatment, and as a stand-alone treatment, relative to standard care.
We recently demonstrated the feasibility of both conducting a rigorous clinical trial as well as delivering
CBT4CBT in the Black Church, which demonstrated overwhelming levels of interest and enthusiasm from
Black adults with AUD, as well as highly promising levels of engagement and treatment completion. We now
propose an 8-week randomized clinical trial in which 200 Black adults with primary AUD will be randomized to
either CBT4CBT in the Black church or referral to standard treatment in a specialty addiction setting, with a 9-
month follow-up to evaluate durability of treatment effects. Primary outcomes include retention (initiation of
treatment, engagement for at least 4 weeks) and percent days abstinent from alcohol (PDA). Selected
participant characteristics (e.g., gender, ethnic identity, religiosity, severity of AUD, mental health diagnoses,
and vulnerabilities in the social determinants of health) will be evaluated as potential moderators of outcome.
Secondary outcomes include satisfaction with care, expansion of social support networks, reduction in heavy
drinking days and in WHO drinking levels, effects on comorbid substance use, and overall quality of life.
Moreover, if CBT4CBT is demonstrated to be effective with Black adults with AUD in this setting, this would
represent an inexpensive strategy to address health disparities that could be disseminated with relative ease
among the large network of denominations serving Black individuals in the US."

Recent scientific advancements have made chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy a prom1s1ng treatment option for relapsed and refractory cancers. In this strategy, T cells are extracted from the patient and reprogrammed and then reinfused into the subject to seek out and destroy cancer cells. However, not all individuals respond to this treatment and therefore a better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie antitumor immune cell function is required to improve response rates. Successful therapy has been linked to increased CART expansion, long-term persistence as well as early memory differentiation, and approaches to augment these properties could greatly enhance CAR T cell potency. DNA modifying enzymes such as the methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 may be involved in the control of T cell differentiation and function, and TET2 disruption leads to increased T cell proliferation, longevity, and early memory differentiation. However, the role of TET2 in regulating CAR T cell fate and function is not well understood. I hypothesize that TET2 catalytically and non-catalytically regulates CAR T cell differentiation and antitumor activity by direct alteration of DNA methylation status as well as through chromatin remodeling. The catalytic function of TET2 induces active DNA demethylation through successive oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5- formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). Demethylation is then achieved through either passive dilution of 5hmC or active excision of 5fC and 5caC. The biological impact of these two active demethylation pathways in CART cells is not understood. In Aim 1, I propose to elucidate the role of TET2-catalyzed changes to the methylome in mediating CART cell differentiation and effector function. I postulate that the active excision commitment step converting 5hmC to 5fC is indispensable for TET2-mediated control of T cell differentiation and antitumor function. To evaluate this, I will investigate the effect of halting oxidation at the 5hmC step on differentiation, antitumor function, and global as well as site-specific DNA methylation profiles in CAR T cells. Additionally, TET2 impacts chromatin structure through both catalytic and non-catalytic mechanisms involving interactions between histone modification proteins. The role of TET2-induced changes to chromatin structure on T cell fate is also currently unknown. In Aim 2, I will determine how chromatin remodeling by TET2 impacts regulation of CAR T cell differentiation and function. I hypothesize that TET2 influences changes to local chromatin structure through catalytic and non-catalytic activities to regulate CAR T cell differentiation and antitumor function. Thus, I will investigate the effect of eliminating TET2 catalytic function on the differentiation, antitumor efficacy and the epigenetic landscape of CAR T cells compared to simultaneous knockout of both catalytic and non-catalytic activity and stalled catalytic function. Together, these aims will improve our understanding of TET2 function in regulating T cell-mediated tumor control and inform strategies to safely modulate TET2 activity to improve outcomes with CART cell therapy."

Endovascular surgeries (ES) increasingly augment or replace traditional open surgical treatment of brain, liver,
heart, and vascular diseases due to their improved clinical outcomes, faster recovery times, and improved mor-
tality rates. These surgeries are commonly performed by inserting endovascular equipment into the groin or arm
and navigating to distal arteries through a combination of axial loading and rotation of the base of the tools,
utilizing the curved tips to deﬂect into intended locations and vessels. Despite the many beneﬁts of endovascular
surgeries, vascular anatomy, particularly for elderly patients who represent a large portion of those undergoing
such procedures, can demonstrate excessive tortuosity and severe angulation, leading to high-risk , time-intensive
procedures that can only be performed by a select number of expertly trained specialists. The small number
of specialists results in limited access to necessary treatment, and patients are forced to either wait and travel
for treatment or to not receive treatment at all. There is therefore a critical need for new endovascular robotic
surgical tools that are safe, e↵ective, and that enable more surgeons to successfully navigate challenging anatomies.
To address this need, a new soft-robotic approach called VINE – Vascular Internal Navigation by
Extension – will be used. When pressurized with ﬂuid, these VINEs navigate via extension at their tip in a man-
ner analogous to how plants grow, creating shapes with complex curvatures. These VINEs are inherently safer
due to their soft structure and represent a fundamentally di↵erent method of movement. The overall objective of
this work is to characterize the behavior and reﬁne the design of the VINE for ES, including the shape control
methods, and to validate its e""cacy and safety. The central hypothesis is that this new method of shape control
and navigation via tip-extension enables VINEs to safely and e↵ectively traverse the vasculature. The central
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three speciﬁc aims: (1) characterize and reﬁne small-scale, pre-shaped and
steerable VINE designs for ES, (2) evaluate VINE e""cacy in bench-top models, and (3) validate the safety of the
entire VINE system in an in vivo pig study. This work will serve as a ﬁrst step towards achieving the long-term
goal of creating a soft robotic catheterization system, operable by a large number of surgeons, to increase access
to high-quality surgical treatment.
This work is innovative in that the proposed VINE is the ﬁrst everting, robotic catheter with shape control and
represents a substantive departure from the status quo, which currently relies on pushing semi-rigid instruments
from their proximal end. The expected contribution of this work is a preliminary soft, tip-extending robotic system
capable of safely and e↵ectively navigating around acute turns and through winding paths of the vasculature, which
is signiﬁcant since it will ultimately lead to increased access to high-quality minimally invasive procedures."

The innate and adaptive immune response against allografts is the main impediment to successful transplantation.
Heart transplantation is the best option for selected pediatric and adult patients with end-stage heart failure,
however, the threat of rejection remains high, despite improvements in immunosuppressive therapies, conditioning
regimens and medical care. Importantly, currently used interventions are not donor-specific and therefore may
cause increased risk of infections and cancer. A deeper understanding of the basis of allo-recognition is needed
for the development of novel donor-specific therapies to treat graft rejection minimizing the harmful side effects.
 Recent studies have challenged the dogma that initiation or re-activation of anti-donor immunity in graft-
draining secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) depends mainly on donor Ag-presenting cells (APCs) mobilized from
the grafts. Increasing evidence and our preliminary studies indicate that heart and non-vascularized skin allografts
release extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying donor-Ag that traffic to the SLTs where the graft EVs stimulate donor-
reactive B cells and T cells. Despite increasing information during the past 5 years on the role of graft EVs on
elicitation of anti-donor immunity and their potential use as biomarkers in transplantation, the mechanisms in vivo
by which graft EVs interact with recipient’s immune cells in graft-draining SLTs and promote anti-donor immunity
remain largely unknown.
 The family of EVs encompasses vesicles with different biogenesis, size and composition that includes
exosomes and microvesicles. Although growing evidence indicates that EVs represent a mechanism by which
cells horizontally transfer proteins, mRNAs, non-coding RNAs and lipids, the function of EVs in vivo remains an
enigma. Therefore, we propose to investigate the mechanisms in vivo by which graft EVs initiate or re-activate
in graft-draining SLTs, the innate and adaptive immune responses that lead to rejection of allografts. We will
analyze these mechanisms in mouse experimental models of cardiac and non-vascularized skin allografts.
 We hypothesize that “graft EVs constitute a cell-free platform that by multiple mechanisms initiates
or re-activates the anti-donor immune response in the recipient’s SLTs”. This application will investigate
these mechanisms in situ and in vivo using transplant models in mice and a translational model in humanized
mice. We will test our hypothesis in the following aims: Aim 1 will investigate the origin of graft EVs and their
effects on recipient APCs in graft-draining SLTs, Aim 2 will analyze the mechanisms by which graft EVs generate
anti-donor B cell immunity in SLTs and Aim 3 will analyze how graft EVs elicit anti-donor T cell immunity in SLTs
and its relevance to transplantation in humans. Our long-term goal is to understand how graft EVs function in
vivo to provide new grounds for development of EV-based therapies and disease markers of clinical relevance
to transplantation and immune-mediated disorders."

Post-transcriptional modifications of mRNA have emerged as a central regulatory mechanism in genetic
information flow. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant post-transcriptional modification in
eukaryotic mRNAs. m6A mRNA methylation is reversible and dynamically regulated by writers, erasers and
readers. Writers are methyltransferases that install the methyl group on adenosine residues, erasers are
demethylases that remove the methyl group, and readers are proteins that recognize and interact with the m6A
site. m6A methylation influences all fundamental aspects of mRNA metabolism, including mRNA processing,
stability and translation. Despite tremendous progresses, the in vivo roles of m6A mRNA methylation in
macrophage biology remains unclear. Sepsis is a major clinical problem and leading cause of death in patients
in intensive care units. Sepsis is usually caused by Gram-negative bacterial infection that triggers a fast
cytokine storm. Macrophages as the first line of defense are the predominant producer of pro-inflammatory
cytokines during infection. Proper resolution of the cytokine response is essential for the host's well-being. The
intensity and duration of cytokine storm is delicately regulated by negative feedback regulatory loops, and the
SOCS family of proteins are the central players of this feedback regulatory mechanism. We have sought to
understand the role of m6A methylation in macrophage biology by genetically targeting METTL14, a core
subunit of the m6A methyltransferase (a writer). We found that mice carrying METTL14 deletion in myeloid
cells are hypersensitive in both cecal ligation puncture (CLP)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis
models. These tissue-specific METTL14-mutant mice produced and maintained much higher levels of serum
pro-inflammatory cytokines and suffered much higher mortality than control mice. METTL14-depleted
macrophages produced and sustained much higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than the control
macrophages, and the underlying cause is that METTL14 deletion impairs SOCS1 induction in macrophages
following bacterial infection or LPS challenge. Our data support the hypothesis that m6A methylation plays a
critical role in controlling the intensity and resolution of cytokine storm in sepsis by increasing Socs1 mRNA
stability and translation. Our data strongly suggest that LPS or bacterial infection activates the NF-κB pathway
that stimulates Socs1 mRNA transcription; LPS/bacterial infection further increases Socs1 m6A methylation by
promoting FTO (an eraser) mRNA degradation, and then YTHDF1 (a reader) binds to the Socs1 m6A sites to
promote Socs1 mRNA stability and increase its translation. In this proposal we will validate that SOCS1 is an
essential METTL14 target to control macrophage activation in septic response using in vivo and in vitro models
(Aim 1), validate that YTHDF1 is a critical reader to promote Socs1 mRNA stability and translation in septic
response (Aim 2), and validate that FTO is a critical eraser whose mRNA degradation promotes Socs1 m6A
methylation and greatly contributes to negative feedback control of macrophage activation (Aim 3)."

Retention in HIV care is associated with longer survival, viral suppression, and lower HIV transmission. HIV
disproportionally affects men who have sex with men (MSM). In Peru, the HIV epidemic is concentrated among
them (prevalence 12.2%), while only 0.4% of the general population is HIV+. Worryingly, MSM with HIV are
less likely to stay engaged in care! than other population groups. Studies with MSM have reported efficacy of
text-message (SMS) reminders for retesting of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. However, more
trials are needed with them in order to assess the use of SMS for increasing retention in HIV care in resource-
limited settings, such as in Latin America. Two-way text messaging can provide an increased level of real-time
support to patients. WelTel was the first randomized controlled trial using an interactive two-way text
messaging approach that reported a significant increase in self-reported adherence and viral suppression. The
hypothesis for this study is that an upgraded version of WelTel to deliver an interactive two-way SMS-based
intervention will increase retention in care among HIV+ MSM in Peru. This career development award seeks:
1) to develop an SMS-based intervention to be delivered through the WelTel system to increase retention in
HIV care among HIV-positive MSM at a government-based hospital in Peru; and 2) to determine the efficacy of
the intervention for increasing retention in HIV care when compared with standard-of-care. I will recruit 208
HIV+ MSM and randomize them (1:1) to an intervention (receives the SMS-based intervention) and control
(standard of care) group. I will follow them up throughout the duration of the twelve months course. The main
outcome will be retention in HIV care within one year after enrollment. Results will be used to design a multi-
site trial to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in improving retention in HIV care among HIV+
Peruvian MSM that will be submitted for R01 funding. A multi-disciplinary mentoring team will support me with
expertise in areas related to my career plan: HIV prevention trials (Dr. Duerr), mobile health (Dr. Blas and Dr.
Lester), HIV research (Dr. Gonzales), implementation science (Dr. Zunt), qualitative research (Dr. Galea),
quantitative methods (Dr. Carcamo), and evaluation of interventions (Dr. Garcia). With them, I have designed a
training plan to fill the gaps in knowledge and skills I need to succeed in my goals. I will obtain additional formal
training in qualitative research and implementation science, and! statistical and epidemiological methods. I will
also acquire skills in grant/manuscript writing and I will pursue continuous training in responsible conduct of
research. This mentored research training support will enable me to achieve my goal of becoming a leading
global health researcher at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, actively collaborating with top international
institutions and fostering health policies with rigorous evidence."

Antibiotic persistence remains one of the most challenging barriers to effective clearance of chronic bacterial
infections. Despite the intervening decades since its original discovery, we still lack a basic understanding of
how molecular networks implement the defining features of persistence: phenotypic heterogeneity and tolerance
to lethal levels of antibiotic exposure. Much of the work on persistence has been phenomenological and the
mechanistic studies which, so far, have only focused on a few candidate pathways, have failed to provide an
adequate understanding of this complex phenotype. Here, we propose an unbiased systems biology approach
to characterize the genetic and regulatory underpinnings of persistence. A primary aim is to precisely define the
cellular state of persister cells which typically make up only a small (< 10-4) fraction of the population. We will
utilize our previously developed genetic and chemically induced models of E. coli hyper-persistence to trigger
persister cells, and to follow the trajectory of their phenotypic diversification by using our recently developed
single-cell RNA sequencing technology (PETRI-seq). This will enable us to define the dynamics of the process
at single-cell resolution, and identify highly specific persister markers, which we can use to purify them to near-
homogeneity. We will then profile the global gene regulatory state of persisters by using our recently optimized
technologies for in vivo Protein-DNA and RNA-RNA interactions. Combining the single-cell RNA atlas and global
regulatory interactions will enable us to generate causal graphical models of pivotal regulatory events that
underlie persister formation. We will utilize our recently developed CRISPR-interference technology (CALM) to
systematically determine how knock-down perturbations to all essential and non-essential genes affect
quantitative parameters of persistence, including persister-fraction and kill-rates. Finally, by combining the
regulatory and genetic maps of persistence, we will identify and validate the most critical vulnerability nodes
whose targeting will eliminate persister formation and survival. The massive scale of these observations will
reveal the most comprehensive and unbiased global view of persister generation, gene regulation, and
physiology, to date. This is a critical foundation upon which we can devise rational strategies for reducing the
clinical burden of persisters. Finally, the unique conceptual and technological approaches here will serve as a
blueprint for exploring the genetic and regulatory basis of other complex bacterial phenomena, such as biofilms,
where phenotypic heterogeneity is a defining hallmark."

Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer death in women. The overall 5-year survival rate for epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC), the most common type, remains approximately 30% over the last several decades. High-
grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and lethal form of EOC. Thus, the novel strategies
for treating HGSOC are urgently needed. Cancer cells often carry genetic defects that provide opportunities for
specific targeting. Expression of the B55 α, a regulatory subunit of the heterotrimeric serine/threonine
phosphatase PP2A, is reduced in 46% of ovarian cancers, as a result of loss of heterozygosity. Our recent novel
genome-wide synthetic lethality screen discovered that B55 α reduction led to the enhanced sensitivity of cells
to an inhibitor targeting replication stress response kinase CHK1. Currently, inhibitors of CHK1 and its upstream
effector ATR are being tested in clinical trials without precise guidance of biomarkers to identify responsive
populations, which significantly reduce the efficacy of these agents. Thus, the goal of this application is to
establish the molecular basis for targeting B55 α defective HGSOC by ATR/CHK1 inhibitors and for B55 α being
a biomarker to guide the use of those agents. PP2A has diverse functions, including the negative regulation of
numerous oncogenic signaling. Oncogene activation can cause replication stress that could be lethal to the cells.
ATR/CHK1 signaling suppresses replication stress to less toxic levels. Thus, cancer cells with increased
replication stress, such as cancer cells with c-Myc activation/expression, heavily rely on ATR/CHK1 for survival.
Given the role of PP2A in negatively regulating multiple oncogenic pathways, B55 α deficiency may lead to
oncogene activation and replication stress, rendering these cells sensitive to ATR/CHK1 inhibition. We
hypothesize that ATR and CHK1 inhibitors specifically target B55 α-defective HGSOC cells by enhancing
replication stress. Thus, reduced B55 α expression could be a biomarker to guide the use of ATR and CHK1
inhibitors. Three Specific Aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of c-Myc in B55 α deficiency-
induced replication stress. In Aim 2, we will determine the causes of the B55 α deficiency-induced replication
stress. In Aim 3, we will assess the anti-tumor activities of ATR and CHK1 inhibition in targeting B55 α defective
HGSOC cells. If successful, our study will have a significant impact on improving the survival of ovarian cancer
patients by identifying new treatment approaches and by providing a new stratification biomarker for identifying
ATR/CHK1 inhibitor sensitive populations."

In the United States, there are >17,000 new cases of spinal cord injury (SCI) every year, and ~300,000 people
living with chronic SCI. To date, no FDA-approved treatment improves functional recovery. SCI is increasingly
occurring in the aging populations, accompanied by an age-dependent decline in recovery. However, the lack of
studies that incorporate age as a key biological variable has become a major obstacle in translating preclinical
therapies into successfully treating the aging SCI population.
The functional decline of mitochondria associated with normal aging suggests that improving mitochondrial
function following SCI could result in better recovery. However, non-selectively enhancing mitochondria activity
can have divergent effects depending on age and effected cell types, impairing recovery in young mice while
promoting it in older mice. While the cellular and molecular mediators of this age-dependent effect are unknown,
this suggests that more uniform effects may be achieved by targeting the decline in mitochondria function in a
cell specific manner. New data suggest that mitochondrial activity in astrocytes is impaired with age, and that in
vitro reducing mitochondrial activity in young astrocytes increases the injury size, and conversely, activation of
mitochondria reduces the lesion size. This is of high importance because acute astroglial scar formation after
SCI is beneficial, reducing the spread of inflammation and protecting spared neural tissue. Preliminary in vivo
data suggests a reduction in acute astroglial scar formation with age and an increase in inflammation markers
and lesion size, associated with a reduction in functional recovery. Remarkably, pilot data show an age-
dependent changes in molecular pathways involved in astrogliosis including the reduction of STAT3 (signal
transducer and activator of transcription) and increase of PIAS3 (Protein inhibitor of activated STAT3), both
having opposite roles on mitochondrial activities.
Thus, the central hypothesis is that the age-dependent decline in astrocytic mitochondrial functions
impairs astroglial scar formation and reduces functional recovery after SCI with age. This hypothesis will
be tested in three related, but independent, aims:
The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate that promoting mitochondrial activity in astrocytes reduces
lesion size and promotes recovery after SCI in aged animals. These objectives will be achieved by reducing
mitochondrial function in astrocytes in vitro and in vivo, using genetic (Ndufs4flox;Ai14) and pharmacological
strategies (Aim 1), by increasing mitochondrial activity using PGC-1α overexpression in astrocytes and drugs
promoting mitochondrial functions chosen from a new High Content Screen assay (Aim 2), and by establishing
the sub-cellular roles played by STAT3 and PIAS3 in modulating mitochondrial function in astrocytes using in
vitro and in vivo gain and loss of function (transgenic mice STAT3flox, PIAS3flox, SOCS3flox; overexpression of
nuclear or mitochondrial STAT3 and PIAS3) and in vivo transient mRNA expression after SCI (Aim 3)."

Since its inception in 2012, the UJMT Fogarty Global Health Fellows Program—led by the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Johns Hopkins University, Morehouse School of Medicine, and Tulane University—has
provided a critical pathway to global health research careers. Our 252 trainees have collectively secured $88.5
million in grant funding, a nearly 600% return on the NIH’s investment. During the current grant cycle (2017-
present), our 110 doctoral scholars and postdoctoral fellows have published a collective 287 manuscripts,
including 109 as primary author. The vast majority remain involved in global health research and many have
already obtained independent grant funding. In the coming grant cycle (2022-2027), under the new LAUNCH
initiative, we build upon these strengths to further improve and expand our program. First, we will provide
enriching 12-month mentored training opportunities at affiliated research sites in 16 countries. We draw upon a
talented pool of US and international candidates, jointly recruited from 12 domestic and 17 international training
programs funded by the NIH. Our expert mentors support experiential learning on site, while the program
provides a central training framework that monitors progress through individual development plans, core skills
checklists, and regular group check-ins. Over the course of the five-year award, we expect to support at least 60
positions via base funding; in line with the RFA, 60% will be US postdoctoral fellows. Second, we will continue
to foster research in scientific areas identified by in-country stakeholders. This includes topics described in the
RFA (e.g., HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, cancers, mental health, neurologic disorders), as well as
other longstanding priorities within our host countries (e.g., infectious diseases, women’s health, child health,
environmental health). Third, we will enhance our training curriculum. We have developed a new Research
Leadership Academy for Global Health, building upon our team’s experience in global health and leadership,
institutional resources, and collaborations with other US government programs. We also provide individually
guided research methodology training and scientific writing support, using proven approaches. Fourth, we will
increase the participation of underrepresented groups in global health research, by identifying and addressing
barriers, emphasizing diversity in recruitment efforts, fostering diversity during the fellowship year, and
supporting a pipeline of future candidates. Fifth, we will monitor, evaluate, and learn from our activities to
iteratively improve the quality of our trainee experience. We utilize a conceptual framework that considers both
process and performance to ensure that the specific aims of the program are met. Finally, the UJMT LAUNCH
initiative will be led by a team of committed global health researchers—and a broad network of engaged
collaborators, both in the US and abroad—with the expertise and experience to carry out its ambitious aims.
Through this program, we will train a diverse group of productive, independently funded, research leaders who
are prepared to tackle the most pressing global health issues in the years to come."
10872241,"The abundant neuronal protein α-synuclein, which is implicated in neurodegenerative disease, adopts a wide variety of conformational states that contribute to its physiological and pathological activities. We recently used deep mutational scanning to probe the conformation of α-synuclein that drives its toxicity in a cellular model, and surprisingly, we found that this aberrant phenotype is driven by a dynamic, membrane-bound amphiphilic helix, which is also believed to mediate its native physiological role in vesicle trafficking. How does the physiological conformation of α-synuclein contribute to pathology? Our data highlight a critical sequence feature of α-synuclein that we hypothesize mediates both its physiological and pathological interactions with lipid membranes by increasing dynamics of the membrane-bound helix. In this proposal, we will test our hypothesis for the molecular basis of helix dynamics, as well as the contribution of those dynamics to exocytosis and aggregation. In order to test these hypotheses, the principal investigator (PI) requires additional training in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mammalian cell culture and manipulation, and cellular imaging, as well as additional expertise in membrane protein biophysics and the molecular biology of vesicle trafficking and neurotransmission. These hypotheses will therefore be addressed under the mentorship of Prof. William DeGrado, one of the world’s leading experts in membrane protein structure and function, and Prof. Robert Edwards, one of the world’s leading experts on the role of α-synuclein in exocytosis. With their guidance, the PI will (1) test the contribution of α-synuclein sequence features to the dynamics of the membrane bound state using NMR spectroscopy, and (2) test the role of those sequence features in mediating α-synuclein’s effect on exocytosis in neuroendocrine cells. Following completion of the mentored phase, the PI will (3) test the contributions of dynamic membrane binding to α-synuclein aggregation using deep mutational scanning. Together, these aims will provide a molecular mechanism by which the unique structure of α-synuclein contributes to both its physiological and pathological activities. Moreover, the training provided by these experiences will position the PI to launch an independent scientific career examining functional interactions between proteins and lipid membranes, as well as the biophysical and cellular determinants of protein misfolding."
10872242,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Advanced cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) have very poor survival
due to limited effective treatments. Three major obstacles have stalled drug development: 1) the low number of
patients with each T-cell lymphoma (TCL) subtype, which limits sample availability and clinical trial enrollment;
2) genetic and tissue microenvironment variability across subtypes; and 3) a lack of cellular and animal models
to test immunotherapies. Thus, there is a major scientific gap in the development of new treatments for TCL.
Here, we propose the use of an innovative implantable microdevice (MD), smaller than a grain of rice, that is
placed directly into a patient's cancerous lesion to screen drugs and to identify the most effective cancer drug
to treat TCL on a personalized level. Our MD delivers up to 20 drugs of any class into non-overlapping regions
of a tumor. It is delivered into the skin with a small needle and retrieved in 3 days by excising the device along
with a few millimeters of surrounding cancer tissue with a standard skin biopsy tool. This device allows testing
drugs directly inside the living tumor with microdoses, thereby avoiding the risk of systemic side effects. Drug
sensitivity is determined by histologic assessment of the tumor surrounding the device. The MD and the
method for processing and analyzing tissue has been validated across multiple cancer types in mouse models
and is being evaluated in an ongoing pilot study in breast cancer. The specific aims of these studies will be to:
i) determine the safety and feasibility of implanting and retrieving the MD in skin lesions of TCL; ii) assess local
responsiveness of TCL to cancer treatments delivered via the MD through microscopic assessments using
highly multiplexed cyclic immunofluorescence, a novel platform capable of characterizing subcellular changes
in the native immune microenvironment following drug treatment with over 30 markers, and iii) correlate
genetic abnormalities of TCL with drug response to identify potential biomarkers of response and to determine
if the MD can be used to predict clinical response by correlating the local tissue response to drug with a
patient's clinical response to the same drug when given systemically. We hypothesize that in situ tissue
profiling of drugs in TCL can predict systemic responses to standard of care therapies and therefore can serve
as a rapid screen for multiple investigational single or combination treatments. Additionally, genomic and
immunophenotypic analysis of tumors may assist in identification of predictive biomarkers of treatment. The
results of our studies will focus clinical trial efforts toward the most promising treatment strategies and usher in
the era of precision medicine in TCL."

In native tissue, cell recruitment and positioning are controlled by directed migration, where cells sense
multiple guidance cues in their microenvironment and migrate preferentially toward or away from particular
signals. Although several types of guidance or ""taxis"" cues have been identified, the hierarchy between
simultaneously presented signals during directed migration remains poorly understood. Dissecting these
relationships will help enhance our understanding of cell motility in complex environments with broad
implications in therapeutic development to promote or inhibit migratory activity.
To expand our knowledge about the cues that promote directed cell migration, we propose a new experimental
platform that combines microengineered fiber alignment gradients with controlled soluble biochemical
gradients to endothelial, immune, and cancer cell migration within a complex 3D environment. Our platform
will allow us to uniquely expose cell populations to a controlled multi-cue 3D environment containing alignment
gradients and biochemical gradients to dissect how cells prioritize and respond to simultaneous guidance
cues. We hypothesize synergetic (additive) and hierarchal (competitive) relationships between biophysical and
biochemical guidance cues that influence directed cell migration. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out the
following aims: 1) Quantify migration within a microengineered 3D collagen gel environment with tunable
alignment landscapes, 2) Create biochemical gradients and quantify chemotactic responses within 3D gel
environments, and 3) Quantify motility responses within combined biophysical and biochemical gradient
environments.
Success in this project will establish a platform to uniquely study how cells sense, prioritize, and migrate in
response to multiple guidance cues (here, biophysical and biochemical gradients), with relevance to early
development, immune cell trafficking, vascularization, and cancer invasion."
10868957,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 The goal of this project is to characterize and develop the adult kidney of the novel zebrafish-related teleost fish,
Danionella cerebrum, for optical-based kidney disease research. Visualizing cellular interactions within an intact live adult
vertebrate kidney has led to discoveries of dynamic cell behaviors in their natural, unperturbed environment. Currently, the
ability to perform this type of research remains limited to few investigators due to the high bar of entry mainly because of
the costs associated with the sophisticated multiphoton microscopic equipment needed and the training required to perform
complex surgical procedures. D. cerebrum possess many of the same amenable attributes seen in zebrafish, with the added
benefits of adults remaining small and almost completely transparent in adulthood. These later characteristics allow for
optical access to the mature, yet small mesonephric kidney of this species, ideal for optical-based studies using standard
confocal techniques with no need for surgical interventions. Our recently published methods using custom 3D-printed
chambers allow for prolonged and longitudinal imaging of the same adult fish over long periods of time.
 We have generated several kidney and innate immune cell-specific transgenic D. cerebrum lines for this project. In
Aim 1, we will establish and standardize methods of inducing kidney injury in adult D. cerebrum using nephrotoxic
chemical agents and laser ablation approaches. In vivo imaging of labeled kidney-specific cells combined with a
fluorescence-based functional assay will allow us to observe and quantify the degree of renal damage. Traditional
histological analyses will confirm and corroborate our imaging data. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate the utility of this new
animal model by using imaging techniques to explore and characterize the innate immune system’s role in kidney injury
and recovery. Combining new and available transgenic lines will allow us to explore the signaling mechanisms that regulate
the innate immune response to kidney injury and determine what role innate immune cells play in kidney cell recovery and
regeneration, or conversely, fibrosis and scar formation. This proposed study will provide the foundation for future kidney-
related investigations. This model will facilitate important discoveries in the biology of kidney disease and have the potential
to transform kidney research by providing a highly optically accessible and genetically tractable whole animal model
system."

 Cells are dynamic, multiscale materials. Their ability to sense and respond to a wide variety of stimuli is
predicated on the hierarchical construction of the actin cytoskeleton, where individual actin monomers assemble
to form filaments, which themselves assemble to form more complicated structures. Therefore, to engineer nano-
bio interfaces that can stimulate a specific cellular response, we propose to test a biomimetic approach, where
our designer material will exhibit hierarchy and function across the same length scales as the cytoskeleton. This
project aims to engineer arrays of spiky gold nanoparticles with spike characteristics that are commensurate with
actin filaments and where the particle-particle spacing corresponds to the size of mature focal adhesions. Our
fabrication method is biocompatible, high-resolution, and high-throughput. We will investigate the physical effects
of topographical features across length scales as well as chemical effects. Since the smallest feature size of the
spiky nanoparticles (the tips) have radii of curvature tunable in the 5-10 nm range, we can test whether known
nanotopographical sensing pathways occur at length scales similar in size to single proteins as well as the effects
on cell phenotype resulting from reduced focal adhesion density. We will evaluate for synergistic effects between
nano- and microscale topographical sensing on contact guidance of the cytoskeleton by comparing responses
from different spike and nanoparticle array geometries.
 As a model problem, we aim to manipulate the process of macropinocytosis. While nanoscale curvature is
known to promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the effects of curvature on macropinocytosis remain unclear.
By varying the spike features of the nanoparticles and the DNA-aptamer functionalization of their surfaces, we
will test for synergy between two factors: (1) enhanced rates of macropinocytosis via receptor binding to the DNA
ligands; and (2) effects of priming the cell membrane for macropinocytosis through nanotopographical curvature.
We expect that our biomimetic approach enabled by spiky nanoparticle arrays will have a significant impact on
a range of questions in biotechnology, from fundamental mechanisms for early-stage endocytosis to applications
such as biofouling-resistant sensors and the use of topographical cues as mechanobiological stimuli."

 The thematic focus of the UAB Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC) is Deep South disparities in
dementia. Individuals born in the Deep South (traditionally defined as the five-state region spanning LA, MS,
AL, GA, and SC) have high rates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) relative to other
regions. Contributing to this, the region is enriched with groups disparately impacted by dementia due to
factors associated with race, adverse social determinants of health (SDOH), chronic health conditions, and
other issues. The region is home to the nation’s largest population identifying as Black or African American,
who are estimated to be at as much as double the risk of AD.
 Our vision is a future in which these Deep South disparities in AD are eliminated. Realizing this vision
requires a deeper understanding of how this unique amalgamation of factors drives higher rates of dementia,
which is at the heart of our plans. As a P20 Exploratory Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC), we
have established the teams, programs, and infrastructure to pursue this theme, and have exceeded our
recruitment goals with a cohort that is 47% Black/African American. Here we propose building on this initial
track record of success with a P30 ADRC that will advance our long-term vision of reducing dementia in the
Deep South by eliminating these disparities, by (1) providing coordinated infrastructure leveraging UAB’s
strengths to answer questions necessary to reduce Deep South disparities in dementia; (2) recruiting a cohort
that reflects the unique and diverse population of the Deep South; (3) collecting a broad dataset from ADRC
participants that informs about potential bases for Deep South disparities in ADRD, including clinical, SDOH,
activity/sleep, genetic, and biomarker data; (4) collecting and distributing biospecimens from participants in a
unique Deep South cohort; (5) increasing diversity in national ADRD initiatives; (6) fostering innovative and
impactful ADRD research, especially projects addressing Deep South disparities in dementia; (7) attracting and
training the next generation of ADRD researchers; and (8) serving our community, increasing awareness of
ADRD both among the public and at UAB."

The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is thought to play a central role in reward-based learning. The leading
theory posits that DA release acts as a reward prediction error (RPE) which incrementally updates the brain’s
predictions about future rewards. Recently, however, this hypothesis has come under attack, with two distinct
alternatives suggested related to learning rate and retrospective inference. However, these models make
similar predictions for patterns of DA release in standard classical conditioning tasks, making them difficult to
separate. Additionally, these studies, as well as some supporting RPE, suffer from several caveats: (1)
Rewards generate movements, which confound the interpretation of neural signals related to learning; (2)
Rewards activate many learning systems in parallel, not just the DA system, limiting the ability to attribute
learning to DA itself; (3) DA neurons have diverse functions that depend on their projection target, but prior
studies often mixed these diverse populations when recording or stimulating DA neurons. Thus, the
algorithm(s) by which DA drives reward learning and how this may be implemented in neural circuits remain
unknown. The central idea of this proposal is to use artificial conditioning tasks in which natural rewards have
been replaced with calibrated optical stimulation of dopamine axons (cDAS) in specific striatal subregions in
head-fixed mice. By design, this approach (1) limits movements, (2) isolates the effect DA release itself, and
(3) targets a projection-specific population of DA neurons, thus limiting caveats that hindered prior studies. Aim
1 uses this approach to identify the algorithm of DA-driven learning within the lateral nucleus accumbens
(lNAc), a site with concentrated signatures of RPE in DA release. Artificial conditioning tasks were designed to
arbitrate between RPE and alternative models. Preliminary data suggest that cDAS in lNAc generates changes
in DA activity that are consistent with RPE but not alternatives. In Aim 2, cell type-specific electrophysiological
recording and optical stimulation in lNAc will be used to answer how DA release alters striatal activity to drive
RPE learning. Aim 3 expands these studies to the dorsal striatum (DS), where DA release is thought to shape
and reinforce movements during addiction and other forms of habit formation. Multisite cDAS and projection-
specific optotagging of DA neurons will be combined with cutting-edge video processing techniques to test the
hypothesis that DA-driven learning spreads from lNAc to DS to shape movements (an “actor-critic” model).
Together, these reductionist studies will enable the algorithmic and neural circuit basis of DA-driven learning in
the striatum to be dissected with unprecedented precision. The proposed research will be conducted in the
Uchida Lab at Harvard, an excellent environment with all the necessary resources at hand. The candidate has
assembled an expert advisory committee and has made detailed plans to acquire the additional technical and
professional skills needed to complete the proposed project and launch his successful transition to an
independent research career."
10865394,"Veterans with bipolar disorders (BD) experience recurrent and seemingly unpredictable periods of severe
impairments in psychosocial functioning, such as participation in social roles and activities. Many effective
treatments for BD emphasize early detection of bipolar episodes, in order to make necessary treatment
adjustments and prevent psychosocial impairments associated with acute mood episodes. Unfortunately, acute
mood episodes in BD are also associated with a decrease in a patient’s insight into their own symptoms, which
can prevent one’s ability to self-report first signs of symptoms and functional declines. Moreover, routine care
visits for BD are typically too infrequent to capture and effectively monitor day-to-day changes in a patient’s mood
and functioning.
 Objective, low-effort, and continuous methods of tracking symptoms and social participation of Veterans
with BD in real-time and in-situ are needed to provide early (i.e., days in advance) warning signs of acute bipolar
episodes and functional declines, which in turn would enable well-timed interventions to prevent poor
psychosocial outcomes. mHealth refers to the use of mobile and wireless devices as part of patient care and
offers many potential opportunities for early detection of and intervention for acute mood states in this population.
However, these mHealth approaches have not been investigated in Veterans with BD. In a Small Projects in
Rehabilitation Research (SPiRE)-funded pilot study, our investigator team established high feasibility and
acceptability of one such innovative passive mHealth approach using a smartphone program, or an app, in a
small sample of Veterans with BD to track their smartphone’s GPS/location. The pilot study used a priori location
context ratings of visited places (e.g., a priori ratings on types of activities usually engaged in at a frequently
visited location) to derive unobtrusive measures of social participation (e.g., time spent at work-related locations).
The goal of this Merit Review proposal is to establish reliable and valid machine-learning algorithms using the
same types of mHealth data to prospectively (days in advance) detect declines in social participation and
prospective onset of mania and depression in Veterans with BD. This proposal has three aims:
 Aim 1. To establish a machine learning algorithm using GPS/location data for predicting prospective
declines in social participation in Veterans with BD.
 Aim 2. To establish machine learning algorithms using GPS/location data for predicting prospective acute
BD clinical states. We will explore whether adding more burdensome daily self-report and voice diaries’ speech
analysis features improves our models’ precision using statistical indices of prediction precision or accuracy.
 Aim 3. To explore clinical implementation of the mHealth-based algorithms in treatment of BD. Focus
groups of VA providers and administrators will assess feasibility of algorithms’ implementation in clinical care.
 Aims 1 and 2 will be accomplished using a smartphone app that continuously and passively monitors
location/GPS data, along with a daily self-report of mood/symptoms and daily voice diaries using separate apps,
to predict bipolar symptoms and social participation assessed during biweekly videoconference interviews in a
sample of 200 Veterans with BD receiving care at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System. mHealth data from
days prior to the biweekly interviews will be used as features in a small number of candidate machine learning
models (e.g., Random Forest, Lasso, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine) with outcome measures being
biweekly interview assessments of bipolar symptoms and social participation. The machine learning models
were chosen to be complementary for being parametric versus non-parametric, linear versus non-linear, and of
varying degrees of flexibility and model complexity. For Aim 3, two focus groups—one of 8 VA mental health
providers and one of 8 VA administrators—representing diverse disciplines will use guided discussion questions
to elicit feedback about implementation of mHealth-based algorithms in future clinical care of Veterans with BD."

Two large macromolecular machines, the spindle and kinetochore, coordinate chromosome segregation at cell
division. Errors in their function can lead to cancer and birth defects. While we now know nearly all the
molecules required for mammalian spindle and kinetochore function, how they collectively give rise to these
machines’ emergent physical properties remains poorly understood. Our long-term goal is to uncover the basic
physical design principles of robust and accurate mammalian chromosome segregation. How do thousands of
nm-scale molecules, pushing and pulling, give rise to the spindle’s m-scale steady-state architecture and
mechanics? How do hundreds of kinetochore molecules work together to ‘compute’ attachment signals for
decision-making, and to robustly grip microtubules? This knowledge gap persists because we cannot currently
reconstitute these machines in vitro, and lack tools in vivo. To close this gap, we need approaches to finely
control molecules and directly exert forces inside dividing mammalian cells – which we recently developed.
 First, we aim to define the mechanisms and functions of the spindle’s emergent architecture and

required to give it a steady-state structure, but are instead required to give it mechanical and functional
stability. Further, we will define in vivo and in vitro how active and passive forces contribute to building a
steady-state spindle. (ii) To uncover the function of the spindle’s specific steady-state shape, we developed an
optogenetic approach to acutely and locally control spindle architecture. We will use it to test the role of given
architectural modules in space and time through mitosis. (iii) To define the mechanisms underlying the steady-
state spindle’s mechanical robustness, we will use microneedle manipulation to deform the spindle, which we
recently adapted in mammalian cells, and modeling. Second, we aim to define how the kinetochore’s
molecules together enable it to ‘compute' attachment information and robustly grip microtubules. (i) Based on
our recent finding that only a few bound microtubules are needed for a kinetochore to allow anaphase, we will
quantitatively rewire kinetochore composition to test models for the origin of this exquisite microtubule
sensitivity. (ii) Using biophysical approaches we developed to remove and exert forces on kinetochores in vivo,
we will define the mechanisms giving rise to the kinetochore’s specialized, strong and dynamic grip.
 Together, this will provide a framework for understanding, targeting, and rewiring the physical
processes of chromosome segregation for both basic and therapeutic purposes. This proposal is innovative in
that it tests new hypotheses about the connection between molecular and cellular-scale events, and provides
new tools for rewiring molecular-scale forces and assemblies and directly probing mechanics inside dividing

 Targeting polarity proteins to mutually exclusive plasma membrane (PM) domains is an essential
process for establishing and maintaining cell polarity – a process that is regulated by an ever-expanding
interaction network among polarity proteins and their regulators/effectors. In contrast, much less is known
about how physical interactions between polarity proteins and the PM contribute to this polarization process.
Recent research from the PI’s lab showed that multiple core polarity proteins (“polybasic polarity proteins”)
such as Lgl, aPKC, and Dlg are also inherently membrane-binding proteins. They contain so-called polybasic
domains that specifically and electrostatically target to the PM by binding to PM phospholipids such as PI4P
and PIP2. We have characterized multiple mechanisms that control the polarized electrostatic PM targeting
function of polybasic polarity proteins. We have also discovered an unexpected consequence of such widely
existing electrostatic PM targeting in cell polarity: PM localization of polybasic polarity proteins is highly
susceptible to energetic stresses triggered by hypoxia and ATP inhibition, which induce dynamic turnover of
PM PI4P and PIP2. In this proposal, our goal is to further establish electrostatic PM-targeting as a fundamental
mechanism regulating cell polarity under both normal and energetic stressed conditions. Specifically, we will
investigate:
 1) Diverse mechanisms regulating electrostatic PM targeting in cell polarity. We will focus on the
regulation of electrostatic PM targeting of basolateral polarity protein Dlg which is controlled by
phosphorylation, allosteric regulation of its polybasic domain, and interactions with other basolateral polarity
proteins. We will elucidate how allosteric regulation of electrostatic PM targeting acts as a core mechanism by
which basolateral polarity proteins control each other’s localization and functions.
 2) Control of aPKC phosphorylation by electrostatic PM targeting. aPKC is the key kinase driving cell
polarization and its pseudo-substrate region (PSr) is also a polybasic domain that is allosterically controlled by
Par-6 for both PM targeting and kinase activity. Using a novel inducible polarization system, we will investigate
the hypothesis that Par-6-dependent electrostatic PM targeting of aPKC controls the substrate-specific
phosphorylation of aPKC/Par-6, providing a mechanism of spatiotemporal control of aPKC kinase activity in
cell polarization.
3) Regulation of electrostatic PM retargeting of polybasic polarity proteins. Despite total loss of the PM
targeting function of Lgl and aPKC under hypoxia due to depletion of PM PI4P and PIP2, we found that both
proteins always directly retargeted their original basolateral or apical PM domains once reoxygenation started.
We will investigate both lipid- and protein-based mechanisms that restore and control such polarized PM
retargeting of polybasic polarity proteins. These mechanisms will be critical to our understanding of how cell
polarity survives energetic stress conditions such as hypoxia and ischemia.
 Our proposed research will delineate essential molecular details that integrate electrostatic PM
targeting into the regulatory network of polarity proteins and phospholipids. Discovering novel mechanisms
regulating electrostatic PM targeting will be fundamental to our knowledge on cell polarity under both normal
and stress conditions."

Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated inflammation initiates physiological immune responses; however,
inappropriate TLR activity leads to immune pathology as observed in inflammatory diseases, such as systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE). Various proteins acting in the TLR pathway, such as the Src kinase LYN and the
transcription factor IRF5, are genetically linked to SLE. Related mouse models confirm their critical roles. LYN-
deficient mice develop a spontaneous lupus-like disease that is rescued by genetic deletion of IRF5 or the up-
stream acting TLR adaptor protein MyD88. As such, LYN is an important negative regulatory protein, while IRF5
promotes lupus inflammation. Still, the molecular mechanisms acting between TLR/ MyD88, LYN and IRF5 are
incompletely understood. In preliminary studies, we found that MyD88 controls LYN activity via a sequence of
defined protein interactions, which inhibit LYN during TLR stimulation and thus allow for IRF5 activation.
Accordingly, point mutations of key interacting surfaces in cell lines results in uncontrolled LYN activity and
inhibition of IRF5 activation. This mechanism is coupled with tyrosine phosphorylation events between MyD88,
LYN and IRF5 and a hitherto undefined E3 ubiquitin ligase that controls pathway activity. Based on these
observations we hypothesize that this mechanism is essential to maintain the balance between TLR-driven
physiological and pathological inflammation. While these observations are based on extensive biochemical
analyses, they raise important questions as to (i) the in vivo relevance of this pathway, in particular for lupus-like
inflammatory disease and possible therapeutic implications and (ii) the mechanism of IRF5 regulation, in
particular related to the unknown IRF5 E3 ligase.
 In this project, we will investigate three novel knock-in (KI) mice with defined point mutations controlling
mentioned protein interactions. If our hypothesis is correct, two of these point mutations (acting upstream of
LYN) will prevent TLR-driven lupus-like disease in mouse models due to inhibition of IRF5, while one mutation
(acting downstream of LYN) is expected to mediate an IRF5 gain-of-function phenotype and thus drive lupus
pathology. We will use a biochemical approach based on quantitative mass spectrometry to identify the
mentioned, hitherto undefined E3 ligase.
 Collectively, we expect that this work will establish the described protein interaction and phosphorylation
cascade as key TLR-regulatory mechanism. Given the central function of TLRs and IRFs in many physiological
and pathological conditions, we expect that the significance of results obtained in this project reaches beyond
IRF5 and lupus biology."

The dominant source of calories in the American diet is now ultra-processed (UP) foods that are composed of
mostly cheap industrial sources of dietary energy and nutrients plus additives. UP foods are capable of
triggering addictive-like changes in the brain and are strongly associated with indicators of substance use
disorders (SUD), including an escalating, compulsive pattern of intake that occurs despite negative
consequences. The ability of UP foods to trigger withdrawal has received little study in humans, despite
compelling animal model evidence. Withdrawal in SUD is marked by the emergence of aversive physical,
cognitive and affective symptoms and increased motivational salience of substance-related cues during
abstinence in chronic users. If UP foods are capable of triggering a similar response, aversive withdrawal
symptoms and increased motivational salience to UP food cues may be a significant obstacle to dietary
change and a novel intervention target. Investigating whether reducing UP food intake results in withdrawal
could also inform the ongoing scientific debate of whether UP foods are addictive, which has important
theoretical and practical implications. Our overall objectives in this application are to determine whether a
reduction in UP food intake: 1) causes withdrawal symptoms, and 2) increases the motivational salience of UP
food cues and, if so, whether these factors undermine maintenance of a low-UP diet. We will achieve our
objectives by testing the following specific aims using a within-subject design in 200 high-risk individuals:
Aim 1: To investigate whether aversive physical, cognitive, and affective withdrawal symptoms emerge
in response to reduced UP food intake compared to a calorically equivalent high-UP diet, and whether
this predicts failure to maintain a low-UP diet. H1a: Reducing UP food intake will result in aversive physical,
cognitive, and affective withdrawal symptoms, as indicated by 1) Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
reports of aversive withdrawal symptoms, and 2) heart rate reactivity and subjective distress to an in-lab
stressor. H1b: Aversive symptoms of UP food withdrawal will predict greater UP food intake and higher blood
glucose levels during dietary maintenance.
Aim 2: To investigate whether increased motivational salience of UP food cues emerges in response to
reduced UP food intake, and whether this predicts failure to maintain a low-UP diet. H2a: Reducing UP
food intake will result in increased motivational salience of UP food cues, as indicated by 1) EMA reports of UP
food craving, 2) heart rate reactivity and subjective craving in a simulated fast-food restaurant, 3) attentional
biases for UP foods, and 4) greater reward-related neural response to UP food cues. H2b: Increased
motivational salience of UP food cues will predict greater UP food intake and higher blood glucose levels
during dietary maintenance."

Primary cilia play a pivotal role in human health, acting as signaling hubs to sense extracellular cues such as
odorants, metabolites, light, neurotransmitters, and more. Defects or failure of these signaling hubs to function
leads to developmental disorders, immune dysfunction, diabetes, obesity, Parkinson’s disease, cancer, and other
pathologies. An early focus of this grant is the generation of better tools to dissect primary cilia function and
mechanism, such as a protocol for synchronized ciliogenesis in human retinal pigemented epithelial (RPE) cells
coupled with microscopy and shotgun/phosphoproteomic mass spectrometry, to dissect signaling events
temporally and spatially. While mapping ciliogenesis via immunofluorescence with known markers of the stages,
one protein that emerged as a strong candidate for regulating interpathway communication was TULP3, a 50kDa
ciliary protein whose primary known function is in driving the import of ciliary GPCRs through unclear
mechanisms. A combination of synchronization and classical cell biological approaches were used to uncover
novel phenotypes revealing temporal and spatial timing of TULP3’s function in GPCR traffic as well as new
functions in ciliogenesis, downstream of TTBK2 recruitment but before axoneme protrusion. Patient mutations
were identified from the use of GWAS databases to probe for links between protein function and human health.
Constitutive expression of these TULP3 mutants in TULP3 KO background generated new tools to perturb select
functions for TULP3, which is especially powerful for probing function-specific binding domains and partners.
This proposal tests the following hypotheses: TULP3 (i) regulates receptor traffic prior to cargo arrival at the
basal body and coupling to IFT machinery to mediate receptor entry into cilia and (ii) licenses axonemogenesis.
Furthermore, primary cilia perform two different functions in lymphoid tissues: regulating fate change of
hematopoietic stem cells into lymphocytes in the bone marrow, and in the lymph node facilitating lymphocyte
maturation. These hypotheses will be tested in the following aims: Aim 1- Determine the mechanism by which
TULP3 mediates membrane receptor transport into cilia. Aim 2- Identify the function and mechanism of TULP3
in ciliogenesis. Aim 3- Uncover the function of primary cilia and TULP3 in the generation of white blood cells.
These aims will be addressed using cell culture and mouse model systems to probe TULP3 function and its role
in immunity in both in vitro and in vivo contexts. The success of any and all of these aims will provide novel
insight into key mechanisms driving ciliary function and reveal cellular contexts for how disrupted immune
function arises. The study of primary cilia in the lymphatic system is largely uncharted territory. As a result, these
studies are expected to open new fields of investigation into mechanisms of immune regulation."

to address Deep South disparities in dementia by training a diverse group of future leaders engaged in ADRD
research. The REC will leverage significant infrastructure already in place at UAB, including collaborations with
the Deep South Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR), to achieve goals related to our focus
on Deep South disparities in dementia. The purpose of the UAB ADRC REC is to build research capacity on
Deep South disparities in dementia. We will expand the ADRD workforce by mentoring a diverse group of
scholars with the necessary intellectual and technical competences to bring together basic science and clinical
collaborations that will improve the lives of dementia patients. Launching Excellent Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Scholars (LEADRS) is our REC Scholars program and has two parallel pathways. The REC Trainee
track includes graduate students and early postdocs and the REC Investigator track includes late-stage
postdocs and junior faculty. Support provided to each is different and specific to the needs of the two groups.
We will develop a broad-based curriculum to support engagement with the UAB ADRC and REC scholars and
provide mentorship and research navigation to UAB investigators new to ADRD. The impact of the REC on the
UAB ADRC will be measured yearly, by the quality and impact of the research conducted by affiliated trainees
and the overall potential impact their research has on society. The major thematic goals of the UAB REC are to
increase diversity, collaborate to support trainees and scholars, and offer an array of programming that

DNA is generally thought of as stable. However, retrotransposons are mobile elements that result in new copy

The long-term goal of this proposal is to provide enhanced training that will enable the applicant to establish
novel mechanisms by which reward circuitry is affected. Aims in this proposal will test the extent to which the
retrotransposon, long-interspersed element 1 (L1) is impacted by environmental conditions and the impact on
behavior related to substance use disorder (SUD) in adulthood. In the K99 phase, Aim1 will utilize innovative
molecular-genetic approaches to determine where de novo L1 insertions reside within the basolateral amygdala
(BLA) due to early life adversity (ELA). Aim 2 will utilize magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) to determine
whether de novo L1 insertions reside within a particular cell type. In the R00 independent phase, the applicant
will leverage this training to advance a research program that expands to studying L1 throughout development
and the impact on morphine self-administration. The innovative approach of this proposal comes from the
intersection of technical and conceptual advances in molecular biology, behavioral neuroendocrinology, and
addiction neuroscience. Expanding basic knowledge of mechanisms by which the reward pathway is impacted
can provide a critical foundation for future design of treatments for substance use disorder and other

Within each cell, a robust molecular clock is established by transcription-translation feedback loops driven by
the transcriptional activation complex CLOCK:BMAL1 and the repressors PER (period) and CRY (cryptochrome)
that turn CLOCK:BMAL1 “off”. The molecular clock controls daily oscillations in the expression of over 40% of
the genome to synchronize host physiology with the external environment. These oscillations are self-sustaining
on the cellular level: circadian rhythms persist with similar timing even when all external cues are removed, but
will align with external cues when present, a feature called entrainment. In mammals, induction of the circadian
repressor PER is a universal first step in the entrainment. Microbes are ubiquitous in our environment and
undergo daily fluctuations correlated with the 24-hour solar cycle, but it is not known how microbial exposure
impacts circadian rhythms. This research will explore how microbial concentration affects cellular signaling
cascades responsible for entrainment and will define novel innate regulators of the clock. In addition, these
studies will leverage the genetic and experimental tractability of zebrafish to perform high throughput, real time
kinetics of circadian responses in vivo. The ability to do whole body, non-invasive imaging in zebrafish has
significant advantages over established murine models and is particularly advantageous for migratory
populations such as immune cells. Furthermore, as a non-mammalian, cold-blooded vertebrate, the study of
clocks in zebrafish also represents an incredible opportunity to bridge the evolutionary gap between the most
well characterized animal systems: Drosophila (invertebrate) and mice (vertebrate, mammal). Together, this
research will advance our fundamental understanding of vertebrate circadian clocks and how it integrates
information about microbial stimulation to entrain cellular clocks at the molecular level."

 Diabetes is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD). When combined, diabetes with CKD
exponentially increases risk for cardiovascular disease and death. Preventing or delaying CKD in diabetes would
substantially decrease these adverse outcomes, save billions in healthcare expenditures, and improve quality of
life for those at high-risk for dialysis-dependent kidney failure. Emerging evidence strongly indicates that primary
aldosteronism (PA) pathophysiology is a causative mechanism for the development and progression of CKD in
diabetes. PA pathophysiology is characterized by relatively non-suppressible and renin-independent aldosterone
production that causes excessive activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). This maladaptive activation
of the MR induces inflammation and fibrosis that contributes to CKD and cardiovascular disease.
 Our work in R01DK115392 has re-defined primary aldosteronism. We have shown that PA
pathophysiology exists across a broad continuum of severity, from mild (or subclinical) to overt (or severe); in
this regard, PA is better considered to be a pathophysiologic syndrome. The prevalence of PA pathophysiology
is high and almost entirely unrecognized. Our work, and that of others, has demonstrated that PA
pathophysiology can be detected in 10-25% of the general population; however, despite this alarming
prevalence, the rates of testing for PA, or empiric MR antagonist use, in these high-risk populations is abysmal
and rarely exceeds 2%. The scope of this problem is magnified by the fact that randomized clinical trials in
patients with diabetes have established the exceptional efficacy of MR antagonists for reducing albuminuria,
lowering the risk of CKD progression, incident end-stage kidney disease, and incident cardiovascular outcomes.
Despite demonstrating this efficacy, these landmark trials did not investigate the role of PA pathophysiology. Our
results from R01DK115392 represent the most likely hypothesis to explain the reno-protective benefits of MR
antagonists: there is a prevalent, progressive, and unrecognized, spectrum of PA pathophysiology and MR
activation in people with diabetes that increase their risk for CKD.
 In this renewal, we will extend our work in R01DK115392 by conducting a mechanistic cohort study to
deeply characterize PA pathophysiology and MR activation in individuals with diabetes and at-risk for incident or
progressive CKD. A thorough understanding of PA pathophysiology as an early mechanistic contributor to CKD
in diabetes will provide critical evidence to support broader use of MR antagonists to prevent CKD development
and progression in diabetes. Participants with diabetes and CKD3A, or at high-risk for developing CKD, will
undergo characterization of PA pathophysiology using profiling of steroids indicative of dysregulated aldosterone
synthase activity, measurement of urinary extracellular vesicles containing proteins indicative of pathology MR
activation, and large-scale unbiased proteomics to explore biomarkers of fibrosis and aldosterone-MR
interactions. Participants will be followed, and measures repeated longitudinally, for 3 years."

The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected African Americans (AA), causing high rates of severe
disease and deaths. Sickle cell disease (SCD), a life-threatening disorder primarily affecting AA (1 in 365 AA), has
magnified the impact of COVID-19 on AA community. Prior research is on COVID-19 in SCD people is limited by
small sample size, heterogeneity in study designs, and data quality issues questioning their generalizability.
Majority of these studies were temporally done during the early phase of pandemic and were focused on
evaluating the associations of clinical risk factors with adverse outcomes. These studies did not evaluate the impact
of social risk factors (social vulnerability indicators, rural location, social determinants of health) and the secular
trends in pandemic (viral variants, vaccines, antiviral therapies). Therefore, the true extent to which SCD is a
biological risk-factor for COVID-19 severity and how it interacts with other known biological and social risk factors
for COVID-19 remains unclear. Furthermore, the prevalence and morbidity caused by the long-COVID, the post-
acute sequalae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), is unknown in SCD population. Proposed study will address these
knowledge gaps using a data-driven strategy. The main objective is to characterize the epidemiology and
outcomes of COVID-19 in SCD patients using NIH initiated National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a
harmonized EHR repository. This registry is representative of US population with ~40 million patients [SCD
patients, 15,169; COVID positive SCD patients, 4,143]. Aim 1 will determine the biological and social risk factors
for adverse outcomes of COVID-19 in people with SCD. Sub-aim 1a will quantify the relative risk of COVID-19
adverse outcomes (severe COVID-19 and mortality) between propensity score (PS) matched cohorts of SCD and
non-SCD patients and clarify if SCD is a biologic risk factor. To identify the key biological or social risk factors for
adverse outcomes multivariate analyses will be performed. In Sub-aim 1b, will identify biological and social risk
factors of adverse outcome in SCD patients. These analyses will be limited to SCD cohort with COVID-19. Advanced
statistical methods have been employed to overcome the weaknesses inherent to usage of registry data (e.g.,
coding errors, missing data etc.). The exploratory aim, Aim 2, will characterize the subphenotypes of long COVID
in the AA with SCD and determine if differences exist compared to the general population. This aim will use
existing machine learning methods available with N3C to identify the clusters of long-COVID using Human
Phenotype Ontology-encoded EHR data. These analyses will identify clinical characteristics of the sub-phenotype
clusters or groups of long-COVID in AA with SCD and compare it with general population. Upon completion, our
study will provide real-world data to guide both clinical practice and public policymaking for preventing and
managing severe COVID-19 in SCD people. Future studies will focus on identifying the predictors of developing
long COVID and understand how it affects SCD comorbidity. Collectively, these discoveries will improve health
equity and management of acute COVID-19, now and endemic disease, and long COVID in SCD population."
10871560,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Social determinants of health are known to have a significant impact on patient outcomes. However,
controversies exist on how to best capture this information in routine care. Most SDH information is captured in
the form of a survey or unstructured free text or narrative and not regularly captured or screened for variety of
factors (e.g., time constraints, clinician experience/comfort in asking, patient fears of sharing potentially
stigmatizing information. This is a particularly rich and robust source of information, especially when trying to
identify patients' goals of care, preferences, or behavioral/social challenges that may exist. In this proposal, we
use natural language processing and generative AI models to capture SDH information from patients. We will
then process this information into discrete data elements that can then be passed into the EHR and acted upon
by clinical decision support system. We will pilot this intervention in a large academic medical center that
provides care to an at-risk patient population and community."
10871157,"Title: Functional state of CD8+ T cell immunity in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
Abstract
Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a fatal disease of malignant CD4+ T cells that develops in human T-
lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1) carriers. Recent studies from our group and others further suggest that ATLL
diagnosed in the Caribbean region and North America (NA-ATLL) differ from those diagnosed in Japan (J-ATLL)
in both clinical presentation and immuno-genetic landscape. More than half of NA-ATLL patients in the U.S. are
immigrants of Caribbean descents. Relative to J-ATLL, NA-ATLL cases are diagnosed at a younger age but
present a more aggressive disease and face a shorter overall survival. Thus, improved understanding of
pathogenesis and novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.
It is well-known that anti-HTLV-1 immune surveillance plays a key role in preventing ATLL development. Multiple
lines of evidence support the notion that ATLL cells achieve immune escape not only by preventing antigen
presentation but also by suppressing systemic immune responses in the hosts. Hence, conceptually, therapies
that aim to augment anti-ATLL cytotoxic T cell response (CTL) should have therapeutic benefit. Currently, ATLL
is often managed with first-line chemotherapy which rarely achieves durable response in NA-ATLL and possibly
further damages already weakened CTL activity in the hosts. At the same time, multiple targeted therapies only
produced limited clinical efficacy. Most remarkably, two immune-modulating treatments, i.e. the anti-CCR4 mAb
mogalizumab and anti-PD-1 mAb Nivolumab, have failed in NA-ATLLs while showing some clinical benefits
among Japanese patients, highlighting the need to obtain an in-depth understanding of the host immune function
in NA-ATLL.
We recently developed a high dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel to achieve in-depth characterization of
both transformed and non-transformed T, B, and NK cells in PBMC samples from our Montefiore-Einstein ATLL
Biobank. We revealed that ATLL cells exhibited a phenotype associated with robust immunosuppression. We
also discovered in these patients a unique population of phenotypically exhausted CD8+ T cells, the proportion
of which decreased in a remission patient. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that ATLL cells induce a
general state of immunosuppression in patients that prevents an effective and durable anti-ATLL effector CD8+
T cell response. Using patient samples from our unique ATLL Biobank and those collected from the
Belinostat/Zidovudine/IFN trial conducted by Dr. Ramos (University of Miami), we will define new immune
correlates of favorable outcomes in this devastating blood cancer though high dimensional flow cytometry,
functional T cell assays, as well as single cell transcriptomic and T cell receptor clonotypic analyses."
10871211,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a top-ten leading cause of death in Americans, aged 25-64, and ethnic minorities.
Individuals with CLD suffer from lower health-related quality of life (HRQOL), disability and place a burden on
their family caregivers. As individuals progress to end-stage liver disease, health-care utilization (HCU) increases
exponentially, largely due to inpatient care for acute decompensations. In certain clinical scenarios, after the
initial 24-48 hour period, the remaining hospital days are often used to meet lower acuity needs such as
continued administration of IV medications, titration of medications and/or daily lab monitoring prior to transition
to outpatient care. This latter period reflects an opportunity to improve HCU in CLD patients by addressing unmet
needs within the home environment, reducing hospitalization-related complications, refining the transition to
outpatient care, and increasing the healthcare system’s capacity by shortening the length of initial
hospitalizations and reducing rehospitalizations. Hospital at Home (H@H) is an emerging model of home-based
care, designed to extend traditional, inpatient hospital care which may address these needs. Through H@H,
acute medical care services as well as ancillary care such as rehabilitation therapy can be delivered in the home.
Prior studies have reported success with implementing this model in terms of clinical and economic efficacy as
well as feasibility. Importantly, the model demonstrated greater satisfaction with care from patients, their family
members, and their providers. Since November 2020, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has provided
a waiver for H@H services in response to the public health emergency resulting in a sudden rise in the
prevalence of H@H programs around the country. As an early adopter, Indiana University Health (IUH)
introduced a H@H program to increase hospital capacity. The model at IUH successfully managed patients with
moderate COVID-19 infection, leading to an expansion in 2022 to include management of common infections
and heart failure. As a next step in expansion, the IUH H@H team is partnering with PI and the IUH Hepatology
team to manage select patients with CLD. The overall goal of this proposal is to assess whether IUH’s H@H
program represents a novel care delivery model in cirrhosis that is safe, improves patient and caregiver
experience as well as reduces HCU in the high-risk, CLD population. To achieve this goal, we propose a pilot,
prospective observational study of 30 individuals who receive care for their liver disease-related admission
through IUH’s H@H program with two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 is to assess the (1) feasibility, (2) safety, (3)
patient reported outcomes and (4) impact on healthcare utilization associated with expanding IUH’s H@H
program in the CLD population. Specific Aim 2 is to determine patient and caregiver acceptability of completing
care of acute exacerbations of CLD using IUH’s H@H program and elicit patient- and caregiver-centric revisions
of the H@H program using human-centered design methodology."

The goal of this R03 is to leverage computational linguistics to identify sensitive, efficient, and scalable measures
of social communication that can be used to inform intervention efforts for transition-aged youth on the autism
spectrum. Such measures would yield significant benefits for both (a) quantifying post-intervention clinical
outcome and (b) precision tailoring for future interventions. By applying sophisticated computational linguistic
approaches specifically designed to assess social communication in autistic youth (developed by MPI Parish-
Morris and Co-I Cho) to a rich pre-existing dataset from a completed RCT of the START intervention model
(extracted from 421 video-recorded conversations from 35 participants collected across 6 timepoints by MPI
Vernon), the proposed project will significantly advance the goal of objective, efficient, and scalable
clinical outcome measurement for youth with autism. Our collaborative research teams will use
computational linguistics to identify objective, quantitative predictors of clinical intervention outcomes in autistic
youth and chart individual trajectories of change.
We hypothesize that (a) youth assigned to the START intervention group will demonstrate significant gains in
linguistic markers of social phenotype in comparison to waitlist controls, (b) across the entire START cohort,
modeling individual trajectories of growth in linguistic markers of social phenotype will identify subgroups with
unique baseline factors that moderate the slope of change, and (c) linguistic markers that predict social
communication success will vary by speaker (male vs. female) and context (same-sex vs opposite-sex
conversations). We will also validate our linguistic features as social communication outcome metrics over time.
We also anticipate that identified vocal/linguistic features will have high convergent validity with existing
measures of social communication outcome and social impression ratings, and high discriminant validity with
measures of restricted/repetitive behaviors and interests.
This R03 proposal addresses NIDCD Strategic Plan Theme 3 to promote a precision medicine approach to
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of conditions that impact speech and communicative functioning, such as
autism. A key output of this project will be validated computational linguistic features that can be used for clinical
outcome measurement in autism. These metrics hold promise for both (a) efficiently and objectively quantifying
post-intervention clinical outcome in autism and (b) guiding precision tailoring for future intervention
implementations. Thus, the proposed project fills an important knowledge gap that could significantly advance
the goal of objective, efficient, and scalable clinical outcome measurement and intervention response monitoring

The brain undergoes anatomical and physiological changes with the onset of puberty, of which synaptic pruning
and increased myelination in a posterior-to-anterior gradient are hallmarks. These neural changes are reflected
in the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG), with sleep intensity and depth sharply declining and sleep integrity
plateauing during adolescence. Supported by R01 MH118308, we leveraged sleep EEG data from a population-
based cohort of children followed-up as adolescents with which we studied the age-related trajectories of slow
wave activity (SWA), sleep spindle density (SSD) and odds ratio product (ORP), three EEG biomarkers of sleep
intensity, integrity and depth, respectively. We showed that each followed distinct maturational trajectories,
differentially depending upon sex and pubertal development. In addition, we showed that, compared to typically
developing youth, those with unmedicated attention/learning disorders had a maturational disruption in SWA
during childhood and greater ORP levels in adolescence, while those with unmedicated internalizing disorders
showed a lower loss of frontal SWA in the transition to adolescence but greater ORP when medicated with
antidepressants. The lack of young adult data did not permit unveiling whether those developmental trajectories
were predictive of mental health outcomes at ages 20 to 30, a lifespan period critical for increased severity of
psychopathology. Federal research priorities include understanding the developmental trajectories of mental
health disorders across the lifespan and their underlying brain mechanisms. Hence, in this application, we
propose to study the association of SWA, SSD and ORP with young adult psychopathology by leveraging sleep
EEG data from the 15-year follow-up of a unique population-based child cohort, studied under our prior R01
MH118308 for their child (median 9y) and adolescent (median 16y) data and who are being recruited under R01
HL136587 for their young adult data (median 25y). We aim to leverage data from these subjects at age 20 years
or older and assessed for their sleep EEG and clinically-meaningful psychopathology outcomes. We will study
the longitudinal association between the trajectories of SWA, SSD and ORP with internalizing symptoms and
suicidality (Aim 1) and externalizing behaviors and working memory (Aim 2), and how these sleep EEG
trajectories may play a mechanistic role in the increased coexistence of internalizing and externalizing
psychopathology in young adulthood (Aim 3). Given the known sex differences in brain maturation, we will test
whether the associations in Aims 1-3 differ between males and females (Aim 4). This study will help better
understand the developmental trajectories of psychopathology as they relate to altered brain maturation and
sleep disruption at different life stages. Findings from this study will inform novel biomarkers for clinical trials that
aim at improving the pathophysiology and long-term prognosis of diverse forms of psychopathology across the
life span by targeting the sleeping brain."
10871750,"Human cells including epithelial cells are equipped with cell-autonomous host defense programs providing
protection against intracellular pathogens. These host protective programs are controlled in a temporal and
spatial manner and respond to extracellular cues including pro-inflammatory cytokines released by professional
immune cells. Arguably, the most potent inducer of antibacterial cell-autonomous host defense is lymphocyte-
derived interferon-gamma (IFN). IFN-receptor signaling in human epithelial cells induces the expression of
hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) encoding antimicrobial proteins. While a few ISGs have been studied
in much detail, our understanding of most ISGs and their functions in host defense is limited. We recently
discovered a critical role for IFN-inducible guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) in cell-autonomous immunity to
Gram-negative bacterial pathogens invading the host cell cytosol. Human GBP1 is a cytosolically localized
member this GBP family and able to directly detect a central building block of the Gram-negative bacterial outer
membrane, i.e. lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Our previous work showed that GBP1, through these LPS interactions,
forms a multimeric microcapsule or coatomer surrounding Gram-negatives invading the host cell cytosol.
However, GBP1 binding to the bacterial surface on its own is neither bactericidal nor bacteriostatic, implicating
other GBP1-dependent co-factors required for sterilizing cell-autonomous immunity. Aim1 of our proposal will
explore a novel GBP1-dependent pathway that results in bacterial ubiquitylation, a well-established ‘eat-me’
signal that marks cytosolic microbial invaders for destruction. Our studies are multidisciplinary and include
biochemical approaches levering a novel in vitro GBP1-bacteria binding assay that we established. Using this
assay, we will directly assess how GBP1 promotes the recruitment of IFN-inducible host ubiquitin E3 ligases to
the surface of the Gram-negative cytosol-invading bacterial pathogen Shigella flexneri. S. flexneri is a human-
adapted enteric pathogen that causes dysentery and diarrheal deaths, especially in children in low- and middle-
income countries. Our preliminary data demonstrate that wildtype S. flexneri is resistant to GBP1-dependent and
-independent host-driven bacterial ubiquitylation. Therefore, in our second aim we will identify and characterize
a network of virulence factors used by S. flexneri to escape IFN-induced ubiquitylation and associated host
defenses. To define the physiological relevance of these antagonistic relationships between antibacterial ISGs
and counter-acting bacterial virulence mechanisms employed by S. flexneri, we will exploit a novel mouse model
of intestinal S. flexneri infections. Using ISG-deficient mouse lines established in our lab and, reciprocally,
infecting with S. flexneri mutants defective for virulence effectors targeting the same ISGs, we will determine the
physiological importance of GBP- and other ISG-driven host defenses and their evasion by S. flexneri for
bacterial pathogenesis and enteric disease."

Changes in the aged brain that occur with stroke, head injury or Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD)
result in chronic cognitive and motor deficits. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently received attention
to reverse or slow neurodegenerative and injury-related changes in the aging brain as they suppress
inflammation and facilitate tissue repair and remyelination. We have now completed studies as part of R21-
NS102991 and R56-NS112207 that have shown that MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs), the active
product of MSCs, accelerate and enhance recovery of motor function following cortical injury in aged female
monkeys. EV-treated monkeys exhibited full recovery by 3-5 weeks post-injury and untreated monkeys reached
a plateau in recovery by 8-12 weeks post-injury. At a chronic recovery stage (16-weeks post-injury, R21-
NS102991), MSC-EVs reduced injury-induced microglial neuroinflammation, neuronal excitotoxicity, synapse
loss, oligodendrocyte damage and myelination deficits. However, the precise nature of how MSC-EVs act within
both acute or chronic stages of recovery after injury remains unknown and is important to decipher in order to
fine tune the efficacious use of MSC-EVs for age-related injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Our preliminary
analysis of injury- and MSC-EV-associated changes in blood and brain tissue collected at an earlier stage of
recovery (6 weeks post-injury, R56-NS112207) showed early treatment-related differences in microglial
phenotypes and neuronal excitability that are distinct from treatment-related differences observed at 16-week
post-injury. Therefore, we now propose to continue and expand these studies to combine in vivo behavioral, MRI
and proteomic CSF and blood biomarker analyses with comprehensive proteomic and single-cell transcriptomic
profiling and physiological and histological assessments of brain tissue harvested at distinct time points during
recovery (3, 6, 9 weeks post- injury) from male and females aged monkeys. Furthermore, using advance human-
derived in-vitro models, we will elucidate specific encapsulated miRNAs or/and proteins of MSC-EVs that
ameliorate injury-related inflammatory and oxidative responses, and facilitate recovery and neuroprotection. We
hypothesize that MSC-EVs contain miRNA and protein signals that modulate the acute response to injury and
mitigate immediate damage, leading to reduced secondary chronic inflammation and degeneration, promoting a
restorative microenvironment that will facilitate neural plasticity later in recovery. These studies will elucidate the
temporal progression, sex-dependent dynamics and cell-specific molecular mechanism(s) of action of MSC-EV
mediated recovery, that will pave the way for its potential development as a therapeutic for age-related injury
and neurodegenerative diseases in humans."

 Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a fatal disease, remains therapeutically underserved due
to limited understanding of molecular factors underlying its emergence and progression. Through unbiased
transcriptomics analysis of an early CRPC model developed in our lab and patient dataset analyses, we have
discovered that stimulation of the nitric oxide receptor complex, soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), in conjunction
with standard-of-care androgen deprivation (AD) is likely to be therapeutically beneficial in CRPC. Based on our
preliminary results, our hypothesis is that decreased sGC activity promotes CRPC growth and that increasing
sGC activity will limit CRPC emergence and progression. The rationale of our studies, supported by our findings
and well-characterized sGC regulatory mechanisms from the cardiopulmonary field, is that sGC is oxidized and
refractory to stimulation in CRPC but is functionally regenerated by AD-induced redox-protective responses.
Thus, the combinatorial use of sGC agonists and AD is predicted to be an effective strategy to combat CRPC.
The sGC agonist, riociguat, is FDA-approved as a vasodilator in pulmonary hypertension treatment. Our
preliminary data show riociguat reduces xenograft CRPC growth. This anti-tumor response is accompanied by
lowered PSA levels as well as increased systemic and intratumoral cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels, indicating on-
target stimulation of sGC bioactivity. Consistent with the physiologic function of enhanced sGC activity, we find
riociguat treatment leads to marked tumor oxygenation and decreased levels of CD44, a key PC stem cell
marker. Thus, riociguat efficacy may derive from eradication of hypoxic niches and the residing androgen-
refractory stem cell populations thought to underlie CRPC. Hypoxia also alters the tumor redox state through
mitochondrially-generated ROS that regulate angiogenic signaling. Through its putative targeting of cancer stem
cells and redox vulnerabilities, riociguat is novel in PC therapy, and is safe and well-tolerated longterm. Our
objective is to comprehensively establish mechanisms underlying how and why stimulating the sGC pathway
limits CRPC growth and progression. Therefore, in these studies, we will assess 1) how mechanisms that control
sGC expression and regenerate oxidized inactive sGC are altered in hormone-sensitive vs. castration-resistant
cells, 2) how enhancement of sGC bioactivity induces anti-CRPC outcomes through consideration of hypoxia-
associated metabolic and redox stresses, including those induced by androgen receptor re-activation under AD,
and 3) test riociguat efficacy in the spectrum of CRPC disease, using robust preclinical and patient-derived
models encompassing emergence, growth, progression and metastatic bone colonization. We will validate key
molecular findings in de-identified PC patient specimens. Our studies possess strong potential to uncover novel
mechanisms underlying PC progression, and for clinical translation via repurposing riociguat to treat CRPC."

 An important milestone in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the discovery of
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations as an effective therapeutic target and the
successful development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). AZD9291 (TAGRISSOTM or
osimertinib) represents a 3rd generation EGFR-TKI and an FDA-approved drug for patients with EGFR mutant
NSCLC that has become resistant to 1st generation EGFR-TKIs through the T790M mutation and for EGFR
mutation-positive advanced NSCLC as a front line treatment. Unfortunately, patients eventually relapse and
become resistant to AZD9291 in the clinic, resulting in disease progression. Thus, a better understanding of
the underlying mechanisms and development of effective strategies to overcome AZD9291 resistance is an
urgent and critical area of unmet need in the clinic. The C-MYC gene was the first Myc family member found in
the human genome and its product, c-Myc, functions as a transcription factor to regulate the expression of
many genes whose products are involved in the regulation of various physiological processes, such as cell
survival, proliferation, differentiation, metabolism and host immunity. MYC is genetically activated and/or
overexpressed in most types of human cancer including lung cancer and thus is a central driver of malignant
cellular growth and proliferation. c-Myc expression is associated with response or sensitivity of cancer cells to
chemotherapy or radiotherapy. However, no study has linked c-Myc to targeted therapy by third generation
EGFR-TKIs. Our strong preliminary data support the overall hypothesis that c-Myc modulation may play a
critical role in mediating therapeutic efficacy of AZD9291 against EGFRm NSCLC and the development of
acquired resistance to AZD9291; accordingly, targeting c-Myc will be an effective strategy to overcome
acquired resistance to AZD9291 and other EGFR-TKIs. This hypothesis will be tested by accomplishing the
following 3 specific aims: 1) To understand the mechanism(s) by which c-Myc is reduced in EGFR mutant
NSCLC cells by AZD9291 or other EGFR-TKIs; 2) To demonstrate the biological significance of c-Myc
suppression in EGFR-targeted therapy; and 3) To develop effective therapeutic regimens to overcome
acquired resistance to AZD9291 by targeting c-Myc. The objectives of this study are to understand the
mechanisms by which AZD9291 and other EGFR-TKIs decrease c-Myc levels, to demonstrate the biological
significance of c-Myc suppression during EGFR-targeted cancer therapy; and to develop effective strategies to
overcome acquired resistance to AZD9291 by targeting c-Myc. This proposal is of high scientific and
translational significance. The outcomes of this study can be immediately translated to the clinical treatment of
NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to AZD9291 or other EGFR-TKIs.

10881687,"The recent development and FDA approval of a number of new drugs heralded a new era of prostate cancer
therapy. However, metastatic prostate cancer remains a fatal disease. Thus, there is a critical need to identify
prostate cancers that will progress to metastatic and develop effective therapies to treat them early to stop
disease progression. The proposed study addresses these critical areas of need. In our preliminary studies, via
an unbiased analysis of close to 400 clinical samples and subsequent experimental validation, we identified
loss of the FAM3B (family with sequence similarity 3B) gene as a potential driver of metastatic progression of
prostate cancer. We further found that FAM3B loss leads to diminished oxidative phosphorylation and
enhanced aerobic glycolysis, which is a known mechanism of prostate cancer progression.
Building on these novel findings, we hypothesize that loss of FAM3B drives prostate cancer progression to an
advanced stage and that this is mediated, at least in part, by suppressing oxidative phosphorylation and
promoting aerobic glycolysis. This hypothesis will be tested by two specific aims that employ clinically relevant
model systems and clinical datasets. Aim 1 will dissect the mechanism by which FAM3B loss modulates
glucose metabolism in driving disease progression. Aim 2 will establish FAM3B loss as a driver of prostate
cancer progression.
By interrogating the FAM3B-glucose-metabolism axis from a mechanistic and functional perspective, the
proposed study will reveal a new and important mechanism driving prostate cancer progression, provide a new
marker to better identify those patients, including the Veterans, with aggressive disease so that they can be
treated early and effectively. Moreover, understanding the precise mechanisms by which FAM3B loss impacts
glucose metabolism and drives disease progression will aid in future design of inhibitors that specifically target
FAM3B-low prostate cancer. Overall, the application addresses an area that is highly relevant to the prostate
cancer field, from both biological and translational perspectives."
10881688,"The overarching objective of my research program is to identify markers for prognosis and therapeutic
interventions for squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), hence improving health outcomes for veterans. SCCs arise
from stratified epithelia; the most relevant organ sites in veterans are the skin and oral cavity where high
exposure to UV irradiation and tobacco carcinogens make the total and high-risk SCCs significantly higher than
in the civilian population. The worst outcome of SCC is death caused by distant metastasis. Skin SCC deaths
exceed melanoma deaths and SCC deaths in the head and neck are 3-4 times higher than skin SCC deaths.
The long-term goal of my VA research program is to identify markers for prognosis and therapeutic interventions
for SCCs, hence improving health outcomes for veterans. Since being funded in 2016 by a VA Merit Award, my
laboratory has been studying mechanisms related to SCC progression and therapeutic interventions. These
studies continuously translate into clinical diagnosis and therapeutic interventions directly impacting veterans’
healthcare outcomes. My laboratory pioneered inducible and epithelial-specific genetic engineered mouse
models (GEMMs) that develop SCCs and metastasis in the natural microenvironment and immune system.
These models provide unique resources for cross-species comparisons with human SCCs and performing
experimental therapeutics, including immunotherapy, in my past and ongoing Merit Award research. SCCs are
often indolent for decades. In the previous funding period, we focused on studying how SCCs break indolence
to become aggressive and metastatic cancers. We found that the properties of a subset of cancer stem cells
(CSCs) are responsible for breaking indolence through both clonogenicity and invasion. We found that
“heterozygous loss” of SMAD4, a tumor suppressor, in 30-50% of head and neck SCCs in humans, is a result of
significant inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity at the single cell level, and that SMAD4 mutant cells have a
growth/survival advantage allowing them to take over the entire population of tumor cells. These findings
provide critical prognostic value for examining SMAD4 genomic status at the single cell level. Further, SMAD4-
deficient SCC cells have “Brca-like” defects in DNA damage repair that are susceptible to cancer
therapies that target DNA repair pathways. This finding provides an important link for a therapeutic marker
and strategy, and instigated an investigator-initiated clinical trial to treat locally advanced head and neck SCC
with radiotherapy (RT) in combination with Olaparib, which included recruiting VA patients. In tumor stroma, we
found that SMAD4 genomic loss triggers overproduction of TGFβ1, an immune suppressor and promoter for
cancer progression. In addition, cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secret more TGFβ than cancer cells
and provide a CSC niche at the distant metastasis site for CSC clonal expansion. We also found that
tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to breaking indolence by CSC expansion through anti-
apoptosis and angiogenesis. Further, SMAD4 mutant SCC cells have advantages in clonogenicity and
immune evasion but paradoxically produce more DNA damage-associated neoantigens susceptible to
anti-tumor immunity, pointing to therapeutic intervention strategies. We identified that SCCs with Smad4 loss
changed the TME to be TGFβ and PD-L1-rich in myeloid cells, which are highly susceptible to immune
eradication by dual TGFβ/PD-L1 targeting. These findings are ready to be translated to a clinical trial of
radiotherapy in combination with dual TGFβ/PD-L1 targeting in advanced head and neck SCC patients including
VA patient accrual, thus bringing therapeutic intervention in real time to our veterans. Ongoing research areas
include: 1) Assess intrinsic properties of SCC cells that contribute to self-autonomous expansion and metastasis.
2) Identify SCC metastatic niche established by stromal cells. 3) Identify mechanisms of SCC immune evasion
and immunotherapy interventions for SCCs."

Down syndrome (DS) is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, which results in a wide variety of
outcomes including unique facial features, medical vulnerabilities, and intellectual disability. It also results in
premature aging processes and a high risk for Alzheimer's dementia (AD), both associated with cognitive
decline. One crucial goal of research on DS is to understand the developmental course of cognitive decline,
including when (or at what age) declines in various cognitive functions begin. This knowledge would open the
door to early pharmaceutical, behavioral, or environmental interventions designed to slow the progression of
early aging and AD in this population. The broad, long-term objective of the proposed project is to identify early
cognitive decline in youth with DS during late adolescence into early adulthood. The proposed 3-year
longitudinal study will enroll participants with DS aged 15-25 years. This age period is just before the age when
cognitive decline becomes apparent in some functions in healthy neurotypical adults. Further, amyloid
evidence suggests that this age period may very well align with the preclinical stage of AD in the DS
population. Participants will complete a battery of cognitive and behavioral measures three times spaced at 18-
month intervals, for a span of three years. The measures either (a) have been linked to AD progression in older
adults with DS (e.g., Krinsky-McHale, Devenny, & Silverman, 2002) or (b) have been documented recently as
declining during this age period (Conners, Tungate, Abbeduto, Merrill, & Faught, 2018). Syndrome specificity
will be assessed by comparing participants with DS to participants with non-DS intellectual disability matched
on age and nonverbal ability. Also, a variety of covariates will be measured to further enhance interpretation of
developmental trends. Aim 1 is to identify early cognitive decline (episodic memory, executive function,
phonological memory, expressive vocabulary, receptive grammar); Aim 2 is to identify changes in other
domains that are related to aging and/or progression toward AD (e.g., adaptive behavior, maladaptive
behavior, gait, and psychomotor speed); Aim 3 is to link observed cognitive and behavioral changes to
symptoms of MCI (e.g., everyday orientation, concentration, basic functioning) as measured by instruments
such as the Modified Mini-Mental State Exam. The proposed study will move the field forward by identifying
developmental trends (especially declines) in a unique age range in DS across a broad array of measures.
Future directions include extending the longitudinal time frame and adding amyloid/tau measures to better
interpret declines as AD-related or not."

Endometriosis affects 10-15% of women of reproductive age, and the incidence increases to 50-60% in women
with chronic pelvic pain and infertility. The current treatments include surgical removal of lesions or hormonal
suppression; however, these may have many side effects and high risks of relapse. Precision-targeted therapy
with a non-hormonal drug can successfully eradicate endometriosis lesions and alleviate pain symptoms while
reducing its off-target toxicity. pSTAT3 signaling plays a crucial role in immunosuppression and inflammation in
endometriosis. A potential therapeutic approach then is to downregulate the endometriosis-specific
inflammation using antioxidant drugs. Cerium oxide nanoparticles (nanoceria) are potent STAT3 inhibitors due
to their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. The small-sized nanoceria can accumulate in
endometriotic lesions by extravasation through permeable, angiogenic endometrial vasculature. Our
preliminary results demonstrated pSTAT3 overexpression leads to estrogen-dependent inflammation in
endometriosis, and our ROS scavenging nanoceria remarkably reduces the number of endometriotic lesions in
a mouse model. The nanodrug (nanoceria), coated with albumin protein and conjugated with NIR fluorescent
dye (indocyanine green), shows successful systemic endometrial tissue targeting under photoacoustic image
guidance. We hypothesize the novel nanodrug (albumin-nanoceria-ICG) will significantly suppress
endometriotic lesion growth and result in reduced pain and infertility. Multimodal imaging simultaneously offers
real-time monitoring of endometriosis progression and pregnancy and fetal development in living animals. Aim
1 will investigate how pSTAT3 in endometriosis contributes to inflammatory and immunosuppressive conditions
using our endometriosis mouse model and in vivo imaging. Aim 2 will evaluate the theranostic potential of
nanoceria on endometriosis progression and pain alleviation. Aim 3 examines whether the nanodrug will
improve fertility, endometrial receptivity, and implantation. The proposed studies will support uncovering the
molecular mechanism of inflammation in endometriosis and lead to non-surgical and non-hormonal treatment."
10881768,"I am an Orthopaedic Sports Medicine specialist pursuing a career as a clinician-scientist
focusing on the biology of soft tissue healing to bone. The comprehensive training plan
described in this proposal will uniquely position me as a surgeon-scientist to i) investigate the
biology of soft-tissue-to-bone healing, ii) characterize novel approaches for growth factor
delivery and scaffold design, iii) perform preclinical assessments of potential therapies and,
ultimately, iv) design and operate appropriately powered clinical trials aimed at improving the
treatment of soft tissue musculoskeletal injuries.
There are 32 million musculoskeletal injuries in the United States annually of which 45% involve
tendons or ligaments. Complete tendon and ligament separation injuries do not heal back to
their bony attachments without surgical intervention and, thus, are often treated with surgical
procedures including rotator cuff tendon repairs and anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions.
There are more than 5.7 million people with a rotator cuff tendon tear in the US alone and this
number is increasing as our population ages. In addition, there are more than 200,000 ACL
injuries in the US each year; the incidence of these injuries in the military population is ten times
higher than that of the civilian population. Normal tendon and ligament insertions to bone are
comprised of a complex tissue structure that effectively transmits the interactions between
dynamic muscle tissues and the rigid skeleton. Unfortunately, surgically repaired tendon tears
and ligament reconstruction procedures characteristically “heal” with an abnormal tissue
architecture that results in inferior biomechanical properties resulting in high failure rates. In this
proposal we aim to stimulate local progenitor cells to repair the enthesis via a novel approach by
delivering bisphosphonate-targeted growth factors to the bony site of the ruptured enthesis
coupled with the insertion of a uniquely-designed biomimetic scaffold embedded with those
factors.
The CDA award would provide me the opportunity to turn potential into results. In order to
accomplish the aims of this proposal we have assembled an internationally-recognized
mentoring team to provide me with the technical training required for this research. In parallel
with my mentored technical training, instruction in career development, drug discovery, data
analysis and translational aspects relevant to my research goals will be provided via the UCLA
CTSA-sponsored Training Program in Translational Science modules and supplemental
graduate school course work. With guaranteed protected time, institutional financial support
from my Department and 500 square feet of independent laboratory space and with
transdisciplinary, cross-specialty guidance provided by my mentorship committee, my scientific
advisory panel and my team of collaborators to assist in my development into an independent
translational scientist, The ultimate goal is to allow me to successfully i) compete for additional
VA, NIH and DoD grant funding, ii) manage a laboratory and iii) concurrently navigate a career
that flourishes at both the benchtop and the bedside."

The goal of our research program is to dissect the mechanisms underlying the establishment and activity of
cis-regulatory elements and their control of transcriptional gene networks. We are focused on the cellular
response to DNA damage, a well-conserved pathway required for preservation of genome fidelity and overall
organismal homeostasis. During this funding period, we will focus on the activity of the transcription factor p53,
which acts a central hub within the DNA damage gene regulatory network. Misregulation of p53 activity is
directly implicated in numerous human diseases, but we lack key insight into how p53 controls cell fate
decisions after exposure to DNA damage. We have generated a set of novel hypotheses regarding how cis-
regulatory elements, combinatorial transcription factor activity, and 3D genome structure work in concert with
p53 to maintain genome fidelity. Our group utilizes advanced genetic, epigenetic, and genomic engineering
combined with classical genetic and biochemical models to parse the mechanistic contributions of regulatory
elements, chromatin structure, and transcription factor activity to DNA damage response transcription and
ultimately, cell fate determination. Mapping functional networks and mechanisms controlling the DNA damage
response will significantly broaden our understanding of human development, aging, and build towards precise
molecular control over therapeutic cellular reprogramming paradigms and genome editing."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is an orphan disease with a delayed diagnosis and markedly elevated
mortality from right heart failure. Despite nearly a dozen FDA-approved drugs for PAH, median survival is only
seven years. All approved therapies target one of three vasodilatory pathways, and none are disease
modifying. This application has two objectives: 1) Understand dynamic and static relationships between
molecular markers and PAH progression and resilience; 2) Identify molecular features of PAH risk and
resilience in individuals harboring a PAH-causing mutation. It is unknown why some at risk individuals develop
PAH and others do not. BMPR2 mutations are present in about 30% of patients with PAH but clinical
penetrance is only 20%. Unaffected BMPR2 mutation carriers (UMCs) are a unique and understudied
population that may also provide clues to disease trajectory in patients with clinical PAH. Longitudinal natural
history studies with molecular profiling in PAH are lacking. Most molecular profiling studies in PAH are cross-
sectional which limits understanding of how disease progression and disease markers relate over time. We
propose a strategy of dense clinical and molecular phenotyping at multiple timepoints to overcome inferential
limitations of cross-sectional studies. This application will leverage the clinical and research infrastructure built
at Vanderbilt over the past 35 years in our study of PAH patients. The investigators share an extensive
published record of recruiting patients with this rare disease and related UMCs. We hypothesize that a
comprehensive understanding of risk and resilience over time in patients and genetically susceptible
individuals will provide insight into disease severity and identify novel therapeutic targets in patients with PAH.
Aim 1 will identify static and dynamic molecular features of disease progression and resilience. 1a: Perform
serial clinical, proteomic, and gene expression profiling in HPAH, IPAH, and healthy controls 3 times over 4
years. Bioinformatic and network medicine analyses will identify proteins and RNAs associated with changes in
clinical outcomes, functional capacity, and RV function in the parent cohort and two external validation cohorts.
1b: Test whether adding molecular risk/resilience markers will improve the performance of a widely used PAH
risk prediction tool (REVEAL 2.0 Risk Score). Aim 2 will identify the clinical and molecular factors that promote
resilience and susceptibility to PAH in a longitudinal cohort of UMCs. UMCs will undergo serial clinical and
molecular phenotyping as in Aim 1. Proteins/genes that mirror PAH are “risk factors” and those that mirror a
healthy population are “resilience factors”. Explanatory models will be developed and tested in validation
cohorts. We will test UMC risk and resilience features for associations with clinical outcomes in PAH patients
and risk prediction performance. These studies will identify signatures of risk and resilience to PAH
progression and penetrance, offering an initial step toward personalizing care and surveillance guided by
biologic data."

The mouse somatosensory thalamus participates in fundamental processes including sensory processing, sleep
and pathological rhythmic behaviors like seizure. Local thalamic interneurons have been considerably
overlooked due to their sparsity in the total neuronal population. However, their extensive dendritic arborizations
spanning almost the entire breadth of the nucleus, together with my preliminary data, point to an important role
for these cells in thalamic functions. Thalamic interneuron dendrites are capable of releasing synaptic vesicles,
defying traditional definitions of neuronal input and output structures, while greatly increasing their capacity for
complex computations. Of interest, local thalamic interneurons are also capable of forming diverse and
uncommon synaptic relationships including triadic synapses. The primary conceptual goals this project seeks to
address are to define the rules that govern dendritic signal integration and to define the functional role these
interneurons play in the canonical thalamocortical circuit. I hypothesize that unique structural features enable
unique functions. Specifically, I predict that electrotonically isolated dendritic locations enable numerous
encoding processes to occur simultaneously and independently from the soma. Thus, thalamic interneurons
pose unique opportunities to study fundamental principles of neuronal computation including the ambiguous role
of triadic inhibition. Taking place at Columbia University with Sponsor Prof. Chris Makinson and Co-Sponsor
Prof. Liam Paninksi, I will use the newest generation of high-gain voltage indicators and multi-photon in vitro and
in vivo imaging to investigate the imperative questions outlined above. This fellowship represents a substantial
opportunity for high-quality training in state-of-the-art imaging and computational neuroscience techniques and
approaches that complement my background in neurobiology and electrophysiology. I aim to address the
influence of local interneurons in thalamic functions by observing and manipulating their activity during thalamic
oscillations. I will also apply synthetic synaptic inputs to probe with precision input distribution patterns and the
biophysical mechanisms underlying dendritic integration in thalamic interneurons. Data from these experiments
will be used to build realistic and well constrained computer simulations to further test precise mechanisms in
shaping receptive field structures. I expect to find that interneurons act as an integral member of the
thalamocortical circuit and to gain insight into fundamental concepts of neuronal computation through their
interrogation. Moving forward, I hope to build upon the conceptual and technical advances outlined here to
uncover the causative mechanisms involved in sensory perception and the role of thalamic interneurons in
disease."
10915637,"Project Summary / Abstract
Optic neuropathy causes irreversible vision loss because humans and other mammals cannot repair the optic
nerve or repopulate the nerve cells that comprise it (retinal ganglion cells or RGCs). Glaucoma, the most
common optic neuropathy, is projected to affect more than 110 million people by 2040, and to cause bilateral
blindness in more than 10% of them. Stem cell therapy holds great potential for treating neurodegenerative
diseases that currently have no cure, including glaucoma and other optic neuropathies. By generating human
RGCs in a dish and transplanting them into the eye, it might be possible to replace lost RGCs, regenerate the
optic nerve, and reverse blindness from optic neuropathy. Achieving RGC replacement will require significant
advances in our ability to ensure survival of transplanted cells and facilitate their communication (integration)
with the visual system. Significant work is ongoing to develop methods to drive RGC nerve fiber (axon) growth
towards visual centers in the brain. However, RGC survival after transplantation and communication with other
neurons in the retina (i.e. bipolar and amacrine cells) are equally important and have been less well studied.
Through this mentored clinician-scientist career development project, Dr. Thomas Johnson proposes
to advance the field of stem cell transplantation for optic nerve regeneration by improving survival and
retinal integration of transplanted human RGCs. To so, he will address three specific aims: (1) Generation
of novel human cell lines genetically engineered for improved survival after transplantation by targeting
molecular pathways involved in RGC death and neuroprotection; (2) Determination of how optic nerve
neurodegenerative disease states affect survival and integration of RGCs transplanted into the eye; and (3)
Elucidation of how transplanted RGCs sense barriers to retinal integration and development of methods for
overcoming these obstacles. The proposed work will address key limitations of prior translational optic nerve
regeneration research by using experimental models that are more applicable to human disease, increasing
the experimental rigor of transplant outcome assessments, determining which RGC subtypes are most likely to
survive and integrate, and controlling for “material transfer” from transplanted cells to the recipient retina.
Dr. Johnson is an early-career glaucoma specialist and neuroscientist who will conduct this project in an
outstanding research environment at Johns Hopkins’ Wilmer Eye Institute, under the mentorship of an
interdisciplinary team of senior investigators, including Drs. Don Zack, Harry Quigley, and Alex Kolodkin. Over
five years he will acquire expertise in emerging molecular biology and neuroscience techniques required for
achieving his long-term goals of: leading an independent high-impact optic nerve regeneration research
laboratory, providing outstanding medical and surgical care to patients with glaucoma; and bridging the gap
between the clinic and laboratory by helping to usher in a new era of glaucoma treatment though RGC
replacement and optic nerve regeneration."
10915642,"SUMMARY
Traditional phase I dose-finding strategies monitor drug response only for two weeks, based on the assumption
that it will suﬃce to observe how therapy aﬀects doubling time of a homogeneous population over 2-4
generations. But with the paradigm shift that most cancers are heterogeneous comes an urgent need to consider
that therapy-induced shifts in population composition manifest over longer time frames. We previously coined
the “tip-over hypothesis of DNA damage therapy sensitivity”, proposing that cytotoxic therapy is eﬀective if it pushes
a cell’s somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) load above a tipping point. Variable proximity of co-existing
tumor cells to this tipping point imply that dose-response relations need not be monotonic. Cytotoxic therapy can
drive one cell into apoptosis, while skyrocketing another cell into malignant proliferation. As the developers of
widely used computational and mathematical methods, with established research programs in tumor
metabolism, and with a broad record of modeling dynamic processes and integrating various omics- and
imaging platforms, our team brings complementary expertise to develop a personalized cytotoxic therapy strategy
that confines therapy-induced selection of resistant clones. We will test the potential of tumor cell DNA content and
dNTP substrate availability to predict a tumor’s vulnerability to increasing SCNA rate. Hereby, the
aforementioned tipping point is accounted for not by elevated SCNA load alone, but by an inability of the tissue
micro-environment (TME) to provide the necessary resources. Experiments are proposed in stomach and brain
tumors—two cancer types whose TME can “aﬀord” vastly diﬀerent amounts of DNA. Our preliminary studies
show that energetic costs of DNA content levels required for >75% SCNA load do not, in the absence of cytotoxic
therapy, justify the masking benefits they bring. In particular, we showed that limiting dNTP concentrations
amplify divergence in S-phase duration between high- and low-ploidy cells. Our hypothesis is that cytotoxic
therapy causes a net-increase in fitness of tumors that exceed the SCNA tipping point. This hypothesis is
founded on two unexpected recent findings: (i) integrated single-cell RNA- and DNA-sequencing analyses of
stomach cancer cells suggests that the risk of cell death immediately after an SCNA event, rather than just SCNA
rate, impacts clonal diversity. Aim 1 will integrate single cell sequencing with imaging and mathematical
modeling of heterogeneous populations that evolve through chromosome missegregations, to examine observed
SCNA landscapes and missegregation tolerances, and to predict effective cytotoxic therapy doses. (ii) Even
minimal changes in DNA content among co-existing clones within the same Glioblastoma can result in
significantly longer S-phases. Aim 2 will evaluate Oxygen, Phosphate and Glucose as rate-limiting substrates of
dNTP synthesis of co-evolving subpopulations in stomach and brain tissue environments. This is the first study
to investigate if and how clinical decisions can benefit from integrating a tumor environment’s energetic
provision with the energetic demands of cancer cells’ genomic makeup."
10915643,"ABSTRACT. Breast cancer screening programs suffer from false positive mammograms, unnecessary biopsies,
overdiagnosis, and overtreatment. A major contributor to the poor performance of screening mammography is
the diagnostic and prognostic uncertainty of mammographically detected calcifications. Breast calcifications
represent a biological continuum from benign disease to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to aggressive cancer.
Radiologists struggle to correlate their imaging appearance with the underlying pathology and roughly two-thirds
of biopsied calcifications return with a benign pathology. Although calcifications evolve dynamically over time,
the current management strategy relies heavily on the static appearance of calcifications from the most recent
mammogram. Most women in screening programs have multiple mammograms, yet this temporal information is
consistently underutilized in clinical decision making. There is thus an urgent need to quantify the dynamics of
calcifications from serial mammograms, and to characterize the relationship between calcification trajectories
and disease biology. In the absence of such innovation, increasingly sensitive screening modalities are expected
to further increase the burden of unnecessary diagnostic work-up and breast cancer overdiagnosis. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that dynamic imageable and tissue biomarkers contain actionable diagnostic and
prognostic information about mammographic calcifications. The use of established diagnostic imaging
(mammography) in conjunction with investigational imageable biomarkers will enable testing of this hypothesis.
Key to this proposal will be the creation of a large database of retrospectively and prospectively collected cohorts
of patients with serial mammograms, tissue samples and clinical outcomes. This proposal will consist of three
specific aims: (1) Develop a static model of breast calcifications to improve the clinical performance of
mammography screening; 2) Develop a dynamic model of breast calcifications to predict histopathology and
DCIS prognosis; and 3) Combine the dynamic calcification model with tissue-based biomarkers of the underlying
evolutionary dynamics to delineate DCIS prognosis. The proposed research is highly innovative because it adds
the temporal dimension to computer-assisted classification of mammographic calcifications, yields a joint
characterization of calcification growth trajectories and lesion biology, and develops dynamic risk models to
predict invasive progression in women undergoing active monitoring for DCIS. This proposal will be co-led by
Dr. Grimm (breast radiologist) and Dr. Ryser (mathematical modeler) supported by a highly collaborative
multidisciplinary team with expertise in cancer biology, computer vision, and surgical oncology. The overall
objective of this proposal is to develop a dynamic imageable biomarker that delineates lethal cancer from non-
lethal disease by leveraging the temporal dimension of serial mammograms. Ultimately, the long-term goal of
our work is to better identify which calcifications to biopsy (reduce unnecessary biopsies), and if pre-invasive
DCIS is found, to predict whether it will remain indolent or progress to lethal cancer (reduce overtreatment)."
10915644,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using engineered T cells – such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T cell receptor
(TCR) modified T cells – is an effective immunotherapy for hematologic malignancies. Success with ACT has
been elusive for solid tumors, which present unique challenges to T cells. ACT also requires conditioning
chemotherapy to deplete a patient’s endogenous T cells, which results in significant toxicity. Our goal is to
engineer T cells with synthetic functions to overcome hurdles of ACT for solid tumors including the need for
conditioning chemotherapy, which would dramatically improve the feasibility and safety of this therapy.
In this proposal we use the orthogonal IL2 cytokine-receptor pair developed by our collaborator Dr. Garcia at
Stanford. Orthogonal IL2Rβ (o2R) is only activated by the orthogonal IL2 (oIL2) cytokine, and not by wildtype
IL2. When activated, o2R signals through the intracellular domain (ICD) of IL2Rβ, which involves cooperation
with the native common gamma chain (γc). Leveraging this cooperation, we studied chimeric orthogonal
receptors in which the IL2Rβ ICD of o2R is replaced with ICDs of receptors for other γc cytokines, such that oIL2
elicits the corresponding γc signal. Of these chimeras, signaling through the IL9R ICD (o9R) generated a unique
STAT phosphorylation profile and differentiation trajectory, prompting further exploration in vivo. Despite a
weaker proliferative signal than o2R signaling, o9R signaling resulted in T cells with superior anti-tumor efficacy,
an effect pronounced in the absence of lymphodepletion.
To translate this finding into a viable treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors will require an
understanding of the functional features of o9R signaling T cells that permit their anti-tumor efficacy, especially
in the absence of conditioning chemotherapy. Our preliminary data led us to focus on two of these features,
which we tackle in Aims 1 and 2. In Aim 1, we focus on the peripheral in vivo effects of o9R signaling that rely
on interaction with the host, especially lymph node homing and priming. We hypothesize that the o9R signaling
reprograms T cells in the periphery for efficient lymph node homing and spatial positioning that promotes priming
that is critical for their anti-tumor effects in vivo. Aim 1 will use both TCR- and CAR- based syngeneic mouse
solid tumor models of ACT. In Aim 2, we turn to the cell-intrinsic effects of o9R signaling on effector capacity in
the face of chronic antigen stimulation. We hypothesize that o9R signaling interferes with the epigenetic changes
that drive T cell dysfunction in the context of chronic antigen stimulation, resulting in superior effector capacity.
Aim 2 will primarily use human T cells engineered with a TCR specific for the NY-ESO-1 antigen along with the
pmel model.
Our complementary aims outline an approach to define the effects of IL9R signaling in T cells that underlie their
anti-tumor functions in solid tumors without conditioning chemotherapy. Our findings will set the stage for the
therapeutic translation of T cells endowed with IL9R signaling."
10888694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This NHLBI R61/R33 exploratory/developmental project aims to develop and test a novel Axially Prestretched
Elastomeric Nanofibrillar Graft (APENG) for lower extremity arterial reconstructions. Lower extremity arterial
disease is a substantial public health burden associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and diminished
quality of life. Advanced stages of this disease commonly require open surgery with synthetic vascular bypass
grafts. While synthetic vascular grafts are generally considered successful, their failure rates in the main artery
in the leg, the femoropopliteal artery (FPA), are unacceptably high. Various advancements in existing graft
technologies have only shown limited improvements in the clinic as they do not address the underlying cause of
complications – the limb flexion-induced kinking and buckling of the graft. Our innovative APENG concept
addresses this problem by incorporating a substantial Axial Prestretch (AP) into the graft. AP is the in-built
mechanism in healthy young FPAs that counteracts limb flexion-induced compression, thereby preventing
arterial buckling and kinking. To achieve physiological levels of AP without inflicting potentially injurious high
axial forces or graft overdilation, we will mimic the anisotropic nature of native FPAs with substantially lower axial
stiffness by inducing circumferential fiber alignment in electrospun APENG. Our preliminary studies support this
concept by showing that APENG prototypes resist buckling and kinking during limb flexion, possess good
surgical handling characteristics, and undergo rapid functional regeneration in-vivo. Our team will employ
benchtop, human cadaver, computational, and large animal models for evaluation and optimization of APENG
prototypes and testing the hypothesis that FPA-tuned APENGs with optimized AP provide reduced limb flexion-
induced buckling, improved flow characteristics, and better functional regeneration than conventional stiff ePTFE
grafts without AP. Our research strategy is focused on reaching specific sequential milestones in the APENG
development and includes measurable deliverables for evaluating progress. Completion of the R61 phase
specific aims will provide physiologically justified functional requirements for the APENG device, refined and
validated manufacturing process, optimized prototypes and surgical procedures, and in-vivo feasibility
assessment. In addition, we will identify an industry Accelerator Partner and secure at least 25% non-Federal
cost matching of direct costs before advancing to the R33 phase. Completion of the R33 phase specific aims
will produce refined APENG design, finalized and standardized manufacturing process, and safety and efficacy
evaluations of the final product against commonly used commercial analogs through standardized in-vitro and
chronic in-vivo studies. Reaching these milestones will lay the groundwork for future larger-scale preclinical and
clinical studies and support professional development and regulatory approval of APENG. This project will also
create new knowledge in arterial and graft biomechanics that can lead to the development of other lower
extremity arterial repair devices and intervention methods offering better and more durable treatments."

The UNC-Malawi-South Africa Cancer Consortium (UMSACC) seeks to train the next generation of

be embedded within the existing, highly successful, NIH-supported research training infrastructure that UNC
has established with LMIC partners in Malawi and South Africa over the past two decades. Despite our many
training successes, a central problem for investigators in LMIC settings is the lack of dedicated career
development support and protected time to conduct research and compete for independent funding. We
propose to address this problem through a comprehensive approach to training and mentoring early-career
cancer researchers. First, we will create a strong mentorship program to support the development of at least
nine African and U.S. investigators. Mentorship will focus on design and implementation of hypothesis-driven
research, manuscript writing, and development of grants. Second, we will leverage ongoing leadership
development programs in Malawi and South Africa to develop a strong pool of research supervisors/mentors
for medical and public health trainees. Third, we will provide at least 15 mentored research grants to promising
African and U.S. investigators to support hypothesis-driven research projects and/or obtain preliminary data for
larger grant applications related to HIV-associated malignancies."
10891543,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 1: Urine sampling for HPV infection and methylation testing for cervical cancer
screening among women living with HIV in Malawi and South Africa
Cancer incidence, mortality, and disparities are projected to rise at staggering rates. It is estimated, for
example, that cancer will kill one million Africans each year by 2030, with invasive cervical cancer (ICC)
accounting for the most cancer deaths in African women. Although global policy seeks to rapidly expand
access to human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and cervical cancer screening in the coming decade,
practical efforts to eliminate cervical cancer in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain limited. This
gap leaves generations of women needlessly at risk for ICC, with HIV-positive (HIV+) women particularly
vulnerable. The need for cost-effective and scalable screening and treatment strategies to reduce ICC is
therefore substantial. There is also an urgent need for quality evidence directly applicable to HIV+ women in
LMICs, who face the highest risk of HPV infection, cervical precancer (CIN2/3), and ICC.
The central hypothesis of our proposal is that the use of self-collected samples to test for HPV infection has
the potential to increase cervical screening coverage in clinical settings where pelvic examinations are not
routinely performed. We will validate urine-based HPV testing among HIV+ women attending cervical
screening clinics at two strong research sites in Malawi and South Africa. As primary HPV screening is
highly sensitive but only moderately specific for CIN2/3 and ICC, we will also validate a novel S5 methylation
test for triage of women who screen positive for HPV.
In Aim 1, we will enroll 925 HIV+ women and evaluate high-risk HPV testing in urine, self-collected
cervicovaginal, and provider-collected cervical samples for the detection of CIN2/3 and ICC (CIN2+). We will
report HPV positivity in the 3 sample types and compare the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative
predictive values (PPV and NPV) for CIN2+ detection between the sample types. In Aim 2, we will evaluate S5
methylation as a triage test for HIV+ women with HPV positive results. For each sample collection method
(urine, self, and provider), we will calculate PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity of S5 triage testing for CIN2+.
We will also report the number of colposcopy referrals per CIN2+ case detected with and without S5 triage.
Our proposed project will be the first to validate urine-based HPV testing among HIV+ women and the first to
compare the clinical performance of S5 triage testing using urine, self, and provider-collected samples in an
LMIC setting. If successful, our findings will have broad relevance for HIV+ women in both resource-rich and
resource-poor regions worldwide, including rural and remote areas of the U.S."
10891547,"ABSTRACT: PROJECT 3: Tumor-associated biomarkers for HIV-associated Diffuse Large B-cell
Lymphoma in Malawi and South Africa
Lymphoma incidence in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is increasing due to epidemic levels of HIV infection,
population growth, and aging. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is highly associated with HIV, the
commonest lymphoma subtype among HIV-infected individuals, and the commonest cause of cancer death
among people living with HIV in high-income countries (HIC). Despite histologically similar appearances, HIV-
associated DLBCL differs biologically from DLBCL in immunocompetent populations and may also differ within
HIV-infected populations depending on the HIV immunologic and virologic environment in which they occur.
However, current diagnosis, risk stratification and therapy do not account for these differences which remain
incompletely understood, and suitable patient cohorts to overcome these challenges have historically been
lacking. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for HIV-associated DLBCL in SSA by applying promising
regionally generated biomarkers, building on our previous immunophenotypic and molecular analyses of
DLBCL from the region, to a prospective cohort of patients in Malawi and South Africa. The work will further
characterize tumor microenvironmental factors that influence tumor biology across the spectrum of HIV-
associated immune dysfunction. We hypothesize that prognostic biomarkers can be identified and
implemented in SSA to better tailor treatment for this challenging and vulnerable population. Given the
generalized HIV epidemic in the region, comparisons within specific tumor types based on HIV status are
uniquely possible in this setting. Similar studies are challenging to conduct in the US, given relatively few HIV-
positive cancers, and differences between the HIV-infected and general HIV-negative US population with
respect to age, as well as behavioral and other cancer risk factors. These efforts will be enhanced by
established collaborations with bioinformatics and sequencing core facilities, allowing the proposed research to
yield insights which inform the care of HIV-associated DLBCL worldwide. The proposed work is necessary to
understand the biological factors underlying lymphomagenesis and improve survival for HIV-associated DLBCL
in high- and low-income countries."
10891557,"Effective radiation experiments with mice require adherence to strict standards in pre- and post-irradiation care 
to minimize stress that might confound radiation responses. Since the Projects depend on shared samples, 
mouse resources in the current grant submission have been centralized in an Animal Core, rather than trying 
to replicate expertise and experiments in each of the Projects. Centralized mouse handling has a strong 
positive impact on the quality of the results from the experiments performed and allows a more streamlined 
integration of data generated across the three Projects. The Animal Core will be responsible for the following: 
 Provision of strain- and age-appropriate animals for the proposed studies. 
 Maintenance of the two CMCR mouse housing satellite facilities: VAriable Dose-rate External 137Cs 
 irradiator (VADER) and Columbia IND Neutron Facility (CINF). 
 Provision of support during experiments. 
 Coordination of distribution between the Projects of control and irradiated Non Human Primate (NHP) blood 
 samples. These blood samples will be provided to us through another unrelated project. 
 Blood immunophenotyping. 
Mice will be either acquired from approved commercial vendors or established and bred by the Core in the 
case of the INK-ATTAC transgenic mice that will be used in Projects 2 and 3 to investigate the contribution of 
senescent cells to radiation-induced lung disease. At the Satellite Facilities, the Core will be responsible for 
daily maintenance and mouse care as well as monitoring pain and distress in accordance with IACUC 
guidelines. The Core will be responsible for the administration of anesthesia and euthanasia, sample collection 
and sharing, coding and blinding and, for the NHP study, receiving all the animal biofluids pre- and post- 
irradiation to distribute between the Projects. The Animal Core will perform immunophenotyping and serial 
blood count studies to assess correlations between radiation biomarkers and the hematological nadirs. 
Immunophenotyping will also be performed from the NHP blood samples to assess baseline and cell depletion 
cell counts."
10891560,"The Biostatistics Core provides tools to enhance the rigor of all the CMCR studies.
 The Core will provide support for investigators in each Project by selecting and implementing appropriate
statistical and mathematical modeling methodologies for each experimental design. These activities include
data analysis and statistical testing. The Core will maintain constant interaction with the Projects, establishing a
productive “cycle”, where data analysis results enhance our understanding of the biological effects of complex
radiation exposures, and improve experimental design and hypothesis generation and testing. Specifically, the
Core will implement techniques such as parametric regression with linear or generalized linear models,
information theoretic multimodel inference, and ensemble machine learning with gradient boosting and random
forests. To analyze multidimensional transcriptomics and metabolomics data sets, dimension reduction and
robustness testing strategies will be utilized. Most of these techniques will be performed using the R
programming language. Standard packages will be used in combination with custom-written code.
 One of the aims of the Biostatistics Core will be quantitative radiation dose reconstructions based on
biological data such as cytogenetics, transcriptomics and metabolomics biomarker levels. Biomarker signature
modulation by dose rate and biological system will also be studied in detail. This task will be performed by
analyzing the data from experiments with different dose rate scenarios in different biological systems, including
ex vivo blood vs. in vivo irradiation of the same species, and different mammalian species.
 Other important aims include investigation of biomarker signatures under complex radiation exposures like
partial body and neutron+photon mixtures. Preliminary data suggest that analysis of cytogenetic damage (e.g.
micronuclei) distributions per cell by machine learning is a promising approach for detecting partial body and
neutron exposures. These methodologies will be developed and refined further for the three biomarkers types
we have developed.
 The Biostatistics Core will also be involved in prediction of radiation-induced late lung injury (pneumonitis),
and in quantification of biomarker correlations with post-irradiation blood count data. Accomplishing these aims
is important for understanding the connections between the biomarkers measured by the Projects and the
ultimate radiation-induced adverse outcomes like organ injury and death.
 The Core will actively seek to stimulate synergy between all Projects by developing methods for
integrating cytogenetics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data, using the complementary strengths of these
different biomarker classes (e.g. different times-to-result, different dose response shapes such as concave vs.
convex). Decision trees will be utilized to determine which combination of biomarkers and biodosimetry
approaches is optimally useful for dealing with mass casualty events involving ionizing radiation."
10891562,"Project 1 focuses on fully-automated ultra high-throughput biodosimetry, made possible by the RABiT-II
approach of complete automation of sample preparation and imaging in commercial robotic platforms. Its goals
are “Assay Development”, “Beyond Simple Exposures”, “Beyond Model Systems” and “Optimized Biomarker
Integration”, all motivated by the very wide variety of different exposure scenarios and countermeasure needs.
Assay Development: The goal here is a major decrease in time-to-result of the high-throughput RABiT-II
assays. While throughputs of the micronucleus and dicentric assays in our automated systems are extremely
high (>10,000 samples per day), these assays require ~54 hours for cell culture. A 6-hour Premature
Chromosome Condensation (PCC) dicentric assay with completely automated sample preparation and imaging
in multiwell plates is being developed, and will result in a major reduction in time-to-result.
Beyond Simple Exposures: There are a wide variety of different exposure scenarios to which individuals will
be exposed after an IND, including mixed neutron+photon exposure, very high dose rate, variable low dose
rate and partial body exposure. This CMCR uses unique irradiation facilities for each of these scenarios, and
these will be used to assess whether the quantitative high-throughput biomarkers that were developed using
photons at intermediate dose rates can reconstruct the dose in these very different scenarios - and also
whether the biomarkers can be used to identify these different exposure scenarios.
Beyond Model Systems: addresses issues which underlie all radiation biodosimetry / biomarker studies, but
have not yet been systematically addressed, either for photons or for neutrons. Radiation biodosimetry is
intended to assess in-vivo human exposures, but biodosimetric assay development / testing is typically
performed either with ex-vivo irradiated human blood or in-vivo in animals. Thus a major knowledge gap exists
regarding the validity of transferring biodosimetry results to in-vivo human exposures. The in-vivo animal 
human extrapolation cannot be directly evaluated, and neither can the human ex-vivo  in-vivo extrapolation.
So the goal here is to separate out and address independently the ex-vivo  in-vivo issue (in mice and in NHP)
and the NHP  human issue (ex-vivo, humans vs. NHP), both for photons and for neutrons.
Optimized Biomarker Integration: The three different biomarker systems investigated in this CMCR program
(Project 1: cytogenetics; Project 2: transcriptomics, Project 3: metabolomics) all reflect different balances of
capabilities in terms of throughput, time-to-result, signal lifetime, dose reconstruction, exposure scenario
identification and individual radiosensitivity prediction. Our common goal is to identify their optimal integrated
usage in each of a wide variety of different possible large-scale exposure scenarios. As results emerge from
this Project, they will be “fed” to the Biostatistics Core as input to optimized decision trees to determine which
assay, or combination of assays will be most effective in each different radiation event scenario."
10891565,"Project 2 Summary
 Project 2 addresses transcriptomic signatures of radiation exposure and injury in the following themes:
 Beyond Simple Exposures: Gene expression signatures will be tested for reconstruction of dose in
complex exposure scenarios that mimic those expected to be encountered in an actual radiation / nuclear
event, such as a ground-burst detonation of an improvised nuclear device in an urban area. In such an event,
exposures will be complicated by the very high dose rate of exposure during the initial flash, decreasing dose
rate from fallout, and the presence of neutrons and partial shielding determined in part by the urban
architecture. Unique exposure facilities will be used to mimic these realistic scenarios and to test dose
reconstruction using a reference transcriptomic signature. Signature genes will be replaced or added to
improve both dose reconstruction performance and characterization of complex exposures.
 Beyond Dose: To address the late effects of radiation, another transcriptomic signature has been
developed that can predict death or survival following photon-induced pneumonitis. The impact of mixed
neutron+photon exposures on such lung injury is not well known, however, and will now be characterized, with
the outcome-predictive transcriptomic signature being tested for mixed neutron+photon exposures. The
contribution of senescent cells to the development of pneumonitis and the expression of outcome predictive
genes after photon or neutron+photon exposures will also be evaluated.
 Beyond Model Systems: Biodosimetry is ultimately intended for use with in-vivo human exposures, but
assay development typically uses either ex-vivo irradiated human blood or in-vivo irradiated mice or non-
human primates. A major gap in knowledge thus exists, regarding the application of results from experimental
models to humans. Direct comparison of ex-vivo and in-vivo exposures to both photons and neutrons will be
conducted in both non-human primate and mouse models, and the accuracy of dose reconstruction using
transcriptomic signatures will be assessed. These studies will include juvenile, adult, and old mice, to quantify
the possible impact of age on dose reconstruction, and to test if the ex-vivo model reflects age-specific
differences seen in vivo. Non-human primate to human extrapolation will also be addressed, comparing results
from ex-vivo neutron irradiated non-human primate and human blood samples to develop and test cross-
species conversion approaches for dose reconstruction after neutron exposure.
 Optimized Biomarker Integration: Data from the biodosimetry approaches of all three Projects (Project 1:
cytogenetics, Project 2: gene expression, Project 3: metabolomics) will be analyzed in conjunction to determine
the relative strengths of each approach, and to develop decision trees for guiding the application of
biodosimetry methodologies in real world situations."
10891566,"Project 3 focuses on the development of metabolomic signatures of past radiation exposure in biofluids
such as urine and serum. These biomarkers are particularly useful because of the potential for non invasive
sample acquisition and the long metabolomic signal lifetime - days or weeks after exposure. Metabolomic
signatures developed to date have been predictive of both dose and late health outcome. The themes here are
“Beyond Simple Exposures”, “Beyond Dose”, “Beyond Model Systems” and “Optimized Biomarker Integration”,
which are motivated by the variety of different exposure scenarios and countermeasure needs.
Beyond Simple Exposures: While most radiation biodosimetry studies have involved photons at intermediate
dose rates, realistic exposure scenarios to which individuals will be exposed after an IND may include: mixed
neutron+photon exposure, very high dose rates, variable low dose rates, and partial body exposure. This
CMCR uses unique irradiation facilities designed to simulate these exposures, and these will be used to
assess if a reference metabolomic signature can reconstruct the dose - or if additional metabolites are required
to identify different exposure scenarios.
Beyond Dose: Metabolomic biomarkers have been useful not only for reconstructing past radiation dose but
also for predicting photon-induced pulmonary death. Here these predictive capabilities will be assessed
following mixed neutron+photon exposures. Mechanistically, a focus will be on radiation-induced senescent
cell signaling, which is a likely player in the development of late pulmonary injury. The contribution of radiation-
induced senescent cell signaling will be evaluated in photon vs. mixed neutron+photon induced late lung
injuries, and how it affects the predictive signature of these injuries.
Beyond Model Systems: In that most biodosimetry studies are of necessity conducted in animal models, this
theme addresses the link between metabolomic biomarkers of radiation exposure in animals vs. humans.
Although many relevant exposures cannot be directly investigated in humans, samples from photon-exposed
TBI patients can help guide the translation of biodosimetry assays from animal models. A very large
metabolomic database from TBI patients, mice, and NHPs will be analyzed to test the hypothesis that there is
a common radiation-responsive metabolomics signature across all three species.
Optimized Biomarker Integration: The three different biomarker systems in this CMCR program
cytogenetics, gene expression, and metabolomics reflect different balances of capabilities in terms of
throughput, time-to-result, dose reconstruction, exposure scenario identification and radiosensitivity prediction.
Our common goal is to identify their optimal integrated usage in a wide variety of different large-scale exposure
scenarios. As results emerge from this Project, they will be used as input to optimize decision trees to
determine which assay, or combination of assays, will be most effective in each radiation event scenario."

 A major goal of genetics and evolutionary biology is to understand how changes in genotype affect
phenotype. Genetic variants affecting fitness are especially informative for investigating evolution, since natural
selection acts exclusively on these variants. By identifying specific variants that influence fitness, we can begin
to understand the molecular mechanisms driving the incredible adaptations of all organisms to their
environments.
 We recently developed an approach that allows us to edit genomes with unprecedented efficiency
(~100%) and throughput, and precisely measure each edit’s effect on fitness. In our initial screen, we
measured the fitness effects of 16,000 natural genetic variants differing between two strains of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. In this pilot experiment, we measured the effects of each variant in isolation, in a single condition.
We found that nearly all strong fitness effects were from promoter variants, rather than protein-coding regions,
and these were especially enriched at transcription factor binding sites.
 Here we propose to utilize this powerful system to investigate two concepts of fundamental importance:
the role of selection in shaping genetic variation in Aim 1, and gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions in Aim
2. This project will reveal key insights into the evolutionary process that would be unapproachable without our
high-throughput precision genome editing technology."

Alcohol abuse and related diseases exact a staggering health and economic toll, and thus there is a dire
need for novel therapeutic approaches. The hormone FGF21, which is rapidly and robustly induced in liver
in response to ethanol exposure, is an exciting new pharmaceutical candidate. FGF21 acts on the brain to
suppress alcohol consumption and to stimulate water drinking. In this application, we propose that FGF21
mediates these protective effects by acting directly on neurons expressing the neuropeptide, neurotensin,
which is a well-established regulator of ethanol and water intake. We further propose that liver-derived
FGF21 also protects against ethanol-induced hypothermia and liver injury by activating the sympathetic
nervous system and stimulating thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. We will test these hypotheses in a
series of experiments that employ our unique collection of genetically-engineered mouse models, including
mice selectively lacking FGF21’s obligate co-receptor -Klotho in neurotensin neurons. We anticipate that
these studies will provide important insights into the tissues and underlying mechanisms whereby FGF21
protects against ethanol-induced toxicity. Moreover, since FGF21 is already in clinical trials for metabolic
disease-related indications, these studies will aid in determining whether FGF21 can be repurposed
pharmaceutically for treating alcohol abuse and its associated pathologies."

Families of children with limited English proficiency (LEP) have been systematically excluded from autism
spectrum disorder (ASD) research, yet they likely experience greater barriers to care. As a result, little is
known about what factors are associated with these disparities, and how they differ across populations and
settings. Because of this lack of data, developing data-driven strategies to address disparities for children with
ASD and LEP can be a challenge. Thus, we propose to address this critical gap by conducting a sequential
mixed methods study to understand what patient, provider, and structural factors are associated with
disparities in care for families with LEP. First, in collaboration with a team of experts in LEP survey research,
we propose the largest ever diverse, multi-lingual national survey (n=2730) of families of underserved children
with ASD to both validate measures (e.g., parent stress, stigma, discrimination) in five languages (Spanish,
Haitian-Creole, Vietnamese, Mandarin, English) and use those measures to understand disparities in care
between and across populations. The survey will be embedded within the Autism Cares Network (ACN), a
national network of 20 large, geographically diverse hospital systems focused on improving care for ASD. We
will then use qualitative interviews to better understand survey findings. Finally, based on best practices from
the field of implementation science, we will use rigorous consensus methods to place findings in context and
make recommendations for data and measure use, as well as policy decisions. Our results will impact the field
by validating measures to be used in future studies of ASD interventions – from treatment trials to policy
initiatives – as well as by producing data to be used as future intervention targets in disparities reduction
efforts. Our aims align directly with the NIMH’s Strategic Plan to reduce disparities in treatment of ASD."

Forty million Americans live with kidney disease and this number is projected to increase with rising rates of
CKD comorbid conditions, including diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, superimposed on an aging patient
population. A tremendous financial burden is imparted by dialysis therapy and kidney transplantation for end-
stage CKD. At present, however, there are limited tools in existence to predict the progression of AKI and
CKD, and development of therapies has been disappointingly restricted. The overall objective of this
application is to establish the Mount Sinai Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) recruitment site in
support of the larger consortium’s tissue interrogation and phenotyping activities. There is a tremendous need
to utilize human kidney tissue as a research tool for the identification of AKI and CKD disease markers to
elucidate molecular pathways that contribute to kidney disease development and progression. We have
proposed three Specific Aims: Aim 1 will establish a robust system of patient centered oversight to recruit
diverse patients into a kidney biopsy cohort while maintaining the highest standards of safety, quality and
ethical research conduct. In Aim 2 we will recruit and retain a spectrum of patients with CKD in response to
KPMP priorities. This includes leveraging existing institutional risk stratification tools and resources to identify
and recall patients at risk for CKD progression due to diabetes, hypertension, prior COVID-19 infection and
apolipoprotein L1 associated disease. Aim 3 will recruit and retain patients with AKI as well as those at high
risk for AKI identified by a machine learning algorithm. These Aims overseen by a stakeholder board and
executed by an experienced multidisciplinary team, will integrate with the KPMP consortium to accomplish its
transformative aims."

The brain is composed of unique cell types, such as neurons and astrocytes, that actively coordinate to enable
higher order functions including learning, memory, and cognition. Even slight deviances in the molecular or
cellular states of the brain can result in debilitating neurological symptoms whose severity, treatment course,
and overall treatment outcome vary widely from patient to patient. This level of complexity likely contributes to
promising therapeutics failing within clinical trials and, thus, requires further exploration. To date, most of our
foundational knowledge of neuroscience stems from a neuron-centric focus. Recent literature has demonstrated
that other cell types, such as astrocytes, may participate in signaling and communication beyond their known
passive, supporting roles. As such, exploring the molecular and cellular diversity of astrocytes in their native
tissue context will help us better understand neurological function and dysfunction, particularly in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Because of the inherent spatial and chemical complexity in physiological processes and
interconnectedness of cells, we will develop workflows for integrating multiresolution and multimodal imaging
methods for the characterization of spatial relationships among cell phenotypes in AD compared to healthy
controls. To investigate the molecular diversity within the hippocampus, we are employing a combination of mass
spectrometry imaging (MSI) and multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) to gain rich metabolomic information
that is associated with cell type and state. MSI can detect hundreds to thousands of endogenous molecules
while maintaining their spatial distributions. While chemically informative, these datasets are often difficult to
correlate directly to cell type or functional state without an orthogonal technique, such as immunohistochemistry.
Because the number of cell types exceed what can be probed by traditional IF approaches within a single
experiment, we have chosen to incorporate MxIF, using Cell DIVE, to increase the number of imageable targets
compared to traditional fluorescence microscopy. By staining for traditional cell-specific markers, we can use
MxIF to connect metabolomic profiles uncovered using MSI to functionally important cellular neighborhoods in
AD. Ultimately, we will establish small molecule, lipid, and cellular spatial differences between hippocampal
regions of AD and control subjects using high spatial resolution MALDI mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and
highly multiplexed immunofluorescence (MxIF) (aim 1) as well as integrate multimodal data sets to examine the
molecular neighborhoods associated with typical and atypical cellular neighborhoods surrounding astrocytes
within AD (aim 2). By conclusion of these two aims, we will have developed workflows for integrating MSI and
MxIF on the cortex from human AD and control subjects to identify molecular and cellular phenotypes and
characterize their spatial relationships within the diseased microenvironment. Ultimately, exploring the cellular
and molecular architecture of astrocytes in AD is paramount for understanding this disease and establishing
effective therapeutics."

The majority of validated social-communication measures for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
were designed to behaviorally phenotype or diagnose this core symptom domain and not to detect change
over time. The lack of validated outcome measures has somewhat stifled intervention research efforts as well
as early interventionists’ ability to monitor the effects of their programs on children’s social-communicative
outcomes. It has become difficult to sort out whether non-significant treatment effects are a result of truly
ineffective interventions, or rather poorly validated measures for this population. We know that the early,
foundational social-communication and language skills of children with ASD predict their functioning into
adolescence and even adulthood, with functional use of language by age 5 being one of the best predictors of
long-term prognosis. As such, clinicians have begun to focus their efforts on improving children’s social-
communication and language skills using both developmental and behavioral interventions as well as
pharmaceutical treatments. In reviewing these treatment trials, it is clear there is a range of intervention
success and even more clear that we lack a consistent set of outcome measures for the social-communication
symptom domain. Our group has been working to validate measures of key social-communication and
language skills and are able to draw from a wealth of prior psychometric data to adapt and validate a brief
observational measure that can be easily used within clinical trials as well as within routine care and practice.
We propose to adapt and psychometrically validate a measure of social-communication and language skills for
young children, ages 12 – 60 months, preliminarily or formally diagnosed with ASD. Specifically, we plan to
validate the Early Communication Indicator for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ECI-ASD) using a robust and
representative multisite sample of well-characterized children with ASD (n = 400). The current version of the
ECI is norm-referenced and allows for progress monitoring, which means the measure can be used in a
formative, data-driven fashion to monitor children’s intervention progress and make changes if children are not
improving, but it also can provide summative outcome data. In addition, the current measure can be scored live
using a mobile app. Currently, no other current social-communication measure specifically designed for
children with ASD easily allows for ongoing intervention progress monitoring, data visualization, and live
scoring, which will make the adapted ECI-ASD a unique outcome measurement tool. Further, the ECI-ASD will
provide the ability to enter data into an online platform to compare the progress of children with ASD to
normative data and this represents a sorely needed and clear innovation above current measurement
approaches. The expected deliverable is a novel outcome measure of key social-communication and language
skills that is psychometrically sound, minimally burdensome to administer and score, and sensitive to the
incremental change expected for young children with ASD."
10897692,"Estimated 15,000 Veterans suffer a stroke each year. Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability in the US.
New strokes cost an estimated $111 million for acute inpatient care, $75 million for post-acute inpatient care,
and $88 million for follow-up care in the first six months post-stroke in VHA. Yet, more than two thirds of stroke
survivors have persistent hand impairment that significantly diminishes their abilities to perform activities of daily
living. While it is known that training for healthy movement patterns is critical especially early on in rehabilitation,
precise control of multiple finger joints simultaneously is not possible in current therapy. Controlling finger joint
movements is challenging since the human hand has more than 20 degrees of freedom (DOF) densely located
in a small space. There exist robots for hand rehabilitation that train for gross grasping and finger individuation.
However, current robots have limited DOF and cannot control finger joint torques, so these systems are unable
to deliver training that ensures healthy movement patterns. Thus, there is lack of tools for delivering training
that ensures healthy movement pattern and prevents compensatory movements. With a lack of joint-level training
tool, patients are either left with compensatory patterns, or worse, have no recovery of hand movements. With
the long-term goal of improving hand rehabilitation, we have designed a robotic tool called the Maestro hand
exoskeleton. Maestro’s design features enable delivery of versatile interventions for patients with a wide range
of impairments in various stages of recovery. This innovation represents a substantial advancement from current
rehabilitation robotic tools by providing high-intensity, task-based training with real time modulation of assistance
and difficulty level ensuring patient participation and task saliency. The objective of this project is to develop
novel controllers with promising neurological basis for training correct movement patterns in stroke patients.
Specifically, (1) compensation avoidance (CA) controller will apply joint torques to push the patients away from
the compensatory joint coordination, only interfering with the movements once the subject initiates a
compensatory movement strategy. (2) Task assistance (TA) controller will apply assistive joint torques to directly
help stroke patients achieve finger tasks with correct coordination. For both controllers, the torques in the finger
joints will be modulated to match the individual patient’s ability, impairment, and progression throughout the
training via robot control program. Four and nine Veteran subacute stroke survivors with moderate to severe hand
impairment and with some ability to move fingers will participate in the testing for Aim1 and Aim 2, respectively.
Aim 1 will involve one session and Aim 2 will involve four sessions of experimentation for each participant. Aim 1:
Develop and determine feasibility of CA and TA controllers. Hypothesis: CA and TA controllers are feasible, as
seen by (1) patient safety and (2) abilities for TA and CA controller to move the finger joints toward the desired
trajectories and away from compensatory coordination, respectively. Aim 2: Determine feasibility of training
using CA and TA controllers in subacute stroke. Hypothesis: Joint coordination will improve over a training
session more with CA controller for patients with moderate impairment, and more with TA controller for patients
with severe impairment. Impact: This research will develop a novel training tool to improve finger joint
coordination, thereby addressing the unmet need in the current rehabilitation. Future studies will use the
developed Maestro controllers to elucidate underlying principles of practice-related neuro-recovery post stroke
per impairment level and determine the effectiveness of Maestro on improving finger joint coordination and hand
function. As a result, this research is expected to enhance hand function, contributing to improved independence
and quality of life for Veterans with stroke."
10897706,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Maintaining normal activity of lysosomes is essential for human health, as evidenced by the many rare
disorders caused by defects in lysosomal biogenesis and function. How lysosomal dysfunction leads to the
tissue-specific phenotypes associated with lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) is poorly understood. Our long-
term goal is to define these pathogenic mechanisms, and use this information to identify new therapeutic
strategies. Our recent efforts have focused on the investigation of secreted proteases as key initiators of
disease in mucolipidosis II (MLII). In MLII, the enzyme (GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase) that synthesizes the
carbohydrate-based tag needed for receptor-mediated lysosomal targeting is missing. This causes cathepsin
proteases to be secreted outside the cell where they become activated. Using powerful zebrafish tools, we
established that these secreted cathepsin proteases alter the key signaling events that control normal cartilage
and cardiac development. The current proposal will extend these studies and test the central hypothesis that
cathepsin-mediated mechanisms are pathogenic drivers across multiple LSDs with different etiologies. This
effort is premised on observations that demonstrate: i) cathepsin activity is altered in other LSDs including
sialidosis (NEU1) and MPSIVA (GALNS), ii) increased lysosomal exocytosis is associated with altered
cathepsin activity, and iii) extracellular cathepsin K (Ctsk) activity is modulated by specific glycosaminoglycans
(GAGs). We will use a unique and innovative set of tools in the zebrafish system to investigate the protease-
mediated pathogenesis in cartilage, with the goal of identifying novel disease mechanisms for these LSDs. We
believe this will point to new modes of treatment for disorders like MLII and sialidosis (where no approved
therapies exist), and for MPSIVA (where enzyme replacement has limited efficacy in cartilage and bone).
Understanding how extracellular cathepsin activity impacts different tissues is also crucial since there are a
growing number of proposed therapies aimed at increasing lysosomal exocytosis as a means of resolving
lysosomal storage. Such therapies may positively impact certain tissues but release of lysosomal enzymes in
other tissues may have unexpected and detrimental consequences. To address the central hypothesis, we will
profile cathepsin activity and TGFß related growth factor signaling in sialidosis and MPSIVA zebrafish (AIM 1)
and address whether changes in the abundance or type of GAGs present can tune this protease-dependent
pathogenic cascade (AIM 2). Next, we will define the extent to which lysosomal exocytosis drives cartilage
pathology in these disorders and ask if modulating exocytosis improves or exacerbates phenotypes (AIM 3).
We will also investigate the neuronal pathogenesis associated with NUS1 (NogoB receptor; NgBR) deficiency,
a newly characterized disorder with lysosomal dysfunction and cholesterol storage. Here we will ask if the
neuronal phenotypes stem from loss of NgBR or Niemann-Pick type C2 (Npc2) in specific cell types, and
whether cholesterol accumulation impairs myelination and increases lysosomal exocytosis. (AIM 4)."

This is a proposal to establish a Nonhuman Primate Developmental Genotype-Tissue Expression (NHP dGTEx)
Research Center, developed by scientists at the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC), MIT, the
Broad Institute, and Yale University. This Center will provide a vital resource to the NIH dGTEx program by
generating a two-species nonhuman primate (NHP) resource with numerous benefits, including access to
prenatal developmental stages and a basis for evolutionary analysis of developmental expression programs.
For this proposal we have elected to generate data from two species: Macaca mulata (rhesus macaque), an old-
world monkey, and Callithirix jacchus (common marmoset), a new-world monkey. We will create a tissue
resource of 30 different tissues types sampled across 6 developmental stages in both species, profiling a total
of 198 animals in the process. Using the reference tissue resource, we will perform transcriptome sequencing
and other genomic analysis of single-cell and bulk tissues. To form a robust basis for analysis of RNA-seq, we
begin by generating full-transcript sequencing from a panel of tissues of each species, which will be used for
annotating gene models. For each species we will then generate bulk RNA-sequencing of 30 tissues each from
12 individuals, sampled from 6 timepoints. We propose to use multiome snRNA+ATAC sequencing to generate
a first generation single-cell atlas for each species, covering 20 total tissues, with a special emphasis on the
brain. These RNA-seq resources will be complemented with strategic epigenetic profiling by CHIP-seq and Hi-
C for annotation of functional elements. Finally, specialized techniques will be used to generate data from the
smallest prenatal stages. We will adapt the Broad Institute’s GTEx RNA-seq analysis pipeline to accommodate
species-specific information and biology, and use the resulting pipelines to analyze the bulk RNA-seq and
perform eQTL mapping. We propose to develop a public, interactive platform for the single-cell atlases that
enables exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and comparison across species. We will use our expertise
in comparative genomics to identify evolutionarily constrained expression patterns and functional elements, as
well as human-specific features, and investigate the relationship of these features to human disease. We will
create a searchable inventory of all NHP tissues sampled in the project, and standardize NHP data types to
match the human dGTEx specifications. To facilitate communicationabout resource availabilityand experimental
results, the Center will integrate the NHP data and tissue inventory database into the primary dGTEx portal to
be generated and maintained by the Broad Institute. The successful completionof the project will create a unique
resource comprising a comprehensive NHP biospecimen repository spanning early prenatal to adult life, and a
corresponding genomic database to be made widely accessible which will provide the groundwork and
infrastructure for multiple future research studies."
10895840,"Despite expansions in the number of insured individuals and the increased availability of
treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), over 70% of adults with OUD do not receive care. Barriers to
accessing OUD care exist at the individual and structural level. Considerable gaps persist in our
understanding of these access barriers as they can vary by sociodemographic and geographic factors.
Further, OUD frequently co-occurs with depression. Not only are individuals with OUD and co-occurring
depression (“dually diagnosed”) harder to treat, but if left untreated, they are at greater risk of adverse
health outcomes compared to those with OUD or depression alone. Treatment pathways for both OUD
and depression in those dually diagnosed are particularly complicated and understudied. There is a
critical need to develop a holistic 360-degree view of OUD care in this population. Such a view is
necessary to provide context for understanding determinants of access to care and treatment utilization
and to develop nuanced interventions for improving equity in care.
 Thus, I aim to accomplish two distinct goals connected via the principle of providing a whole-
person view while advancing health equity. The specific aims are to: develop and validate an OUD-
specific Resource Index (OUDRI) (Aim 1); examine, characterize and compare distinct trajectories of
antidepressant treatment and medications for OUD (MOUD) combinations among publicly-insured
individuals with OUD and depression (Aim 2); and evaluate the association between the treatment
trajectories identified in Aim 2 and OUD-related outcomes and depression-related outcomes (Aim 3).
The research strategy for Aim 1 is to use publicly-available datasets to generate a composite index that
quantifies the potential to access resources for OUD treatment. The research strategy for Aims 2 and 3
is to use a national sample of adult Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD and depression from 2010 through
2018. I will link the OUDRI developed in the first Aim to the claims dataset to contextualize each
treatment utilization trajectory and associated outcomes.
 The expected study impact is that it will improve our understanding of the totality of care and
health outcomes for people with OUD and those dually diagnosed with depression. This research
addresses the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)'s priority populations by targeting
Medicaid enrollees with OUD, which includes low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations
needing chronic care. This dissertation addresses AHRQ's research priority areas to harness data to
improve the quality of OUD care and outcomes by identifying optimal longitudinal treatment pathways in
the dually diagnosed population. Consequently, with its fundamental focus on achieving equity in OUD
care delivery, this project is responsive to SEN NOT-HS-23-013."

the potency of action levers at the individual level. Among SES- and race/ethnicity-related health disparities in
the U.S., 11 preventable conditions cause >50% of mortality. Further, our preliminary modeling work suggests
that only 9 prevention goals are required to attain 40% mortality reduction from these 11 conditions, resulting in
20% mortality reduction overall, because of interdependencies and common pathways. For example, alcohol
use disorder and/or heavy drinking impacts not only liver failure, but also behavioral consequences such as
sexual risk-taking and medication nonadherence.
However, attaining 20% mortality reduction would require a radical transformation of preventive care, such as
what we propose, focused on personalization, navigation, and compensation. Personalization means
maximizing individual-level benefit by modulating intensity of screening, frequency of screening; and intensity
or duration of response; navigation means reducing barriers posed by fragmentation of health and social
systems; and compensation means offsetting dependent care, time costs, and travel costs.
The post-R34-goal is a N=15,000 5-year RCT which would have adequate power to test the hypothesis of 20%
mortality reduction from personalization, navigation, and compensation. This proposed R34 is preparatory for
that goal, and focuses especially on alcohol use disorder and heavy drinking, HIV risk, and risk for
cardiovascular disease."

Population genomic data carry a detailed record of evolutionary history, but this record is simultaneously
impacted by multiple evolutionary forces making interpretation extremely challenging. Methods development
and increasing accessibility of large-scale genomic datasets have led to more powerful strategies to
disentangle the effects of natural selection and identify loci underlying recent adaptation. Yet we still lack
understanding of many aspects of adaptive processes, including the types of genetic variation (e.g., point
mutations vs. structural variants), numbers of loci, and selective regimes by which it occurs. Over the next five
years, research in the Leffler lab aims to probe the genetics of adaptation by developing new approaches and
datasets to study loci under recent pathogen-driven selective pressures in humans and non-human primates.
Pathogens have a severe impact on host fitness and survival and consequently are a driving force for
evolutionary change and an effective model system for learning about selective processes. We will combine
approaches in computational, population and evolutionary genomics to explore a range of signatures that host-
pathogen interactions leave in our genomes, organized in three project areas. First, we will characterize
population genomic variation in the Arabian Peninsula, developing a new sequence-based approach to identify
adaptive gene flow post-admixture and test for enrichment related to infectious disease, particularly focusing
on blood group variation. Second, we will analyze copy number variation in paralogous gene clusters,
developing new methods for inference of both copy number and selection, in order to test whether they may be
frequent targets of pathogen-driven selection. Finally, we will investigate evolutionary genomics of wild
macaques in southeast Asia. We will assess evidence for pathogen-driven selection by comparing allele
frequencies in populations with a range of pathogen burdens and different levels of admixture with closely
related species living in the absence of these pathogens. Together, the results of these research projects will
provide new tools, datasets, and significant insight into the impact of host-pathogen co-evolution across
populations, gene families, and primate species."

High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) are a group of viral pathogens that infect and replicate in keratinocytes
in the stratified squamous epithelium (SE) of the skin and mucosa, and are known to cause nearly 5% of all
human cancers. HPV infection is highly prevalent, with >40 million currently infected individuals in the United
States alone. Prevention of HPV-associated malignancies is limited by a lack of antivirals, and development of
these therapeutics is in turn limited by the lack of knowledge on virus-host interactions preceding and leading to
carcinogenesis in SE. The differentiation program of SE plays an important role in supporting the HPV life cycle.
However, identification of distinct cell populations responsible for supporting this progression had been limited
by the lack of single-cell resolution tools to define such populations. In a recent study, single-cell RNA sequencing
was utilized to identify and compare keratinocytes populations present in HPV-naïve and HPV-infected SE. A
novel keratinocyte cell population enriched in HPV-infected epithelium was identified, and termed HPV-induced
differentiation dissonant epithelial non-conventional (HIDDEN) cells. These cells form a novel cellular
compartment on the surface of HPV-infected, but not uninfected epithelium, and are implicated in carcinogenesis.
The Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) is a part of a core HIDDEN signature and is independently
correlated with adverse patient outcomes in cervical squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs).
ERBB2 can be clinically targeted in other cancers (e.g., breast cancer), and pre-clinical studies have suggested
cooperative regulation between ERBB2 and HPV. However, the relationship between HPV and ERBB2 in the
context of its relevance for the HPV life cycle and resulting SCC-related pathologies remains unexplored, and
such studies require 3D models of SE. Based on preliminary data and the literature, in this proposal it is
hypothesized that HPV infection enhances expression and activation of ERBB2 in the surface HIDDEN cell
compartment, and that ERBB2 signaling promotes HPV pathologies in SE. To test this hypothesis, HPV+ and
HPV– 3D organotypic epithelial rafts will be utilized to spatially resolve ERBB2 expression, activation, and
downstream signaling, and define the viral gene responsible for ERBB2 upregulation (Aim 1). Rafts will also be
utilized to define whether ERBB2 is required for HIDDEN formation, viral genome copy number and expression,
and HPV-driven pathologies, using genetic inhibition of ERBB2 and FDA-approved drugs (Aim 2). The results
will determine whether ERBB2 signaling promotes the HPV viral life cycle and dependent pathologies, and
whether clinically relevant HPV phenotypes can be suppressed via existing FDA-approved drugs for the possible
prevention of HPV-related cancer types."

 There is an urgent need to increase the numbers and diversity of prepared graduates joining the biomedical
workforce through systematic and impactful evidence-based approaches that follow scientific practices. Florida
International University's Project iCREATE (investigating Career & Research Experience Access Through
Evidence) will address the lack of diversity in biomedical careers by designing, implementing and testing
innovative interventions; as well as investigating the effect of high-impact practices (e.g., different research
experience formats and career development opportunities) on students' career goals, career strategies, and key
student career intent and action outcomes. FIU is an urban Hispanic-serving research-intensive (R1) public
institution with over 58,000 students, 80% of which are from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical
workforce. iCREATE centers on generating evidence for two scalable interventions that will leverage FIU's
extensive expertise in student success, diversity, equity, and inclusion and focus on programming that transforms
students' access to biomedical research experiences and career awareness and preparation. iCREATE aims to
1) develop and implement the following interventions: Careers+, a workshop for students focused on career
development strategies and biomedical career awareness, and CURE+ which expands a one semester CURE
into a two-semester advanced course-based research experience; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
interventions and current research experiences available to select students at our institution; and 3) perform a
qualitative longitudinal study of undergraduates’ development of career goals and strategies and the impact of
research experiences and career development opportunities on student career goal trajectories. iCREATE will
advance our understanding of best-practices in preparing a diverse biomedical workforce by 1) developing and
testing evidence-based programs, thus, laying the groundwork for implementing similar efforts in life science
curricula to increase minority representation in the biomedical workforce; 2) conducting comparative analyses
across research experience formats, and across student demographics, to directly compare the impact of various
experiences on student outcomes; 3) focusing on the impact of research experiences and career development
opportunities on students from underrepresented backgrounds, an area that is significantly understudied, and 4)
following students longitudinally to comprehensively understand how students develop career strategies and
factors that trigger the intent and actions to pursue a career in biomedical research."

Severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) is an immunodeficiency that leads to severe, often life-threatening,
infections in patients with both congenital and acquired forms of neutropenia. Despite granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor therapy, patients remain at long term, often life-long, risk of serious infections and additional
comorbidities. The Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) was established in 1994 to
study the natural history and clinical consequences of SCN and its treatment. Based on the research resources
of the Registry, SCNIR investigators have published 255 journal articles, and 41 reviews and book chapters
related to SCN. The SCNIR has provided evidence-based clinical guidance, advanced our understanding of
neutrophil biology, and broadly informed the care of neutropenia and immunodeficiencies.
Scientific technology developments have opened new opportunities to investigate SCN biology. Ongoing
evolution of clinical medicine and diagnostics requires continued reassessment of natural history, treatments,
and outcomes. The objective of the SCNIR is to provide a platform to leverage innovations in database
science, molecular and computational biology, patient-reported outcomes, and other advances in
basic and clinical research to enable discovery of new treatments and inform medical management.
This project builds on the history of productive collaborations within and outside the SCNIR to expand available
NIAID resources and provide a model for the study of other immunodeficiencies and rare diseases. Our
SPECIFIC AIMS are:
Aim 1: Transition the SCNIR database to a hybrid model at Boston Children’s Hospital We will transition
SCNIR operations to Boston, with a hybrid data collection system engaging both physicians and patients;
collect and analyze patient-reported outcomes for SCN; and develop a pilot project in natural language
processing for data extraction and entry.
Aim 2: Generate clinically annotated genomic datasets for translational research in SCN We will characterize
the germline genomic features of chronic neutropenia for the study of genetic interactions, and novel genetic
causes of SCN by the research community; characterize the somatic mutational landscape of SCN; and
provide resources for innovative translational research and clinical trials.
Aim 3: Provide resources and outreach for education, recruitment, and retention.
The SCNIR will engage patients, families, and medical providers to provide education and promote retention
and will share expertise and foster collaborations with related patient advocacy and research groups.
Continued operation of this longstanding, productive registry will permit otherwise unfeasible long-term
assessments of SCN natural history, generate resources for both clinical and scientific research investigators,
and provide up-to-date educational resources and outreach to medical and patient communities."

 Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is characterized by central nervous system hyperactivity that
occurs when an infant experiences withdrawal from maternal opioid use at birth. Rates of NAS in the United
States have skyrocketed amidst the opioid epidemic. Assessment and clinical management of NAS rely on
subjective symptom scales, which may contribute to the prolonged hospital stays and poor neuro-
developmental outcomes associated with NAS. Enhancing our knowledge about the molecular factors that
regulate the biologic response to opioid withdrawal in developing infants will provide an opportunity to create
objective clinical tests and novel therapies for this significant medical problem. To date, there is no biologic tool
to determine the necessary morphine dose in withdrawing infants, or to predict which infants will experience
neurodevelopmental delays. This is partly due to the fact that prior studies have largely focused on the
molecular response to opioid administration in adults, rather than the response to opioid withdrawal in infants.
Serum levels of certain micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are impacted by opioid administration in adults (e.g.,
let-7a, miR-146a, miR-192). These short, non-coding nucleic acids also regulate neurogenesis, neuronal
progenitor cell (NPC) maturation, and cell survival by repressing target messenger RNAs in the Argonaute
complex. My sponsor, Dr. Steve Hicks, MD, PhD has pioneered the use of salivary miRNAs as non-invasive
markers for pediatric neurodevelopmental conditions. Most salivary miRNAs are derived from exosomes, which
can arise from the cranial nerves that densely innervate the oropharynx. My preliminary data shows that
several “opioid-responsive” miRNAs are perturbed in the saliva of infants with NAS relative to healthy infants.
Further, I have developed an in vitro system of opioid withdrawal utilizing human NPCs that displays dose-
related perturbations in miR-146a along with disruptions in NPC fate. Based on these findings, the central
hypothesis of my fellowship application is that morphine withdrawal alters miRNA expression in the developing
brain, which impairs neuronal maturation by mRNA translation via Argonaute binding. I also hypothesize that
salivary levels of exosomal miRNAs from infants with NAS will be directly related to both the maximal dose of
morphine required for symptom control, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at six months. I will test these
hypotheses in two specific aims. First, I will perform a longitudinal cohort study of 50 infants with NAS to
determine whether salivary miRNA levels within brain-related exosomes can be measured at admission to
predict the maximum morphine dose required for symptom control, and again at discharge to predict
neurodevelopmental outcomes at six months (Aim 1). Second, I will transfect miRNA mimics in my in vitro NPC
design of opioid withdrawal, and assess the mechanism by which miRNAs impact the response to opioid
withdrawal with immunocytochemistry, single-cell RNA sequencing, and an Argonaute pull-down assay (Aim
2)."
10897774,"Proteomics is an invaluable tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underpin the onset of
disease. The modern vision of the proteome encompasses the broad complexity of “protein forms”, or
proteoforms, created by specific sets of genetic and chemical modifications that can alter and regulate
protein bioactivity. In biomedical research it is pivotal to analyze proteoforms at three distinct levels: first,
determination of primary structure, including identity and position of modifications; second, the quantity
or abundance of these modifications; and finally, characterization of proteoform assemblies. These
protein complexes are held together by weak interactions and are the actual bioactive molecular
machines that function in vivo. Currently, proteoforms can only be characterized at the global scale using
mass spectrometry (MS). Known as top-down proteomics (TDP), this nascent field has not yet developed
into a scalable solution on the level of next generation sequencing or even peptide-based shotgun
proteomics, due to the advanced technology required to precisely measure large proteoforms. For this
reason, TDP studies are typically limited to proteoforms <30 kDa, which represent less than half of the
mammalian proteome. Furthermore, these studies are most often conducted under reducing, denaturing
conditions to facilitate preanalytical workflows, so that higher order structure of proteoforms is lost
together with cysteine-linked post-translational modifications (PTMs). Fortunately, contemporary
structural biologists can analyze multi-proteoform complexes (MPCs) by MS under “native-like”
conditions that preserve non-covalent interactions, although this technology is incompatible with high-
throughput studies that can be leveraged to discover novel biological insights. Here, we propose a new
TDP pipeline that extends the mass range of proteoforms measurable in discovery mode, and also
integrates denaturing and native MS to measure MPCs. We will first combine innovative separation
techniques and gas-phase chemistries (e.g., novel ion fragmentation techniques and ion-ion reactions)
to improve the detection and sequencing of proteoforms up to 100 kDa, and allow the characterization of
neglected PTMs. Then, these technologies will be applied to the quantification of proteoforms >30 kDa
both in large-scale discovery studies (to identify proteoform expression variations between healthy and
disease states) and in targeted experiments (to monitor subsets of proteoforms of interest). Finally, the
qualitative and quantitative information collected on single proteoforms through denaturing TDP
experiments will be used to facilitate the automatized characterization of MPCs in high-throughput native
MS studies. This multi-level, proteoform-centric approach to the global analysis of proteomes will provide
researchers with otherwise inaccessible information, opening new possibilities to formulate novel
hypotheses for medical treatment and for the discovery of diagnostic disease biomarkers."
10897784,"Causal questions are at the heart of science. Yet, cognitive biases and logical fallacies are major sources
of error in causal research across all disciplines. For decades, most aspiring young scientists, those in
post-graduate training as well as experienced practitioners in continuing education have not been formally
trained – as opposed to a mentor-focused approach - in the philosophical foundations of research practice,
including causal reasoning. Instead, science education is strongly influenced by the prevailing culture of
valuing specialized subject matter knowledge over sound education in the first principles of science.
The proposed NeuR3o-LOGIC learning unit will emphasize critical thinking on causal questions, illustrated
by examples from the neurosciences at the interface of the gut-brain axis, an ostensive topic that every
human being can relate to. Inspired by our experiences of ‘teaching science like we do science’ in the R3
Graduate Science Program and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, we approach this
complex topic from the angle of sound error analysis. Driven by our commitment to the three ‘R’s of good
scientific practice – Rigor, Reproducibility, and Responsibility, which inform the R3 Program’s name – the
proposed METER project will put the learner into a position to recognize where science can go wrong in
the realm of causation. Supported by tangible research examples at the intersection of the gut microbiome
and the nervous system, the NeuR3o-LOGIC unit will provide the learner with opportunities to employ a
structured error analysis and reduction approach to make connections between fundamental thinking in
logic and epistemology and major public health issues such as autism spectrum disorders and other
neurological conditions.
The proposed work does complement, yet not overlap with existing and ongoing, federally funded projects
of educational scholarship on the effectiveness of R3 Program training in ethical decision making and data
science skills (NSF-IGE Award #1955062; R25 Award #R25AI159447; administrative supplement on T32

While the first project year will be focused on the design, production, progress monitoring, and initial quality
improvement within the NeuR3o-LOGIC project team, regular communication with CENTER will ensure the
alignment of goals and objectives. Years two and three of the proposed project will be dedicated towards
structured and coordinated project evaluation and revision activities in close coordination with CENTER,
the steering committee, and the network of METER awardees in a collaborative community of practice."
10867846,"Risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) risk increases with aging. Later-life depression affects 12-40% of
people over 65yrs old, with biological risk factors including female sex, systemic inflammation and cognitive
deficits. Women exhibit 5-10 fold higher risk for later-life depression vs. men. Environmental factors can contrib-
ute notably to mental health status in aging. Rates of MDD rise significantly with living at altitude. Chronic hypo-
baric hypoxia (CH-hypoxia) exposure occurs at altitude. We established a novel sex-based translational model
to study impact of CH-hypoxia on vulnerability to depression. After 2-3wks in CH-hypoxia (4,500ft,or 18% partial
pressure of oxygen or ppO2) vs normal oxygen levels (sea level or 21%ppO2), young adult rats (2.5m old) exhibit
symptoms of depression, anxiety, anhedonia and cognitive dysfunction. Females are particularly susceptible.
Rats in CH-hypoxia exhibit poor brain bioenergetics and systemic inflammation (elevated serum interleukin 6 or
IL6, an inflammatory cytokine). Rats in CH-hypoxia do not respond to most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), but show antidepressant-like response to bioenergetic compounds such as cyclocreatine. Systemic
inflammation and brain hypometabolism are hallmarks of aging, implying that CH-hypoxia may act as a signifi-
cant risk factor for later-life MDD, especially in women. Systemic inflammation is linked to SSRI inefficacy and
treatment-resistant depression. In older MDD patients, elevated serum IL6 is linked to impaired cognitive func-
tion. The means by which inflammatory mediators may promote a depressive phenotype is as yet unclear, but
may involve impact on neurotrophic factors and hippocampal neurogenesis. We now propose studies utilizing
this model to evaluate age and sex as biological variables for impact of CH-hypoxia on vulnerability to depres-
sion. Impact on behavioral and molecular biomarkers of depression will be addressed, including impact on in-
flammatory and bioenergetic pathways, cognitive deficits linked to MDD, and efficacy of therapeutics. Our cen-
tral hypothesis is that aging will intensify the impact of CH-hypoxia on inflammatory and brain bioenergetic
processes, to worsen depressive and cognitive symptoms, and reduce treatment efficacy, with females more
susceptible. Rats at the age of young adults (2.5m), older adults (4m, 8m) or aging adults (18m) will be tested
after housing in CH-hypoxia (4,500ft) vs. normal oxygen levels (sea level). In Aim 1, rats will be tested for de-
pression-like and anxiety-like behaviors. In Aim 2, rats will be tested for cognitive function, including learning and
memory, and cognitive bias. Rats will be sacrificed and brain/serum tested for bioenergetic compounds (creatine,
ATP), inflammatory mediators (IL6, IL-1β, TNFα, CRP), BDNF and hippocampal neurogenesis. In Aim 3, young
adults (2.5m) and aging adults (18m) in CH-hypoxia or sea level, will be tested for antidepressant-like effects of
the SSRI fluoxetine and the bioenergetic compound cyclocreatine. These studies will lay the foundation for future
research on the role of age and sex in CH-hypoxia-induced vulnerability to depression, and will allow us to
explore novel therapeutics for later-life MDD based on the role of inflammatory and bioenergetic pathways."

Most of what we know about visual search comes from experiments where observers perform hundreds of
searches for the same things (e.g. several hundred searches for a vowel among other letters). However,
most searches in the world are not performed in blocks. People look for one thing and then another.
Emergency Department (ED) radiology where a radiologist might look for pneumonia in a chest X-ray,
followed by a search for a possible stroke in a head CT, and so on, represents a socially important real-world
example that we will study here. Decades of research have established rules of search, based on roughly
uniform blocks of searches. Do those rules continue to apply if searches are mixed? The importance of this
question can be seen if we consider the problem of when to end a search. Quit too soon and targets (like
that stroke) can be missed. Quit too late and time is wasted, perhaps dangerously (e.g. if a driver
perseverates on a search on the dashboard control panel). Models of search termination often propose an
adaptive process where responses on previous trials serve to adjust the quitting threshold on subsequent
trials. How can such an adaptive process work if the preceding trials come from many different tasks? We
hypothesize that multiple adaptive rules coexist, but that they may be less optimal in the mixed environment.
The answer to such questions will shape how we attempt to minimize error in settings like ED radiology.
There are four series of proposed experiments. In Exp 1, trials of several different tasks are run, either in
single-task blocks or mixed together. In Exp 2, the target remains the same on all trials but the distractors
(and, thus, the search task) change. This is intended to emulate situations like screening mammography
where the same target (e.g. a mass) is presented on visually different backgrounds (fatty vs dense breast
parenchyma). In Exp 3, multiple tasks are available simultaneously (as in driving or managing the control
panel of a complex machine). Here, the observer can choose, to some extent, whether to perform blocked or
mixed searches. Finally, in Exp 4, we compare mixed and blocked searches using radiologists as observers
in a version of the ED radiology task. Significantly, this will be the first medical image perception study of the
ED task. While we expect that many of the basic principles of search will be similar in mixed and blocked
conditions, we hypothesize that some rules, notably those pertaining to errors in search, will differ in mixed
and blocked situations. Understanding the rules of search when the specific search task changes from
moment to moment will be critical to reducing the errors that plague real world searches from the
inconsequential failure to find a pen to those with potential life and death consequences."

Neuromodulators including dopamine and serotonin have profound effects on spinal circuits for locomotion. A wealth
of pharmacological manipulations has shown that drugs mimicking or blocking these neuromodulators can change the
properties of rhythmic motor output in the isolated spinal cord. However, these studies often conflict and cannot
capture the normal range of behaviors expressed in vivo. Furthermore, it is entirely unknown whether neuromodulators
are released onto different spinal targets across different behaviors. Finally, neuromodulatory neurons are highly
branched, making it difficult to disambiguate the spinal vs supraspinal consequences of their action. We will leverage
new tools for imaging and manipulating neuromodulator signaling, combined with the transparency and accessibility of
the young zebrafish, and a quantitative modeling approach, to understand the effects of dopamine and serotonin on
genetically defined components of the spinal locomotor circuit in vivo. First, we will measure the activity of
neuromodulatory axons during three distinct behaviors, testing whether dopamine and serotonin axons differentially
participate in these behaviors. Next, we will quantify neuromodulator release during these behaviors directly, both in
the whole spinal cord and in genetically defined populations of neurons with distinct contributions to locomotion. We
will then test the significance of descending neuromodulatory influence on spinal circuits by targeted axotomy that will
allow disambiguation of the spinal and supraspinal consequences of neuromodulator release. Finally, using newly
developed chemogenetic approaches, we will selectively block neuromodulatory receptors in motor neurons and
measure the consequences on the three distinct behaviors in freely moving animals. Throughout the project, we will
use experimental data to develop both single-segment and multi-segment computational models of neuromodulatory
action, and in turn use these models to make testable predictions about circuits and behavior. Together, these
experiments will reveal for the first time when and where dopamine and serotonin are acting in the spinal locomotor
circuit, and how their actions influence behavior in vivo."

This proposal is to produce IND-enabling data for supporting clinical trials of an attenuated clone
of the mouse-adapted Chlamydia muridarum (CM) as a novel oral vaccine known as intrOv for
protecting humans from sexually transmitted infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT).
Extensive searching for a subunit vaccine against CT has not produced a licensed vaccine. One
of the challenges is that all 8 STI-causing CT serovars (D to K) are significant human pathogens
globally. We are proposing to develop intrOv into an oral vaccine against 8 CT serovars. Following
a single oral inoculation, CM can establish long-lasting colonization in the mouse gastrointestinal
(GI) tract but without causing any significant pathologies; Oral CM induces Th1-dominant
transmucosal immunity against subsequent infection in the genital tract and airway but without
altering CM colonization in the GI tract; CM colonization in the GI tract for 1 week is sufficient for
inducing protective immunity in the genital tract and antibiotics clearance of GI tract CM does not
compromise the genital protective immunity; To improve the safety of CM as an oral vaccine,
genital tract pathogenicity-attenuated CM clones have been generated by various labs but the
clone designated as intracellular Oral vaccine vector or intrOv is particularly attractive since it is
still able to induce transmucosal protection in the genital tract but no longer maintains long-lasting
colonization in the colon; IntrOv induces IFN+ILC3s and is also inhibited by IFN+ILC3s; Finally
intrOv-induced transmucosal immunity conferred cross-species protection against CT in the
genital tract, validating previously observed CM induction of anti-CT immunity. Thus, we
hypothesize that oral intrOv protects human genital tract from CT infection and the intrOv-induced
IFN+ILC3s in the gut may present cross-species epitopes to lymphocytes for mediating Th1-
dorminant transmucosal immunity. We will test these hypotheses by validating the protection
efficacy of intrOv against genital CT in mice and large animals, identifying protective correlates
and CT antigens for improving clinical assays & intrOv efficacy and improving the quality and
safety of intrOv as a human oral vaccine. Our hypotheses are consistent with these successful
examples of using animal-adapted microbes to protect against human pathogens: cowpox as a
vaccine against smallpox, BCG (M. bovis) against M. tuberculosis and meningococcal vaccine
against gonorrhoea."
10896997,"When learning a new task, both rats and humans exhibit suboptimal behaviors plagued with superstitious
ticks and idiosyncratic biases. One prominent example of such suboptimality are sequential effects:
animals tend to bias their choices based on previous decisions and outcomes, hindering performance in
common laboratory tasks using independent trials.
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have become a common tool to study potential neural mechanisms of
cognition. Yet, RNNs typically behave much closer to optimality in laboratory tasks than real subjects. We
suggest this behavioral difference is rooted in the fundamental discrepancy between how animals and
current RNNs learn: unlike animals before learning, RNNs before training are tabula rasa and their
connectivity is adjusted exclusively to the local contingencies of the task.
We hypothesize that animals’ learning of simple laboratory tasks builds mostly on pre-existing programs,
namely structural prior, that have been shaped by evolution for the species’ fitness in a given ecological
niche. Sequential effects are a manifestation of such pre-wired strategies, which may ultimately support
learning. To test this, we will characterize sequential effects during learning of a set of perceptual tasks
and identify their underlying neural circuitry. We will compare animals’ behavior with RNNs which, after
being equipped with structural priors, can mimic the animal’s ability to learn new tasks.
Objectives
Objective 1. Compare sequential effects in humans and rats with those developed by RNNs.
Objective 2. Characterize the role of the corticostriatal circuit mPFC --> DMS in the tasks and the site of
plasticity necessary for task learning.
Objective 3. Characterize the neural mechanisms underlying the representation of relevant variables in
the brain of the rat and in RNNs."
10896999,"With the rapid advance of high-resolution transcriptomic profiling techniques, recent years have witnessed
an increased interest in the study of the tissue microenvironment (TM) arising in cancer research and
neuroscience, i.e., the collection of cells and structures in a tissue, such as neuron and glia in neural tissue
or immune, stroma, and epithelial cells in tumors. The spatial configuration of these cells and structures
plays pivotal roles in tissue function. Researchers have obtained high resolution transcriptomic and imaging
data for TM study. The two types of information complement each other. High resolution transcriptomic
profiling, such as single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA), provides cellular level molecular information, but does not
carry local contextual information of cell, while histology image analysis provides detailed context, but does
not provide corresponding cellular gene expression profiles. To combine them is challenging due to a lack
of one-to-one correspondence between cells in transcriptomics and cells in histology images.
This project intends to unify transcriptomics and bioimage informatics for a comprehensive study of
TM, applying the advanced topological data analysis (TDA) methodology on the newly emerged spatial
transcriptomic (ST) data. ST data provides localized spatial transcriptomics. TDA provides the foundation
for studying rich contextual information in multi-omics. This project will produce a spatial-context-aware
high-resolution mapping of TM transcriptomics. The outcome will be highly impactful. It will not only
promote normal tissue level functionality characterization and mechanism study, but will also boost various
types of diseases’ diagnosis, prognosis as well as their mechanistic studies.
The PI/Co-PIs will create new topological approaches to extract rich contextual information from cells
of multiple types in histology images. They will also propose new learning algorithms to integrate such
topological information into localized ST scRNA data analysis for better differentiation of cells of different
types and states, to build connection between spatial context and cell signaling gene activation, and to map
transcriptomics information into whole slide image for visualization."

Patient-derived tumor organoids (PDO), involving the ex vivo culture of fresh tumor fragments,
have emerged as promising models for predicting patient drug response for personalized cancer
therapy. PDOs recapitulate the tumor micro-environment (TME), resemble the source tumor
phenotypically and genomically, and are compatible with high-throughput drug screening.
However, the lack of preservation of immune cells in PDOs has been a major roadblock to
modeling immunotherapy. Our team recently demonstrated a new type of PDO that cultures tumor
fragments as a cohesive unit, allowing the in situ preservation of diverse immune cell types
alongside tumor cells without artificial reconstitution. This approach has enabled the modeling of
patient-specific responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
 One of the first steps in the generation of PDOs is the dissection of patient tumor specimen
into small fragments. Mechanical dissection, instead of enzymatic digestion, is critical in
preserving the in vivo association between tumor cells and endogenous immune and non-immune
elements. The ability to preserve endogenous immune cells, including tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes (TIL), is particularly important for personalized immunotherapy testing.
 However, current mechanical dissection relies primarily on manual mincing of tumor specimen
into small fragments. It results in fragments with a broad size range, and is imprecise and
irreproducible. Fragments that are too large suffer from inadequate nutrient supply, suboptimal
oxygenation and viability, and poor drug penetration. Fragments that are too small are unlikely to
preserve sufficient stromal cells to support PDO growth, and/or endogenous immune cells which
may be present at low concentrations.
 As such, there is an unmet need for a better way to generate tumor fragments of controllable
and uniform size, and identify optimal size(s) to increase the reproducibility and yield of viable
PDOs that can preserve the cellular contexture and tumor architecture. This project aims to
address this need by developing a new method to mechanically dissect tumor specimen into
uniform fragments. Performance measures include fragment size uniformity, PDO viability,
preservation of immune cells, and tumor cytotoxicity in response to immunotherapy. Other cutting
methods including manual mincing will be used as benchmarks."

thromobocytopenia, and accumulation of hemophagocytes— activated macrophages that phagocytose red
blood cells (RBCs). I will investigate spontaneous MAS-like disease in a mouse model of Systemic Lupus
Erythematosus. In the TLR7.1 model, the overexpression of and constitutively active signaling through the
endosomal single-stranded RNA sensor Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) drives chronic inflammation and subsequent
MAS disease. TLR7.1 mice develop thrombocytopenia, anemia, and a novel population of hemophagocytes,
inflammatory hemophagocytes (iHPCs), that spontaneously differentiate from Ly6Chi monocytes. Further, in this
model, the development of anemia is positively correlated with iHPC phagocytosis of RBCs indicating that iHPC
activity may be driving disease.
 In humans, SNPs in the gene encoding the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) are
associated with MAS development. IRF5 signaling is critical for the development of inflammatory macrophages
in the context several inflammatory diseases. Previous work in our lab showed that IRF5 ablation in vivo
ameliorates iHPC differentiation downstream of acute TLR7 signaling. However, in the context of in vivo TLR7-
driven MAS, the role of IRF5 signaling in iHPC production and in MAS disease is unclear. In preliminary data, I
show in TLR7.1 mice that signaling through IRF5 is critical for iHPC development, iHPC RBC phagocytosis, and
anemia and thrombocytopenia indicative of MAS disease development. Based on these findings, the goal of my
proposal is to determine the role of IRF5 signaling, specifically in Ly6Chi monocytes, in TLR7- driven iHPC
differentiation and MAS disease (AIM 1), and to determine what other signals synergize with TLR7 to drive iHPC
differentiation and MAS disease, with a specific focus on heme and type I interferons (AIM 2). Overall, completion
of the proposed research along with my additional training described here will allow me to pursue my goals of
becoming an independent investigator and faculty member with a focus on education."

The cognitive functions of the brain allow higher animals to interact with the world in complex and adaptive
manners. For example, animals use past experiences to develop internal models of rules and contexts that
shape subsequent decisions. These cognitive processes are disrupted in many devastating mental health
disorders. Traditional experiments in cognitive neuroscience have identified correlations between cognitive
processes and behavioral outputs or neural events. However, it has been challenging to uncover the causal
mechanisms by which cognitive processes emerge from the basic building blocks of neurobiological
computations: molecules, cells, synapses, and circuits. The reason is, in large part, because it has been difficult
to combine emerging mechanistic approaches in neuroscience with paradigms to study cognitive processes.
Here we aim to overcome these challenges by developing a research program to identify causal links between
cognitive processes and the structure – cell types and connectivity – and function – spatiotemporal activity
patterns in neural populations – of neural circuits. We recently devised a virtual reality system for mice and
developed methods to train mice to perform complex, cognitive tasks as they navigate through virtual
environments. Further, we developed neurophysiological and computational tools that have identified correlates
of cognitive processes in the activity patterns in population of neurons. We will use this foundation to establish a
research program for mechanistic cognitive neuroscience. First, we will develop an atlas of cell types in cognitive
brain regions, use viral tools to label these cell types, and then study the functional roles of these cell types
during flexible decision-making tasks. Second, we will establish methods based on single-neuron optogenetics
to reveal connectivity between identified cells during cognitive behaviors. Third, we will use calcium imaging to
‘read’ patterns of neural activity during cognitive tasks and will then ‘write’ and ‘erase’ these patterns using
patterned optogenetics to test sufficiency and necessity. We will study these structural and functional properties
in local populations of neurons (microcircuits) and across brain areas (mesocircuits). This work will expand the
emerging field of mechanistic cognitive neuroscience and develop a new research program toward the goal of
defining cognition and mental health in terms of core biological components and mechanisms."

10897328,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND. The goal of this proposal is to improve outcomes for hospitalized patients with Alcohol
Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS). AWS is common in hospitals and can be fatal without appropriate management;
however, treatments for AWS also have dangerous side effects. Suboptimal treatment (persistent agitation or
oversedation) leads to adverse events (e.g., use of physical restraints or mechanical ventilation), which are
potentially avoidable but have never been studied. Moreover, the two types of medications used as first-line
therapy for inpatient AWS—benzodiazepines and phenobarbital—have never been rigorously compared in
hospitalized patients. Both treatments are recommended by guidelines at the discretion of clinicians, yet their
comparative safety remains unknown. CANDIDATE. Dr. Tessa Steel is a critical care physician who co-led a
national panel of experts to develop a comprehensive research agenda for improving the care of severe AWS.
The proposed K23 builds on this foundation and her prior studies, showing wide variation in current treatments
for inpatient AWS. RESEARCH. First, Dr. Steel will investigate how and why inpatient physicians choose to
treat inpatient AWS with benzodiazepines versus phenobarbital, using interviews and an implementation
science framework for understanding provider behavior. Second, she will evaluate the risk of adverse events
(e.g., use of physical restraints) associated with benzodiazepines versus phenobarbital in diverse groups of
hospitalized patients, using real-world data from electronic health records (EHRs). These studies will inform
her third aim—to design and pilot a pragmatic randomized trial, embedded in hospital care, comparing
benzodiazepines to phenobarbital for hospitalized patients with AWS. The pilot will serve as groundwork for a
definitive multi-center randomized trial (Dr. Steel’s planned R01) to determine the safest first-line therapy for
inpatient AWS. CAREER DEVELOPMENT. Dr. Steel’s goal is to be an innovative clinical researcher who
improves outcomes for hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder. To launch her career as an
independent physician scientist, the proposed K23 award provides essential training in (1) qualitative research
methods, (2) advanced analytic strategies for using EHR data, and (3) the design and conduct of embedded
pragmatic clinical trials. Dr. Steel will conduct her research at the University of Washington (UW) under the
primary mentorship of Dr. Katharine Bradley, who is an expert in mixed methods research using EHR data,
including pragmatic trials. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Nicholas Johnson, providing expertise related to
clinical trials conducted in hospital settings and Dr. Kevin Hallgren, a methodologic expert on the use of EHR
data for clinical AUD research. PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT. The proposed career development award will
support an early-career investigator conducting research to improve management of AWS for the ~2 million
patients hospitalized with this problem per year in the United States."
10895085,"The proposed studies will uncover components of a core neural system that underlies affiliative, rewarding,
non-sexual social communication. In cases of depression, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders, social
interactions that are typically rewarding can become aversive. Deficits can also be context-specific. For
example, some autistic individuals are able to make directed requests (e.g., for food) that can be extrinsically
reinforced (e.g., by receipt of food) but exhibit profound deficits in affiliative communication (e.g., nonsexual,
chitchat) that promotes social bonds and is rewarding but does not result in an immediate, obvious extrinsic
reinforcer. Many studies focus on mechanisms underlying goal-directed, extrinsically rewarded behaviors (e.g.,
food-, mate-, or drug-directed); however, these mechanisms appear to differ from those underlying intrinsically
rewarded, affiliative social behaviors, leaving a critical gap in basic knowledge about mechanisms underlying
non-sexual, affiliative communication. Studies taking advantage of the unique communication properties of
songbirds reveal a previously unappreciated role for the medial preoptic nucleus (mPOA) and in particular mu
opioid receptors (MORs) in the mPOA in both facilitating and rewarding a form of non-sexual, affiliative singing
behavior. Preliminary RNAseq data reveal for the first time a complex of glutamatergic genes in mPOA to be
tightly associated with this type of song. The objective of this application is to integrate findings related to the
essential role of glutamate and glutamate-MOR interactions in reward to identify foundational, understudied
biological mechanisms that underlie affiliative, rewarding communication. The central hypothesis is that
glutamate-related genes and MOR-glutamate interactions in the mPOA play critical roles in affiliative
communication and other social interactions. The rationale is the need for basic, mechanistic information on
core social circuits that underlie behaviors disrupted by mental illness. Based on past and preliminary data, two
specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine selective contributions of glutamate-related genes in mPOA to
affiliative song, social motivation, and reward; 2) Explore the role of MOR-glutamate interactions in mPOA in
affiliative song and reward. In Aim 1 shRNA will be used to knockdown glutamate-related genes SHANK2,
GRM5 or GRIN1 in mPOA or a control region, and affiliative song, other social behaviors, social motivation,
and social reward will be tested. In Aim 2 effects of the same manipulations on the ability of pharmacological
MOR stimulation to facilitate affiliative song as well as reward will be tested. The approach is innovative
because it advances the understanding of intrinsically-rewarded social behavior in songbirds with the goal of
identifying fundamental, conserved mechanisms. The proposal is significant because it will elucidate the role of
glutamate-related genes and MOR-glutamate interactions in non-sexual, affiliative social behaviors and provide
insight into core neural circuits that may be disrupted by mental illness in humans."

This T32 post-doctoral training program, now in its 31st year, provides 2-3 years of fellowship designed to prepare
PhDs and physicians for investigative careers in obesity research. Of the fellows trained with support from this
T32 during the past 15 years, 92% remain in research (academic, industry) positions related to obesity and allied
disorders. Our Specific Aim is to train promising young scientists to become independent investigators focusing
on obesity-related issues. Our long-term objective is to increase the investigator pool working on the broad
biology of obesity and its co-morbidities. This program has important national implications since obesity is among
the foremost health problems facing America, imposing growing costs in terms of human suffering, health care
and productivity. There is a critical dearth of well-trained young investigators. We provide a structured curriculum
in the first 2 years (includes career development and grantsmanship), in combination with a research experience
emphasizing wide opportunities in basic laboratory and/or translational research, reflecting the great strengths
of Columbia University in these areas. Post-doctoral fellows are appointed at Columbia University, enabling
access to a wide array of formal courses throughout the University. The T32 has specified course requirements
that are attuned to the fellow’s previous experience and selected research project. Fellows participate in
seminars of obesity, diabetes, nutrition and other bioscience Centers of the University. Trainees elect to work
with a faculty member at Columbia and are incorporated into the investigative program of mentors at the New
York Nutrition Obesity Research Center and other laboratories. The faculty's multidisciplinary nature (physicians,
biochemists, cell biologists, pathologists, neuroscientists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, molecular biologists and
geneticists) allows a multi-disciplinary approach by the trainees. Strong collaborative ties among the training
faculty make this possible. Trainees have access to the entire spectrum of research tools in obesity biology,
ranging from structural/cell biology, molecular genetics and neuroscience through clinical investigation. Trainees
are (1) physicians who have completed 3 to 5 years of post-graduate clinical training, (2) recent PhD (or
equivalent) recipients in disciplines including (but not limited) to molecular genetics, biochemistry, nutrition,
physiology, neuroendocrinology, neuroscience, or pharmacology. Individuals are selected based on their
demonstrated competence in medical and/or graduate school, recommendations of their faculties, and
consideration of the extent to which their research interests are congruent with those of the Columbia faculty. All
trainees at time of entry must be pursuing an investigative career in obesity (including its complications) or
appetitive behaviors. An Individual Development Plan is created for each trainee and is monitored by an ad hoc
Scholarly Oversight Committee. Minority diversity is an explicit goal of the program. Each of the participating
faculty laboratories (n= 25: 7 Junior/18 Senior) is well equipped and funded to support a trainee's research.
Continued funding for 3 trainee slots per year for a 5-year award is requested."
10896932,"ABSTRACT
Resistance to apoptosis is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Cancer cells circumvent cell death through the
mitochondrial apoptosis pathway to ensure tumor growth, maintenance and resistance to current treatments.
The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway is governed by the expression levels and interactions of the BCL-2 family
proteins, which comprise the pro-apoptotic effector proteins BAX and BAK, the anti-apoptotic proteins e.g. BCL-
2, BCL-XL, MCL-1 and the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins. Cancer cells most commonly block mitochondrial
apoptosis by upregulating the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins that neutralize BH3-only proteins and activated BAX
and BAK. Therefore, efforts have focused on the development of selective inhibitors of anti-apoptotic BCL-2
proteins to re-activate apoptosis. Inhibitors such as the FDA-approved Venetoclax rely on the function and
availability of BH3-only proteins to activate BAX and BAK. However, in many tumors, BH3-only proteins can be
downregulated, suppressed or deleted, making these tumors insensitive to these inhibitors and limiting their
broader clinical application. We hypothesized that small-molecule direct activation of pro-apoptotic BAX via the
BAX trigger site is an alternative and possibly complementary pharmacological strategy to promote apoptosis in
cancer cells. This approach can promote BAX activation independently of BH3-only proteins and therefore
should have the potential to overcome apoptosis blockade in resistant tumors. Our laboratory recently used
unique structural and molecular insights and medicinal chemistry to develop a potent and selective compound,
termed BAX Trigger Site Activator 1(BTSA1) that promotes BAX activation and induces mitochondrial
dysfunction and apoptosis. Using BTSA1, we provided proof-of-concept for direct BAX activation as a therapeutic
target in Acute Myeloid Leukemia and demonstrated that direct BAX activation is well tolerated in vivo. Here, we
hypothesized to generate BTSA1 analogues with improved potency, oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics.
Our goal is to evaluate their activity and mechanism of action in diverse cancer models as single agents or
combination treatments and investigate mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to BAX activation and
apoptosis. Moreover, we aim to identify a clinical candidate BAX activator with favorable cellular,
pharmacological and safety properties. Therefore, we propose the following specific aims: 1) characterize
potency, selectivity, pro-apoptotic activity, in vitro ADME/Tox and pharmacokinetic properties of BTSA1
analogues, 2) determine cellular efficacy and mechanism of action of 2nd generation BTSAs, including BTSA1.2,
alone and in combination treatments using various leukemia and solid tumor cells and investigate determinants
of sensitivity and resistance, 3) determine safety and therapeutic potential of select BTSAs alone or in
combination therapy and investigate novel biomarkers and mechanisms of apoptosis regulation. This proposal
will advance an innovative therapeutic strategy and therapeutics and inform the most suitable context for
targeting BAX activation in cancer."
10897182,"The abuse of alcohol is controlled by multiple effects of the drug, including its subjective, reinforcing, and re-
lapse-inducing effects. Preclinical methods have been developed to assess the contribution of these control-
ling factors and their neurobiological underpinnings, and to provide empirically based models for evaluating
potential treatment strategies. Alcohol's ability to potentiate the activity of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at
GABAA receptors has been implicated as a key mechanism underlying the abuse-related effects of alcohol in
both humans and laboratory animals, making this system an attractive candidate for the development of thera-
peutics. The complex molecular biology of GABAA receptors raises the possibility that subtype-selective
agents might be developed with therapeutic specificity against alcohol. In this application, we will investigate
the role of γ- and δ-containing α4GABAA and α6GABAA receptor mechanisms in nonhuman primate and rodent
models of the abuse-related effects of alcohol. We will use first-in-kind compounds that are selective for α4δ,
α6δ, α4γ, and/or α6γGABAA receptors to investigate the contribution of these subtypes to: 1) the discriminative
stimulus effects of alcohol in monkeys trained to discriminate intra-gastrically-administered alcohol from vehi-
cle, 2) the reinforcing effects of alcohol in monkeys orally self-administering alcohol, and 3) the relapse-
inducing effects of alcohol in rats trained in either cue-induced reinstatement or alcohol deprivation effect pro-
cedures (Specific Aim 1). Understanding the neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying the addictive ef-
fects of alcohol is an important initial step in the development of candidate pharmacotherapies for the treat-
ment of alcohol abuse and dependence. The degree to which the effects of γ- and δ-selective α4GABAA and
α6GABAA ligands selectively modify alcohol-controlled behavior will be evaluated in monkeys that self-
administer a sucrose solution instead of alcohol and in rats trained in a cue-induced sucrose seeking proce-
dure. In monkeys, concurrent observational studies will characterize the effects of the ligands, alone or com-
bined with alcohol, on unconditioned motor behavior (Specific Aim 2). The ability of these ligands to mimic or
modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of alcohol, alcohol self-administration, and cue-induced alcohol
seeking and relapse-like drinking at doses that do not produce a generalized disruption of behavior or debilitat-
ing side effects may be predictive of potential therapeutic utility. Finally, we will investigate the utility of selec-
tive GABAergic ligands with favorable side effect profiles to serve as co-therapies in a model of medication-
assisted treatment (Specific Aim 3). These studies will make use of a novel resurgence model of contingency
management developed recently in our laboratory and, initially, ligands that either mimic or attenuate the be-
havioral effects of alcohol. Integration of results from the aims will continue to yield needed information about
neuropharmacological mechanisms underlying the addictive effects of alcohol and begin to identify clinical
scenarios in which pharmacological approaches might be expected to produce improved patient outcomes."

Islet transplantation offers a potential cure for Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Wide adoption of a cell therapy
requires abundant islet supplies and effective immune protection without long-term systemic immune
suppression. My laboratory and others showed that it was feasible to derive insulin-secreting cells
from renewable and abundant gastrointestinal (GI) stem cells. However, it has not been possible to
mass-produce islet-like organoids from human GI tissues for detailed assessment of their
translational potential.
In preliminary studies, we established methods to culture human gastric stem cells (hGSCs) from
biopsy samples and expanded them to billions. The hGSCs were engineered for transient activation
of NGN3 and stable expression of PDX1 and MAFA (collectively referred to as NPM factors), leading
to formation of thousands of GINS (Gastric Insulin Secreting) organoids. GINS organoids acquired
glucose-stimulated-insulin-secretion (GSIS) within 10 days, and upon transplantation, rapidly
reversed diabetes in mice and maintained normoglycemia for over 3 months, with no tumor
formation. Human GINS organoids thus have favorable attributes as a potential cell product for T1D
treatment with a scalable derivation method.
GINS organoids contain 25-30% of cells that closely resemble pancreatic Beta-cells. In this project, we
will evaluate the hypothesis that clonal hGSC lines yielding a higher percentage of Beta-like cells can
be readily identified from donor tissues. We will develop a standard derivation protocol using genetic
knockin of NPM and clonal selection with the aim to consistently produce highly functional GINS
grafts from donors. GINS cells lack key autoantigens and may be naturally less immunogenic than
islet Beta-cells. We will confer further autoimmune protection by constitutive expression of two potent
immune regulators PD-L1 an CD47. Normal and immune-evasive organoids will be evaluated in vitro
and in vivo with a panel of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells, the main effector of Beta-cell demise
in T1D. Together, these studies will create a technology for reliable production of autologous GINS
grafts with strong autoimmune protection, suitable for long-term glycemic control without immune
isolation or suppression."
10897185,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and primarily sporadic neurodegenerative disease involving the
death of upper and lower motor neurons. There are a myriad of pathological mechanisms underlying this disease,
which makes identifying a single target for treatment a great challenge. It is largely accepted that ALS is caused
by a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors. The importance of environmental factors is
supported by inter alia discordance in monozygotic twins, conjugal ALS and increased risk of ALS with specific
occupations and toxic exposures. While there remains an urgent need to define the pathological etiology of ALS,
exposure assessments within etiologically-relevant, pre-symptom time intervals has proven difficult due to
differences in methodology and poor assessment methods. In regards physiological assessments, certain
chemical elements have been linked to neurotoxicity (e.g. lead). To date, lead represents one of the strongest
environmental risk factors connected to ALS. The identification of additional ALS-associated elements however
has been stymied by (1) discrepancies in reported measurements and (2) the fact that peripheral measurements
rarely reflect the physiological load within the central nervous system. In light of these challenges, our preliminary
work indicates an association between toxic element exposures and ALS in epochs prior to diagnosis for lead,
mercury and manganese. We have further detected the presence of these same elements in ALS patient brain
tissue. We now propose to validate these and other elements as environmental risk factors in Massachusetts
(MA), the only state in the country with a reportable (mandatory) ALS registry. Utilizing the national residential
history of MA ALS Registry participants, we will estimate subject exposure to potentially toxic and persistent
elements prior to diagnosis to identify elements associated with increased ALS risk in a case-control analysis
using spatiotemporal geographical information systems (GIS) techniques. In parallel, we will evaluate the
concentrations, combinations and spatial distribution of a suite of elements in disease-relevant brain tissue from
MA ALS Registry patients and non-neurodegenerative MA autopsy controls and correlate these findings to our
GIS studies. We will also characterize the subcellular distribution and composition of nanoparticles in ALS cases
relative to controls. Together, this unique and novel research will identify well-founded, risk-related exposures
for ALS as well as provide novel insight into the etiology of this disease."

Health challenges linked to human aging take a tremendous toll on society. Physical and cognitive decline limit
the quality of life for the elderly and their caregivers. Aging is the major risk factor for, and possible cause of,
cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease. Without question, the promotion of healthy aging with
extended resistance to decline and disease should be a major objective of current medical research.
Fortunately, tremendous progress has been made in the biology of aging field and the science is poised to be
translated into preclinical and clinical science.
Simple animal models such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have been at the heart of this success.
Many genes and chemical compound interventions that modulate aging processes are likely to act similarly in
humans. The goal of the proposed work is to continue, and expand, efforts of a co-operative scientific group
involving three closely interacting laboratories who coordinately test pharmacological interventions for their
ability to extend healthy aging and promote longevity in nematodes. A specific emphasis of this integrated
super-group is to test promising compound on a collection of natural variants of the Caenorhabditis genus,
which together represent the extensive genetic heterogeneity in the human population. The idea is that
treatments that confer positive outcomes across a diverse population will have an increased chance of being
effective in humans.
The emphasis of this specific proposal is to capitalize upon the very high temporal resolution provided by our
automated lifespan approach to expand upon our existing analytical framework to include an analysis of
variation in rates of aging using more general statistical models that allow for changes in the rate of mortality
over an individual’s lifespan. This approach provides a unique hypothesis testing framework that is particularly
well suited for compound interventions. In addition, we will build upon our translational capacity by using RNA-
seq to identify genetic pathways targeted by longevity-extending compounds and to understand which
molecular systems maintain early-life function later in life as a hallmark of healthy aging. Mapping these
changes onto known mammalian genetic regulatory systems will allow us to determine which interventions are
most likely to serve as targets for rapid translation.
Overall, we will participate in a unique team project that has the power to define pharmacological interventions
that robustly promote strong healthspan across a varied population, with implications for development of
therapies that promote healthy human aging."

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a prevalent and deadly cancer, with a predicted 20,000 new cases and 11,000
deaths from AML this year in the US. A common treatment for AML is allogeneic stem cell transplantation
(alloSCT). Though potentially curative, approximately half of all patients that receive alloSCT eventually relapse
and die of their disease. In alloSCT, a patient’s immune system is suppressed and bone marrow hematopoiesis
ablated then reconstituted with donor hematopoietic stem cells and leukocytes. Donor T cells are able to
recognize peptides derived from recipient genetic polymorphisms as foreign and destroy the cells presenting
them. These peptides that differ between donor and recipient are called minor histocompatibility antigens
(mHAs). If mHAs are presented on AML cells, donor T cells will kill the AML cells in what is called the graft versus
leukemia (GvL) effect. However, donor T cells also target peptides presented on healthy recipient tissues causing
a life-threatening side effect called graft versus host disease (GvHD). Separating GvL from GvHD is a pivotal
problem in alloSCT biology. T cell targeting of mHAs that are derived from proteins only expressed in the blood
is viewed as a way to augment GvL without boosting GvHD. We hypothesize that mHAs mismatched between
donor and recipient are a key determinant of alloSCT outcome for AML. In this work, I investigate mHA targeting
in alloSCT for AML from two perspectives: mHA and T cell. My work will elucidate the role of mHAs in alloSCT,
enrich clinical assessment of AML prognosis, and identify new mHAs for future therapeutic targeting. The training
in computational and wet lab immunology included here will forward my goal of becoming an independently
funded physician-scientist leading a research lab in leukemia immunobiology and caring for leukemia patients.
We have computationally predicted mHAs using a large dataset of over 3000 alloSCT patients. In our mHA-
focused Aim 1, I will validate our predicted mHAs using mass spectrometry to identify whether they are presented
on the cell surface of AML cell lines and therefore can serve as targets for T cells. Using the mHAs I validate, I
will statistically define peptide features that predict presentation on the cell surface by HLA, informing future mHA
identification work. I will also assess associations between validated mHAs and clinical outcome after alloSCT.
I will analyze mHAs by population frequency in all ethnic groups within the US, with the goal of identifying a
minimal set of mHAs that cover the majority of AML patients of all ethnicities.
In our T cell-focused Aim 2, we will assess whether T cells specific for mHAs are exhausted in patients
experiencing relapse after alloSCT. We predict that efficacy of these T cells predict success of alloSCT, and that
exhaustion of these cells will accompany relapse. We will investigate presentation of exhaustion markers and
release of proinflammatory cytokines from mHA-specific T cells from alloSCT patients before and after relapse."

 Different facets of stigma (anticipated, enacted, internalized) associated with substance use disorder (SUD)
and with HIV positive status impede cessation of substance use and HIV health outcomes including
antiretroviral therapy adherence and viral load suppression.1-6 Although public stigma is pervasive surrounding
both, individuals can learn to reduce its internalization and mitigate stigma’s negative impacts on their health.
However, interventions promoting this are non-existent in the published literature.
 To this end, we propose to adapt an evidence-based stigma-impact reduction intervention, Ending Self-
Stigma (ESS) to reduce stigma and its negative impacts on health. ESS has shown efficacy in reducing
internalized and anticipated stigma in populations experiencing mental health conditions.7 The 9-session
group-based intervention, which uses cognitive behavioral therapy strategies and social cognitive theory
constructs, employs didactic learning and interactive activities to facilitate reductions in internalized and
anticipated stigma.
 The purpose of the proposed study is to adapt the ESS intervention for people living with HIV (PLWH) who
also have opioid use disorder (OUD) and/or cocaine use disorder (CUD). In the first year, we will use an
iterative process that starts with formative interviews with service delivery key informants and people living with
PLWH with OUD and/or CUD, and ends with two successive pilot studies with the study population. Through
this process, intervention content will be adapted for this population and intervention delivery will be adapted
for a virtual format via a web-based platform. Then, in years 2-3, a small randomized clinical trial of the
resulting Ending Self-Stigma intervention adapted for PLWH with Substance Use disorder (ESS-HSU) will be
conducted with 70 participants to determine its feasibility and acceptability in addition to collecting data on
proximal outcomes including internalized and anticipated stigma, depressive symptoms, anxiety and perceived
stress associated with stigma. We will also measure distal outcomes including ART adherence, viral load and
substance use (SU) at 6-month follow-up.
 The ESS-HSU intervention has the potential for high public health impact by reducing the negative effects
of internalized and anticipated stigma resulting from the pervasive public stigmatization of HIV seropositive
status and SUD on HIV health outcomes and cessation of SU. ESS-HSU would be the first virtual intervention
of this type to be evaluated in a randomized clinical trial. If results are promising, we will seek R01 funding for a
full-scale test of this innovative intervention to determine its effects on a range of health outcomes and
characterize mechanisms of intervention effects."
10896938,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year >500,000 Americans diagnosed with cancer have tumors that could be targeted with an FDA-
approved drug to treat their disease more effectively. However, there is wide variation in use of these treatments
in clinical practice. Rural patients, who are more likely to die from cancer than their non-rural counterparts, are
less likely to receive targeted cancer therapies and could benefit greatly from interventions to address this quality
gap. This study will test the effectiveness of our Multi-TEAM Systems Framework Precision Oncology Reflex
Testing (TEAMSPORT) intervention to standardize delivery of targeted cancer therapy and adapt it for use in
rural and non-rural community cancer programs, where the majority of cancer patients receive their care.
Our experienced multidisciplinary team of molecular pathologists, medical oncologists, rural implementation
scientists, and team system scientists will be augmented by a Community Advisory Board of community-based
pathologists, oncologists, cancer program administrators, and cancer network leaders representing
approximately 1,000 community oncology programs. Together they will ensure the most cutting-edge, evidence-
based precision oncology science will be supported by best practices in effective inter-team coordination and
packaged for optimal uptake by rural and non-rural community cancer programs.
In this modular R01, responsive to NCI priorities to evaluate geographic disparities in technology dispersion and
further team system science, we will conduct an interrupted time series study to test the effectiveness of the
TEAMSPORT intervention on guideline-concordant genomic testing and team coordination. We will
simultaneously work with community collaborators to adapt the intervention to community settings and test its
acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, and adoptability among a large sample of community cancer programs.
This scientific study will result in:
1) An evidence-based toolkit to increase appropriate use of genomic testing and targeted cancer therapy,
 suitable for rural and non-rural community cancer programs
2) One of the first tests of the effectiveness of a multi-team system intervention, and the impact of relational
 coordination, a validated measure of team connectedness, on quality of care
3) Effect sizes of a multi-team system intervention for use in future practice-randomized trials
4) Locally-endorsed, best practice protocols for precision oncology testing and reporting
5) A novel audit and feedback platform for institutions to assess adherence to national guideline recommended
 precision oncology practices
Ultimately, this study has potential to lead to greater job satisfaction among cancer care providers; wider and
more timely use of genomic testing and appropriate cancer therapies; better cancer outcomes for patients;
reduced harms from unnecessary treatment; and a reduction in rural-urban cancer disparities."

Detection of intracellular DNA by the cGAS-STING pathway mediates host defense against DNA viruses,
contributes to specific human autoimmune diseases, and can be harnessed to promote anti-tumor immunity.
The presence of billions of base pairs of genomic DNA in all nucleated cells raises the question of how cGAS
is not constitutively activated. A widely accepted explanation for this is the sequestration of cGAS in the cytosol,
which is thought to prevent cGAS from accessing nuclear DNA. We have found that endogenous cGAS is
predominantly a nuclear protein, regardless of cell cycle phase or cGAS activation status. We show that
nuclear cGAS is tethered tightly by a salt-resistant interaction. This tight tethering is independent of the
domains required for cGAS activation, and it requires intact nuclear chromatin. We identify the evolutionarily
conserved tethering surface on cGAS and we show that mutation of single amino acids within this surface
renders cGAS massively and constitutively active against self-DNA. Thus, tight nuclear tethering maintains the
resting state of cGAS and prevents autoreactivity, revealing a fundamental mechanism that controls the resting
state of cGAS.
 In this grant application, we have developed innovative new tools to define the cGAS nuclear tethering
compartment, quantitate changes in cGAS disposition during DNA virus infection, and explore cGAS-
associated nucleic acids before and after its activation in the context of infection and autoimmune disease. Our
studies will uncover fundamental new aspects of cGAS biology, will identify new targets for therapeutic
modulation of cGAS activity, and will provide new insights into the principles of self/non-self discrimination by
intracellular nucleic acid sensors."
10897013,"Project Summary
 Lung cancer is the top cause of cancer mortality. Despite recent advances, the majority of patients with
lung cancer lack effective therapeutic options, underscoring the dire need for additional treatment approaches.
Genomic studies have identified frequent mutations in subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex
including SMARCA4 and ARID1A in non-small cell lung cancer with a frequency of up to 33% in advanced stage
disease, making it the most frequently mutated complex in lung cancer. Recent reports and our own data have
identified the paralogue SMARCA2 to be synthetic lethal to SMARCA4. However, identifying selective inhibitors
of SMARCA2 has been challenging. Hence, we have developed novel SMARCA2 degrading small molecules
based on the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology. We demonstrated that YD23, our lead
SMARCA2 PROTAC, potently and selectively induces degradation of SMARCA2. We further showed that YD23
selectively inhibits growth of SMARCA4 mutant lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, we showed that YD23 induces
changes in chromatin accessibility only in SMARCA4 deficient cells.
 Taking these observations together, we hypothesize that SMARCA2 degradation using YD23 is an
attractive therapeutic strategy with promising therapeutic index in lung cancers with inactivating mutations in
SMARCA4. The major objective of the proposed study is to provide preclinical evidence to guide future
development of YD23 (or its analogs) in patients with SMARCA4 mutant lung cancer. While we have shown
marked sensitivity of SMARCA4 mutant lung cancer cell lines to YD23, we still do not know the detailed
mechanistic basis for this activity. Hence, we intend to perform gene expression, epigenetic and chromatin
accessibility studies followed by integrative analysis to triangulate on direct target genes whose chromatin
landscape is altered by presence or absence of SMARCA2 in SMARCA4 mutant cancer cells. While our in vitro
cancer cell growth inhibitory studies are encouraging, a systematic exploration in vivo using various orthogonal
model systems is required to aid the preclinical development of SMARCA2 degraders. Thus, we propose to
determine the potential of YD23 mediated SMARCA2 degradation in SMARCA4 mutant xenograft and patient
derived xenograft (PDX) model systems. Due to the unique microenvironment of lung cancer we will also test
efficacy of YD23 in GEM models of lung cancer. Finally, SMARCA2 as a synthetic lethal partner of SMARCA4
has so far been described by in vitro experiments. In vivo genetic validation is critical to unequivocally
demonstrate the requirement of a gene of interest in the development of a genetically defined subtype of cancer.
Thus, we aim to perform CRISPR-Cas9 mediated Smarca2 genetic ablation to determine the extent of its
involvement in the development and biology of Smarca4 mutant GEM models. In conclusion, our study is
expected to provide mechanistic insight into the synthetic lethal genetic relationship between SMARCA2 and
SMARCA4 and lay the foundation for future clinical development of SMARCA2 degraders as therapeutics."
10897501,"Summary
Our laboratory's long-term goal is to understand and characterize the effects of microelectrode implantation,
recording, and stimulation on brain tissue from a physiological perspective in both neuronal and non-neuronal
cells, as well as to improve the biological compatibility, device stability, and performance of neural implants
through the use of advanced materials and tissue engineering approaches. The goal of the parent BRAIN
initiative R01 project is to understand the charge transfer, electrochemical, and biocompatibility properties of
electrodes on the efficacy and safety of microstimulation. Researchers have used microstimulation to infer
functional connections between brain structures or causal links between structure and behavior. Currently,
microstimulation therapy is gaining interest for the restoration of visual, auditory, and somatosensory functions
in addition to applications in bioelectronic medicine. Current neural stimulation parameters and safety limits were
primarily established based on macroelectrodes using postmortem histology. They should be revised for
microelectrodes using technologies that capture dynamic changes to neural tissue health and function. Another
challenge with microstimulation is its susceptibility to host tissue responses. Implantation of electrodes causes
electrode fouling, progressive neuronal loss, and inflammatory gliosis, leading to decreased stimulation efficacy
and increased impedance over long-term implantation. To address these challenges, the specific objectives of
this project are to assess the acute efficiency and safety limits of neural stimulation via different electrode
materials in vivo (Aim 1), examine the effects of stimulation on electrode materials and cultured cells in vitro (Aim
2), and characterize the chronic safety and stability of microstimulation in vivo from different electrode materials
(Aim 3). Diversity Supplement funding is requested to support the research and training of Ms. Anna Kelly who
graduated from the Bioengineering Department at the University of Pittsburgh in 2022. Following her graduation,
Ms. Kelly received one year of support through the Diversity Supplement which allowed her to contribute towards
both acute and chronic mouse studies detailed in the parent award's first and third specific aims. In the acute
studies, microelectrodes were cortically implanted in transgenic mice expressing calcium indicators and
fluorescently labeled microglia. Experiments using 2-photon microscopy to assess stimulation thresholds and
tissue response are ongoing. Ms. Kelly’s independent project explores the response of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB) and vasculature to microstimulation. Specifically, vascular leakage of cells, plasma, and protein, and the
ensuing tissue response. She is also studying the peripheral leukocyte response to electrode implantation and
microstimulation. Ms. Kelly has made excellent progress in this work and with an additional year of support
through the Diversity Supplement, Ms. Kelly will continue to conduct these projects to an endpoint with significant
animal numbers and concrete findings. Additional research experience with a strong likelihood of multiple
publication credits will help to secure her chosen path of entering a top-tier research focused MD program."

Title: Larval Ecology of Invasive Anopheles stephensi in Ethiopia
The invasion and rapid expansion of Anopheles stephensi in Africa have created major challenges
to effective malaria control and elimination in Africa, triggering calls for urgent action to stop its
spread. Since its first detection in Djibouti in 2012, An. stephensi has spread to Ethiopia, Sudan,
Kenya, and Somalia in Eastern Africa and to Nigeria in Western Africa. Modelling studies have
found that most cities in sub-Saharan Africa are highly suitable for An. stephensi invasion. Unlike
native African malaria vectors, such as An. gambiae, An. Arabiensis, and An. funestus, which
reside predominantly in rural areas, An. stephensi mosquitoes thrive in urban environments.
Furthermore, the invasion of An. stephensi has already caused local malaria outbreaks in Djibouti
and Ethiopia. Control of An. stephensi in Africa currently emphasizes larviciding. However,
effective larval control requires addressing major knowledge gaps in the factors regulating An.
stephensi populations as well as where and when to implement interventions. While mapping out
all habitats through visual inspection is infeasible and impractical, machine learning techniques
and models provide an effective approach for mapping An. stephensi larval habitats. The
development of effective machine learning models for larval habitat prediction requires better
understanding of the environmental and biological determinants of larval habitats. To accomplish
these objectives, two aims are proposed: 1) To examine population dynamics and environmental
regulation of An. stephensi, and 2) To develop and validate An. stephensi habitat models. Our
proposed work will have broad implications for the development of larval biological control
strategies to stop the spread of An. stephensi in Ethiopia, and our machine learning methods
utilizing multiscale data is applicable for guiding mosquito-borne disease controls in urban areas
in other countries."
10869432,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Substance use disorders (SUDs) such as addiction to opioids, methamphetamines and alcohol are a
significant burden in the US, affecting almost 50 million individuals annually. Community specialty SUD
treatment programs (“SUD programs”) are a key type of SUD providers and while effective treatments for SUD
exist, significant issues in the organization and delivery of SUD programs (e.g., burnout, turnover) undermine
the delivery of high-quality services. Clinical supervisors are centrally positioned to support SUD
counselors (frontline clinical providers) and ensure high service quality.
In order for clinical supervisors to effectively support counselors, they need evidence-based supervision
strategies. Currently, supervisors in community SUD programs receive very little training, support, and
direction for supervision, and thus their supervision practices are highly variable, raising concern about the
effectiveness of clinical supervision as currently provided in these programs. R3 is an evidence-based
supervision strategy that can help fill the gap. The R3 strategy has been developed for child welfare settings
where it improved leadership, climate, and client outcomes. Based on our preliminary formative work with SUD
providers in Arkansas, the R3 strategy was deemed acceptable and feasible in SUD programs, and had high
perceived potential to improve supervision quality, counselor well-being and performance, and client outcomes.
Participants thought the core components of the R3 strategy were a good fit for SUD settings and would not
require adaptation; however, the language, behavioral examples, and associated materials (e.g., training,
manual) would need to be modified for use in SUD settings.
The goals of our study are to iteratively modify and refine the R3 supervision strategy for SUD settings
(R3-SUD) and pilot it in SUD residential treatment programs using quality improvement and implementation
science tools and approaches. Aim 1 involves partnering with SUD providers to modify and refine the R3
strategy and accompanying materials. Using the Evidence-Based Quality Improvement (EBQI) process, we will
engage SUD partners in a series of collaborative meetings to review and discuss modification to the R3
strategy and related study materials, and to make key decisions. The output of this work will be a refined R3
strategy for SUD settings (R3-SUD). Aim 2 involves conducting two pilot cycles with 8 supervisors and 35
counselors at 5 SUD residential treatment programs to assess R3-SUD feasibility and acceptability, to examine
its impact on key organizational, counselor, and client outcomes, and to document barriers and facilitators for
its implementation and sustained use in routine SUD practice. This study will provide key information to inform
planning and design of a future large scale (fully powered) study to assess the effectiveness of the R3-SUD
strategy in a large sample of SUD programs."
10890882,"The proposed project, “Measurement and estimation of lucidity prevalence in persons with dementia and
neurological disorders” is in response to RFA-AG-20-017 “Lucidity in Dementia (R21/R33)”. Our goals are to
develop further a measure of paradoxical lucidity and to use this measure to estimate the frequency and
correlates of occurrences by interviewing nursing home staff with respect to incidents observed in residents
during the past one-month and six-month periods. In addition, we will refine the definition of lucidity and
develop further a case-adjudication method for lucidity “diagnosis”. We propose to study staff reports related
to 300 residents of one long-term care facility during the R21 phase and 1500 residents from 12 facilities
during the R33 phase. Front line nursing home staff is ideally suited to inform research in paradoxical lucidity,
an understudied phenomenon; likely due to the transience of the incidents and the lack of scientific reporting
channels. The literature extant focuses on anecdotal evidence and case reports. The proposed study
addresses four objectives: 1) develop a measure to assess the occurrence of lucidity, 2) analyze the
psychometric properties of the measure, 3) develop a consensus conference methodology to determine
possible, probable and definite cases, and 4) conduct a local, population-based study of lucidity using direct
interviews with nursing home staff. This study will contribute to remediation of the lack of measurement tools in
the field and provide robust basic knowledge about the phenomenon of lucidity. The proposed study refines
our case finding methodology used in prior epidemiological research in nursing homes to study underlying
latent constructs that are the subject of early-stage research and require definitional clarity. The proposed team
has expertise in measurement and statistics, gerontology, neuroscience, epidemiology, geriatric medicine and
psychiatry (Alzheimer’s disease), psychology, qualitative methods, and congregate care nursing. The aims are:
 Aim 1-R21: Develop a measure to describe episodes of lucidity among individuals with dementia,
neurological and other illnesses and identify individual and episodic characteristics associated with events;
 Aim 2-R21: Develop further a procedure for case conferencing of reported events, using data from a
pilot sample of 300 staff reports linked to 300 unique residents with and without lucidity events residing in a
large 750-bed long term care facility;
 Aim 3-R33: Conduct a retrospective study of lucidity events in 12 long-term care facilities to describe
their characteristics in comparison to residents without an event;
 Aim 4-R33: Determine the prevalence and frequency of events by diagnostic categories;
 Aim 5-R33: Examine the predictors of lucidity and its subtypes.
Findings could result in the development of a case-reporting methodology for use by front-line staff to identify
episodes of lucidity and to characterize lucidity events to inform future research."
10868118,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the Clinical Core is to establish and maintain clinical research infrastructure that
provides deep phenotyping and longitudinal characterization of clinically and ethnoculturally diverse research
participants for the local and wider research communities. Initially funded in 2004, the longstanding central
theme of this ADRC is atypical and early age-of-onset cases and is one of few centers to focus on
frontotemporal dementia, early-onset/atypical Alzheimer’s disease, prion, and now traumatic encephalopathy
syndrome. Chinese and Latino Americans are substantially and meaningfully represented, in alignment with
San Francisco demographics. Participant heterogeneity is deeply characterized using precision medicine tools
to clarify the phenotypes of AD/ADRD molecular subtypes, predictors of disease trajectories, and the neural
bases of cognition and behavior. Cognitive assessments and care models with real-world applicability for early
detection and diagnosis are validated in the Core and extended to real world clinical practice to address major
gaps in care. Core data and participants are readily shared to support impactful AD/ADRD research at UCSF
and beyond. Core faculty offer multidisciplinary mentorship, clinical research rotations, and infrastructure for
carrying out multi-dimensional AD/ADRD research to a large and diverse group of trainees. The Clinical Core
works in close collaboration with all other Cores and serves a central and unifying role in the ADRC. The aims
of the Clinical Core are to: 1) Perform longitudinal evaluation of functionally-intact normal controls, participants
with mild cognitive impairment or mild behavioral impairment, Alzheimer’s dementia, frontotemporal dementia-
spectrum disorder, traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, and prion disease. 2) Carry out innovative and deep
phenotyping to characterize our participants’ clinical presentations and their longitudinal trajectories. 3) Provide
clinical data and well characterized participants for research on aging and dementia to the larger research
community. 4) Support research training. With this renewal, neuropsychologist Katherine Possin, PhD will
assume the role of Core Lead, supported by neurologist Gil Rabinovici, MD and senior advisor Joel Kramer,
PsyD."
10868119,"ABSTRACT
This ADRC has comprehensive and demanding translational research objectives, for which the Data
Management and Statistical (DMS) Core must be able to efficiently collect, validate, integrate, and derive
meaning from a complex array of data. Our key questions about heterogeneity in dementia, as reflected in young-
onset and atypical AD/ADRD, require investigators to examine many complex relationships among clinical
features, natural history, interactions between genotype and phenotype, biomarkers, clinico-pathological
relationships, and connections between brain changes and neurobehavioral disturbances. These research
questions can only be fully addressed with sophisticated and comprehensive data structures, and with the
support of a cohesive team of expert statistical faculty. To facilitate this process, the DMS Core will incorporate
a number of innovative tools that will enable our researchers to better identify and integrate high-quality multilevel
data collected through this ADRC, while linking data with other resources at UCSF and beyond. Historically, the
UCSF Memory and Aging Center (MAC) has shown national leadership in developing neurology-specific data
management and analytic systems that integrate a wealth of information from a variety of sources in order to
better understand the etiology and treatment of dementia syndromes and promote translational research. This
DMS Core would be uniquely positioned to make a national impact on key NIH goals by making tools available
to the ADRC network that are designed to facilitate and accelerate the research process for investigators.
Furthermore, we have assembled a superb team of faculty from the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department
who will provide high quality consultation concerning research design and analysis. Finally, with the help of the
REC Core, this DMS Core is committed to providing quality training and education in effective approaches to
both dataset generation and statistical analysis, not just for our early-career investigators but for ADRC-affiliated
researchers at all levels. Overall, this DMS Core will combine our center’s solid two-decade foundation of
excellent data management and UDS submission practices, with our innovative, custom-built tools enhancing
representation and analysis of multiple levels of neurological information, as well as experienced statistical
guidance that allows investigators to effectively model complex patterns and associations in our patients. We
have structured this DMS core to ensure that these exemplary data management and research methods are not
only successfully coordinated among the other multidisciplinary cores of this ADRC but are effectively taught to
our investigators, freeing them to pursue the answers that will most powerfully impact dementia research and
treatment."

The UCSF ADRC Neuropathology Core (Path Core) provides vital research support to the UCSF ADRC and to
the neurodegenerative disease research community at UCSF and beyond. Neurodegenerative disease
pathology has become increasingly exciting and complex in recent years, with major advances arising from
work accomplished through this ADRC. In this application, the Path Core will continue to be led by Dr. William
Seeley and co-led by Dr. Lea Grinberg. The Path Core aims to: (1) Obtain and bank human brain and spinal
cord tissue for neuropathological characterization and research; (2) Analyze specimens and render
neuropathological diagnoses; (3) Review tissue requests and distribute specimens; (4) Support innovative
neuropathological approaches; (5) Train the next generation of neurologists and neuropathologists conducting
research on neurodegenerative disease. These goals will be accomplished through extensive interactions with
the other cores of the UCSF ADRC and will have a major impact on the overall success of the center."
10868121,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ORE Core functions as bidirectional bridge between our ADRC and the diverse San Francisco Bay Area
(SFBA) communities that are underserved and underrepresented in our center. Our Core works through three
broad pillars of action developed in close collaboration with our community partners: 1) clinical care for adults
with AD/ADRD from vulnerable backgrounds, 2) education on brain health and AD/ADRD for laypersons and
health care providers, and 3) multimodal art- and movement-based engagements for brain health. These pillars
of action serve as the main pipelines of recruitment of cognitively healthy and impaired diverse populations into
our ADRC, including our Chinese American, Latino American and an emerging Black/African American cohorts.
In addition, we promote participant retention through annual research education events tailored to our cohorts,
in which we share individualized research visit summaries that outline the main clinical findings and
recommendations stemming from each research visit with the participants and their primary care providers.
Moreover, our ORE Core has developed an innovative outreach approach that targets communities living in the
most vulnerable neighborhoods of San Francisco, with neighborhood vulnerability measured across various
social determinants of brain health (SDOBH). We couple this outreach approach with our center’s SDOBH
Project, which aims to construct lifetime exposomes of our diverse ADRC participants based on a multidomain
SDOBH questionnaire created by our ORE Core, with the overarching goal of developing individualized
polysocial risk scores linked with specific brain health outcomes, including AD/ADRD. The ORE Core works to
ensure that our center’s Clinical, Imaging, Biomarker, and Neuropathology Cores can characterize ADRD in
historically underrepresented populations while investigating specific associations between SDOBH factors and
imaging, genetic, fluid-based, and neuropathological biomarkers of AD/ADRD. For this cycle, we will strengthen
our outreach and engagement operations to maintain our existing cohorts of Chinese and Latino American
participants from vulnerable backgrounds, while aiming to recruit and retain a cohort of 30 Black/African
American (20 patients and 10 controls) participants form the SFBA. We will strengthen our community based
participatory research approaches by creating three community based advisory boards (CABs) focused on
further understanding and mitigating barriers to research participation Chinese, Latino, and Black/African
Americans from vulnerable backgrounds. Finally, we will strengthen our educational efforts targeting our partner
community clinics through an innovative program aimed at creating awareness of mild cognitive impairment, mild
behavioral impairment, atypical AD, FTLD spectrum disorders, chronic traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, and
prion disease among primary care providers, to improve referrals of these patients to our ADRC."
10868122,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diagnostic, prognostic, and translational biomarkers are urgently needed for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and
Related Dementias (ADRDs). The goal of this Biomarker Core is to maintain a world-class biorepository to
support biomarker discovery in comprehensively characterized AD/ADRD research participants. In the last grant
cycle, this Biomarker Core successfully collected, banked, genotyped, analyzed and disseminated >4,000
human biospecimens. This Core has contributed more samples to the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer’s
Disease (NCRAD) than any other ADRC. As a direct result of these fluid and cell specimens, researchers at
UCSF and beyond have made major contributions to neurodegenerative disease research, including validation
of novel fluid-based biomarkers and new biological and genetic discoveries in AD/ADRD. Moreover, the Core’s
unique Fibroblast Bank, now numbering over 300 lines, provides opportunities for generation of iPSCs and
patient-derived neurons, which are becoming progressively more valuable as the field moves towards precision
medicine approaches. In this renewal, the Biomarker Core will continue its long-standing contributions to the
field by focusing on four critical missions: 1) collection of fluid and cell resources for biomarker discovery, 2)
ensuring standardized biomarker characterization of a diverse cohort of ADRC participants enrolled by the
Clinical Core, 3) expanding the toolbox of novel biomarkers, and 4) enhancing the pipeline of scientists pursuing
biomarker research. Along with an anticipated ~130 annual blood samples and associated biofluids, the Core
anticipates banking ~70 CSF and ~24 fibroblast samples per year. Plasma and CSF for all ADRC participants,
which include a diverse representation of patients diagnosed with atypical and early-onset dementia and from
historically underrepresented populations, will be characterized using the AT(N) system for biomarker-based
classification of amyloid accumulation (“A” via A40, A42), tau pathology (“T” via P-tau181) and
neurodegeneration (“N” via NfL), through the NCRAD project Alzheimer’s Disease Center Fluid Biomarkers.
NCRAD will also provide genome-wide SNP and APOE genotyping for all participants, complemented by whole
exome screening by the Core for established genetic causes of AD/ADRD. Biomarker characterization will be
augmented by measures of plasma and CSF proteins reflecting synaptic and lysosomal functioning, presence
of alpha-synuclein, and glial functioning with collaborator and field leader, Dr. Henrik Zetterberg. All Core
activities position the team to support professional development in biomarker research for Center trainees. This
work leverages a multidisciplinary team: Core Lead and neurogeneticist, Jennifer Yokoyama, PhD; Co-Leads,
clinical trialist Julio Rojas-Martinez, MD, PhD and neuropsychologist Kaitlin Casaletto, PhD; and Project
Manager, neuroscientist Argentina Lario Lago, PhD, all of whom have contributed to biomarker research and
innovation in AD/ADRD. Specimens and data generated by this core will be available for broad sharing and serve
as an invaluable resource for the research community."
10868123,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RESEARCH EDUCATION COMPONENT (REC)
The REC serves a unique role for the UCSF ADRC, functioning as a bridge between the robust resources at our
center and emerging scholars in other UCSF hubs. We host an annual ADRC Dementia Day to bring together
ADRC and non-ADRC researchers from across the UCSF campus, and we maintain programs, including a
month-long behavioral neurology rotation, to expose neurology and psychiatry residents, and other early career
learners, to ADRD research. Through these activities, we identify postdoctoral fellows transitioning to their first
faculty position, and early faculty scholars transitioning to independence, while promoting ADRD research to
attract earlier trainees. Once early career researchers enter our REC program, they benefit from a wide array of
experiences including multidisciplinary mentorship, exposure to diverse topics related to ADRD, leadership
training, grant writing workshops, and meetings with other ADRCs. The REC is headed by leaders with extensive
mentorship and training experience, who represent several disciplines, and research methods (neurology,
geriatric psychiatry, deep phenotyping, imaging, epidemiology, clinical trials, bench models of
neurodegeneration), ensuring that the program meets the needs of its diverse trainees. Thus far, we have
appointed 15 REC scholars from a range of disciplines including clinical Neurology, Medicine, Nursing,
Psychiatry, and basic neuroscience. Seven of the 15 are from NIA-designated groups that are under-represented
in science. In the coming cycle, we will augment our robust programs with additional didactics and conferences,
while expanding outreach to the UCSF community to increase exposure to potential candidates. We will pursue
the following aims: Aim 1: Support career advancement for emerging researchers from a variety of fields
using multidisciplinary mentorship, broad and customized didactics, clinical exposure, leadership training, and
dialogue with other ADRCs. We will also provide each scholar with a $10K stipend. Aim 2: Maintain and expand
outreach to other UCSF programs interested in ADRD research, and potential REC scholars using web-
based communication, conferences, courses, and scholar exchanges to enhance dialogue between our ADRC
and other programs at UCSF, and educate early career researchers about training opportunities in UCSF’s
ADRC. Aim3: Ensure that the REC trains a diverse group of scholars that bring perspectives from groups
who are underrepresented in ADRD research by participating in departmental and university efforts that focus
on workforce inclusion, highlighting diversity in our ADRC faculty, describing programs and research activities
that expand equity and diversity in research, and participating in scholar exchange with UCSF’s Resource Center
on Minority Aging Research. Aim 4: Reach out to early trainees and help them consider a career in ADRD
research by maintaining our month-long rotation in behavioral neurology for neurology and psychiatry residents,
medical students, and geriatric medicine fellows, and creating a minicourse for graduate science students to
acquaint them with current trends in ADRD research."
10868124,"PROJECT SUMMARY – IMAGING CORE (F)
The UCSF ADRC Neuroimaging Core (Imaging Core) is a critical component of the center’s efforts to advance
early and accurate diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease. Through the use of MRI- and PET-based imaging,
we have helped to define the imaging abnormalities that characterize atypical and early age of onset
neurodegenerative disorders, in particular FTD and early-onset AD, and to establish the central role for imaging
in diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementias (RPDs). We have pioneered the use of new MRI techniques, and
new PET ligands, in FTD and AD as they have emerged, and done extensive work correlating these techniques
with other biomarkers, genetics, and neuropathology. Imaging is also a critical component of programs at our
center that combine measures of functional, anatomical, and molecular change with neuroscience-based
assessments to understand changes in language, social-emotional function, visuospatial, executive function,
and other impairments caused by neurodegenerative disease. We have been enthusiastic contributors to
national efforts, including the Standardized Centralized Alzheimer’s and Related Neuroimaging (SCAN) project,
and led national and international efforts to characterize atypical neurodegenerative diseases, including FTD,
atypical and early onset AD, while developing new collaborations to study traumatic encephalopathy syndrome
(TES). For the upcoming cycle, the Imaging Core will continue to support our ADRC by coordinating acquisition,
archiving, and processing of 3T structural and functional MRI, and amyloid, tau, and FDG PET images, making
these images accessible to local and national ADRC investigators, and providing imaging based amyloid, tau
and neurodegeneration (AT(N)) staging data for select clinical populations. We will purse the following aims:
Aim 1: Collection, archiving, and quality control (QC) of MRI and PET images in ADRC participants,
including: MP-RAGE, FLAIR, T2-weighted, diffusion, ASL perfusion, ICN-fMRI, and amyloid, tau and FDG PET
scans. We will upload MRI and PET imaging datasets to the SCAN project. Aim 2: Development and
implementation of standard and innovative analytic tools to characterize disease related changes in brain
volume, white matter microstructure, white matter signal hyperintensity, ICN-fMRI-based connectivity, cerebral
perfusion, and PET ligand binding. Aim 3: Provide AT(N) staging information for ADRC participants who
undergo amyloid and tau PET to the Clinical Core for participant feedback, and to the Data Management
and Statistics Core for analysis. We will use funds allocated for MRI and PET to focus on AT(N) characterization
of Chinese and Latino American participants recruited via the Outreach Recruitment and Engagement Core,
and patients with atypical clinical presentations of AD. Aim 4: Support research training by working with the
Research Education Component (REC) to teach principles of image acquisition and analysis, and clinical
interpretation of amyloid and tau PET scans, and support trainees who wish to incorporate image analysis into
their research."
10864087,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal delineates a five-year individualized training plan that will promote an independent
scientific career to study the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is the most common
sequalae of prematurity and impacts the patient throughout the lifespan. Specifically, the scientific program of
the candidate will focus on how biophysical force affects type 1 alveolar epithelial cell (AT1)-mediated
regulation of the pulmonary matrisome within the developing lung. The applicant is an Instructor within the
Division of Neonatology and Department of Pediatrics at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and has
previous training in cell and molecular biology with an emphasis on oxidative stress. Over the past several
years, she has worked as a clinical research fellow in the laboratory of Dr. Edward Morrisey, a world-renowned
expert in developmental biology and lung regeneration with a phenomenal record of mentorship success. The
goals of this current proposal are to acquire expertise in transcriptomics, epigenetics, and mechanobiology that
will help define her future career as an NIH-funded independent investigator. To meet these goals, her and Dr.
Morrisey have developed a robust training program with coursework and workshops offered by the University
of Pennsylvania and have put together a diverse advisory committee to aid her in her scientific and career
development goals. Together with the outstanding environment offered by CHOP and UPenn, she is well-
poised to launch into a productive and innovative research career as a physician-scientist.
 Recent clinical evidence suggests that the incidence of BPD is increasing as the thresholds of viability
are challenged, but the multifactorial etiology of disease pathogenesis has remained elusive. In addition, there
are no treatment options which can prevent BPD or can promote pulmonary regeneration in affected neonates.
The aims in this proposal will address the central hypothesis that biophysical force promotes AT1 cell
regulation of the alveolar proteosome, in part through upregulation of TGFβ signaling leading to expression of
a constellation of matrisome members that are essential in maintaining alveolar health and function during
neonatal lung growth and maturation. In Aim 1, the candidate will identify how elevated mechanical stress
impacts AT1 cell-mediated regulation of the pulmonary matrisome in both in vivo mechanical ventilation and in
vitro cellular stretch models and examine if its effects are attenuated with loss of TGFβ. Aim 2 will characterize
the effects of mechanical ventilation on the developing lung more globally, with a single-cell approach to
examine the transcriptomic and epigenetic regulatory networks as well as intercellular communication that
predisposes to altered development and BPD. Successful completion of these aims will provide new insight
into how AT1 cells translate applied biophysical force into changes of their own matrisome program to affect
their local environment and communicate broadly with other cell compartments to impact the normal lung
developmental programming."

Cells integrate distinct stimuli through biochemical signaling pathways to induce the appropriate transcriptional
programs. In these signaling-to-transcription networks, the rapid addition and removal of post-translational
modifications impact the activity and specificity of transcription factors (TFs) to inform resultant cellular function.
Understanding how extracellular cues are linked to gene expression is a fundamental challenge in
biology. Existing signaling-to-transcription efforts are often constrained in scope, describing signaling events in
detail with little transcriptional insights, or focusing on a few static signaling features while addressing more
comprehensive genomic questions. My laboratory is addressing this problem in the context of signal transducers
and activators of transcription (STATs), a family of TFs that integrate complex cytokine stimuli to inform a range
of pro- to anti-inflammatory immune programs. We propose both data-driven and mechanistic modeling
approaches to integrate TF dynamics, global phosphorylation, and transcriptomic data to 1) explore signaling
mechanisms that shape stimulus-specific STAT phosphorylation dynamics and functions dependent on these
dynamics, and 2) systematically identify phosphorylation events and STAT-cooperating TFs that predict specific
gene sets. These efforts to link dynamic signaling to gene expression profiles are a step towards identifying and
manipulating the biochemical events required for healthy versus pathology-associated gene expression."

 This application is for an NIDDK K23 award for Dr. Gabriela E. Halder, a Female Pelvic Medicine and
Reconstructive Surgeon (FPMRS) at the University of Texas Medical Branch. Dr. Halder has shown promise
as an early investigator in patient-centered research but needs further training to achieve her goal of becoming
a leader in the use of Human Centered Design (HCD) and Dissemination and Implementation (D&I) methods
to address disparities in access to treatments for urogynecologic conditions. This award will provide protected,
mentored support to obtain the following career goals: 1] acquire proficiency in HCD methods to systematically
design intervention procedures and materials; 2] obtain advanced skills in applying appropriate D&I
frameworks, measures, design methods, and implementation strategies for behavioral interventions; 3] develop
expertise in health equity research methods and outcome measures; 4] develop and strengthen research
leadership, management, and grantsmanship skills. Her mentors for this K23 are Dr. Heidi Brown (Primary), an
NIH NIDDK funded FPMRS and leader in D&I; Dr. Elizabeth Lyons (Co-mentor), an NIH funded expert in HCD;
and Dr. Rebecca Rogers (Co-mentor), an NIH funded FPMRS and leader in patient-centered research. Dr.
Halder also has 4 advisors with expertise in health equity, clinical research, and academic leadership.
Latinas suffer more perioperative complications that their non-Hispanic peers when undergoing
urogynecologic surgery, in part, because of lower surgical preparedness. We previously developed Telehealth
Intervention to Increase Patient Preparedness for Surgery (TIPPS) which is one of the few interventions proven
to successfully increase surgical preparedness for patients undergoing urogynecologic surgery. Unfortunately,
our intervention studied mostly White women, excluded non-English speakers, and was not cost-effective nor
practical. Therefore, there is a gap in knowledge on culturally appropriate, language-sensitive, and sustainable
interventions that increases Latina surgical preparedness for urogynecologic surgery. Dr. Halder’s proposed
research will use HCD and D&I methods to center stakeholder input to develop TIPPS-Latina – a usable and
sustainable intervention that considers the cultural and societal needs of Latina patients and their clinical
environments, an approach not used thus far in development and testing of other surgical preparedness
interventions. Aim 1 will identify factors associated with surgical preparedness using a participatory action
research framework. Aim 2 will use the HCD framework of Discover, Design/Build to develop TIPPS-Latina. Aim
3 will pilot test TIPPS-Latina using a mixed methods approach that determines feasibility and implementation
outcomes.
 The expected outcome of this mentored research is to provide a foundation for a larger randomized
clinical trial that assess the effectiveness of the developed intervention and a successful transition to research
independence for Dr. Halder."

Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging arboviral pathogen and the cause of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in
animals and humans. RVF has been reported across much of the African continent and is designated as a priority
disease by international organizations due to its epidemic potential and the lack of effective countermeasures.
The epidemiology of RVF has particular characteristics, with sudden large outbreaks in animals and humans
occurring in spatially and temporally divergent patterns followed by long periods – called the inter-epizootic or
inter-epidemic periods (IEP) – where disease activity is purportedly inapparent. Yet enhanced surveillance
studies consistently show that the IEP is characterized by continuous disease transmission within susceptible
hosts, and this transmission cycle is hypothesized as one mechanism for RVFV persistence during long IEPs.
To this end, this project aims to gain insight into the inter-epidemic transmission pathways that result in RVF for
livestock and human populations within the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania – where prior work by our One Health
consortium described an outbreak of RVF among cattle that was contemporaneous with severe cases in
humans. This project will: 1) define the prevalence of RVFV for livestock and humans in Kilimanjaro across
different socio-ecological zones (e.g. rural, peri-urban, peri-urban, elevation) and exposures (e.g. socio-
demographics, local mosquito composition and density); 2) systematically survey the milk value chain in
Kilimanjaro to the assess the infectious nature of cow's milk; and 3) leverage data collected during the award
period to construct mathematical models that reconstruct the transmission dynamics and epidemiology of RVF
in Kilimanjaro. Results from this project will identify the pathways that contributes to RVFV persistence during
the IEP and may inform the development of actionable interventions that interrupt this cryptic transmission cycle.
This project has direct relevance to the US NIH's continued efforts to conduct foundational research on emerging
infectious pathogens and the diseases they cause. This career development award will provide the candidate
with expertise in conducting One Health research, and he will acquire advanced skillsets in infectious disease
modeling, all of which are necessary for his long-term career goal to become a leader in advancing understanding
of zoonotic diseases and implementing mitigation strategies to effectively stop disease transmission. The primary
mentor for this award is Dr. Matthew Rubach, an accomplished researcher with substantial experience in
conducting clinical research on causes of severe febrile illness and zoonotic diseases in Tanzania. A
complementary and diverse group of mentors will provide guidance in One Health (Dr. Jo Halliday), veterinary
health (Dr. Gabriel Shirima), and infectious disease modeling (Dr. Paul Johnson). The candidate will use the
outstanding resource and interdisciplinary working groups at Duke University, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical
Centre, and the University of Glasgow to launch his career as an independent physician-scientist."

Epidemiological studies identify early life exposure to pyrethroids as a threatening risk factor for attention-
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Because the reported risk of exposure is within no-observed-adverse-
effect level (NOAEL) guidelines, environmental exposure to pyrethroids could be an underestimated leading
cause of ADHD and other neurodevelopmental disorders in the general population. Animal models of early-life
exposure to the pyrethroid pesticide deltamethrin (DM), a potent neurotoxin that acts on the insect voltage-
gated Na+ (Nav) channel, recapitulates ADHD-like behavior through disruption of dopamine signaling in the
nucleus accumbens (NAc), the brain region implicated in the human disease. Yet, the mechanism of toxicity of
DM in the developing brain has not yet been determined. Recent studies from our group provide evidence for
cross reactivity of DM with the mammalian Nav1.1 channel, an isoform expressed in fast-spiking parvalbumin
(PV) inhibitory interneurons during development. These cells exert a powerful inhibitory control over the output
of the NAc, which, if disrupted, leads to dopamine dysfunction with effects on locomotor activity, attention, and
impulsivity, endophenotypes that characterize ADHD. In supporting studies conducted in an early-life DM
exposure animal model we show regional accumulation of DM and loss in GABA in the NAc/striatum and
demonstrate disruption of PV interneuron firing in the same brain region accompanied by ADHD-like behaviors.
Building on this premise, we propose molecular (Aim 1), functional (Aim 2) and behavioral (Aim 3) studies to
test the hypothesis that the primary mechanism of DM toxicity in the developing brain is to disrupt PV
interneuron function leading to loss of local inhibitory control in the NAc and behavioral phenotypes common to
ADHD. Outcomes of this study will provide new insights into the molecular-based understanding of risk factors
for neurodevelopmental disorders providing guidance for therapeutic development against exposure."
10868579,"This proposal responds to RFA DA-22-010. Progress in the treatment of HIV is undisputed with potent
combined antiretroviral therapy (cART), allowing most individuals to live relatively healthy for decades while
receiving treatment. Although cART can maintain plasma HIV viral suppression to undetectable levels,
discontinuation of cART invariably results in a rapid rebound of plasma viremia. cART’s inability to cure HIV is
due, at least in part, to persistent HIV reservoirs, such as those in the CNS, and to the limited ability of most
ARTs to cross the blood-brain barrier. In addition, because of active infection in the brain, up to 50% of those
infected may develop a spectrum of cognitive, motor, and/or mood problems collectively known as HIV-
Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND). Our long-term goal is to control HIV replication in CNS and to
treat or prevent HAND in people living with HIV (PLWH). Search for new therapeutic agents with more potency
and fewer adverse effects is underway. For example, broadly HIV-neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are a new
class of therapeutics recently recognized to eliminate viremia. Still, due to their large size, these biologics are
even less likely than cART to reach the brain after systemic administration. Therefore, the tools that facilitate
the effective and long-lasting administration of these potent and safe drugs to the brain are urgently needed as
they can solve the challenging problem of the brain’s HIV reservoir. The goal of this proposal is to control HIV
replication in the brain by sustained delivery of bNAbs.Therefore, this proposal is based on the premise that
the inability of cART to inhibit HIV replication in the CNS can be overcome by a complementary strategy that
provides sustained release of highly efficacious bNAbs in the brain. Accordingly, we hypothesize that
sustained release of genetically-encoded HIV bNAbs in the brain by ex vivo engineered and transplanted glial
progenitor cells (GRPs) can suppress HIV replication and decrease HIV-induced neuropathogenesis.
 We assembled an interdisciplinary team with expertise in (i) modeling HIV in mice; (ii) developing HIV
bNABs; (iii) stem cell-based therapy and genetic engineering of stem cells; (iv) image-guided intraarterial
injection for global cell delivery to the brain. In our preliminary work, we have shown that intra-arterially
delivered GRPs can cross the blood-brain barrier, potentially serving as carriers for local production of HIV
bNAbs in brain parenchyma. The main advantage of using GRPs in our proposed studies is their robust
engraftment, differentiation towards oligodendrocytes and astrocytes, and persistence in the brain for months
and even years after transplantation. Thus, it will meet the need for long-lasting effects elicited by bNABs to
prevent HIV replication in the CNS and may help eradicate the CNS reservoir of HIV.
 Overall, we propose an innovative cell-based strategy that addresses poor drug penetration across the
blood-brain barrier to control and eradicate the HIV reservoir in the CNS. If our project demonstrates safety
and efficacy, it could be rapidly translated into the clinical settings, profoundly impacting many PLWH."

Historically, alcohol abuse and alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have been more common in men than women.
However, recent epidemiological data in younger cohorts of women suggest that this gender gap is closing.
Rates of risky/binge drinking in women are going up at a much faster rate than in men, women show a faster
transition from social use to dependence, and women suffer greater alcohol-related health problems. Thus,
identifying sex-specific neurobiological factors that underlie the development of problem drinking could lead to
improved treatment approaches. In particular, women have been shown to have increased craving in response
to alcohol-related cues and stressors relative to men, and neuroimaging studies show that this effect is
associated with differential activation of brain circuits including the amygdala. We have found that female rats
also show a greater relapse-like response to alcohol-associated cues, particularly when combined with an
acute stressor, similar to the human studies. Moreover, we also have evidence for increased glutamatergic
signaling in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of female rats, raising the possibility that alcohol-associated
memories may be more readily encoded in the BLA of females relative to males, and/or that the neurons
encoding alcohol memories are more responsive to acute stress and able to drive activity in circuits controlling
craving and relapse. Importantly, we have previously shown that differences in circulating gonadal hormones
do not mediate the sex difference in behavior, suggesting that fundamental differences at the synaptic or circuit
level underlie differential relapse-like behavior. For example, we have found that glutamatergic synapses from
sensory thalamus to the BLA are critical for the encoding and extinction of cocaine-associated memories, and
that depotentiating these synapses is sufficient to reduce cocaine relapse-like behavior. However, no one has
previously investigated whether alcohol-cue memories are similarly encoded or if there are differences
between males and females in the neural mechanisms mediating alcohol memory formation. Thus, in Aim 1 we
will compare plasticity related mechanisms in the BLA regulating alcohol memory formation and extinction in
males and females. In Aim 2, we will use genetically-encoded calcium indicators and miniature
microendoscopes to image neural activity (calcium signals) in males and females when alcohol-cues are
presented in the presence or absence of acute stressors. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use comprehensive cFos
mapping to determine if males and females engage similar or different circuits during stress+/-alcohol-cue-
induced relapse-like behavior. These results will inform if sex differences are due to altered circuit engagement
that would point to sex specific neural targets for treatment. All together, these studies will provide a
comprehensive analysis of how alcohol-cue memories are formed, modulated by stress, what other circuits are
engaged, and if there are sex differences in any of these neurobiological factors that could explain the
increasing vulnerability of females to alcohol-related disorders."

Diseases caused by the human herpesvirus Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) are widespread and debilitating but
can be limited by using live attenuated VZV vaccines. The varicella vaccine has been hugely successful in the
US, but many countries do not use it widely, some not at all. A high titer version of the same vaccine virus was
then developed to immunize adults to boost VZV immunity and reduce the incidence of Herpes Zoster (HZ),
the result of VZV reactivation from neuronal latency. HZ is debilitating and complicated, most often by chronic
pain that is difficult to treat. HZ remains a public health concern, because most adults harbor wild-type (WT)
VZV in their ganglia and are at risk for HZ, and the HZ vaccines have far from optimal coverage in the target
populations. The live vaccine virus, vOka, needs improvement. It can cause rashes, go latent and cause rare
cases of HZ. It is genetically heterogeneous, with hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
occurring at different parent/vaccine allele frequencies. The basis of virus attenuation is not known. 5 SNPs are
fully or nearly fully fixed for the vaccine allele and are suspected to direct attenuation. Intriguingly, four lie in
the VZV gene encoding IE62, a critical protein that regulates expression of all VZV genes. Excitingly, our data
shows that WT VZV, through its IE62, turns on expression of the stem cell epidermal marker KRT15 in
keratinocytes and skin, while vaccine virus and its IE62 do not. We then found that KRT15 expression in our
epithelial differentiation model is required for VZV replication. Furthermore, KRT15 levels influence the
keratinocyte DNA Damage Response (DDR). Taken together, the data support a global hypothesis that IE62
upregulates KRT15 to control pro-viral aspects of the DDR. vOka is attenuated in skin because its IE62 does
not trigger the upregulation of KRT15 to regulate DDR pro-viral pathways. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will
seek to establish that vaccine SNPs in IE62 underlie growth attenuation in models of skin. First, we will use a
complementation assay to delineate those vaccine SNPs that prevent IE62 from boosting the replication of
vOka vaccine virus in keratinocytes. Second, we will develop WT VZV recombinants that contain ORF62
genes with vaccine SNPs, then quantify their replication in models of skin, including human skin explants. In
Aim 2, we will characterize steps of the novel IE62-KRT15-DDR pro-viral pathway that is differentially regulated
by KRT15 levels and IE62. This includes studying how the IE62 vaccine genotype influences KRT15
transcription; how KRT15 levels affect the DDR and VZV replication; and what components of the DDR are
proviral for VZV in the human epithelial differentiation model. Aim 3 will seek to determine if IE62 specific
SNPs underlie the poor reactivation phenotype of vOka from neuronal latency, using cultured human neuron
models that have successfully modeled VZV latency and experimental reactivation. Together, these studies will
define mechanisms governing VZV attenuation and establish foundations for generating a defined
homogeneous live vaccine candidate that is attenuated in skin and unable to reactivate from the latent state."

Obesity-related metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease, are thought to be caused by low-grade non-infectious inflammation as a result of lipid-mediated immune
cell activation, particularly macrophages. However, it has become clear that focusing on macrophage
inflammatory signaling is overly simplistic and fails to explain the complex relationship between increased
immune cell recruitment to metabolic tissues and disease pathogenesis. Phenotyping of macrophages in adipose
tissue and liver demonstrates induction of a lysosomal lipid metabolism program in diet-induced obesity,
suggesting that macrophage recruitment to lipid-overloaded tissues might be compensatory in nature. If so, then
enhancing a cell-intrinsic program of lipid hydrolysis and metabolism in macrophages should have
beneficial metabolic effects. In preliminary work, we show that overexpression of macrophage TFEB, a master
transcriptional regulator of lysosomal and fatty acid oxidation genes, enhances the ability of macrophages to
metabolize lipids in vitro and ameliorates diet-induced metabolic dysfunction in vivo, presumably because of
reduced fatty acid release from adipose tissue. In this proposal, we will investigate the consequences and
mechanisms by which activating macrophage lysosomal lipid metabolism in distinct macrophage subsets
impacts obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and fatty liver disease. In Aim-1, we will explore the role of TFEB
in adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) in regulating adipose tissue and systemic metabolic function in obesity.
This includes assessing TFEB’s effects on the metabolic handling of lipid-rich exosomes and dying adipocytes
found in crown-like structures. Our findings in mice will also be confirmed in a human population where we will
determine if increased lysosomal lipid metabolism in ATM associates with metabolically normal or metabolically
abnormal obesity. In Aim-2, we will utilize unique genetic models to determine the impact of TFEB in liver
resident Kupffer cells vs. recruited monocyte-derived macrophages on diet-induced steatosis and fibrosis. Taken
together, this proposal will test the hypothesis that induction of a macrophage lysosomal lipid degradation-
mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation gene network via TFEB will enhance macrophage lipid handling and
could be leveraged to treat obesity-associated insulin resistance and fatty liver disease."

 Immune privilege is a term applied to organs such as the eye that have a unique relationship with the
immune response. These sites prohibit the spread of inflammation since even minor episodes can threaten
vision. The breakdown of immune privilege is thought to have serious consequences for the eye; however, in
spite its powerful influence on inflammation we know little about how immune privilege influences retinal
diseases. Müller cells are the major glial cell of the retina that maintain structural integrity. They react in
virtually every eye disease but are strikingly resistant damage; importantly they can suppress inflammation.
Based on this they should be key participants in immune privilege, but this is not understood. The biological
process of autophagy (literally self-eating) is a recycling system that destroys inflammation-inducing cellular
debris to prevent tissue damage. Because immune privilege, Müller cells, and autophagy all have anti-
inflammatory properties, we will test the novel hypothesis that Müller glial cells utilize the autophagy pathway to
support the anti-inflammatory nature of the eye (i.e. immune privilege). We will do this by examining
intraocular inflammation in 2 well-characterized disease models, endotoxin induced uveitis (EIU) and
experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), utilizing mice with autophagy-deficient retinal Müller cells. Since EIU
is mediated by the innate arm of the immune system and EAU is an antigen specific T cell mediated disease
we will get thorough understanding as to how Müller cell autophagy influences different types of immune
mediated diseases of the eye. In Aim 1 we will assess the intraocular inflammatory response in these models
by comparing control mice with mice that have had the essential autophagy genes Atg5 and Fip200 deleted
specifically in Müller glial cells. We will evaluate inflammatory infiltrates, cytokine production, and retinal
integrity in both models. Preliminary data suggests that inflammation and retinal damage are enhanced in the
presence of autophagy deficient Müller cells in both models. In Aim 2 we will we will define the molecular basis
of these enhanced inflammatory response to determine the contribution of autophagy to immunoregulatory
properties of Müller cells in the eye. Studies will include scRNA-seq analysis, examination of the blood retinal
barrier, analysis of the T-cell response in EAU, and morphological analysis. In Aim 3 we will test the idea that
autophagy supports phagocytosis in Müller cells promoting their anti-inflammatory properties using the process
of LC3-associated phagocytosis (or LAP). We will test whether LAP recovers a portion of the vitamin A for the
Müller visual cycle. By elucidating the role of Müller cells and autophagy in immune privilege we will better
understand their influence on ocular inflammatory responses. Thus, rather than just treating inflammation, we
could consider upregulating immune privilege alone, or in combination with other treatments, to target retinal
disease."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease resulting from the loss of dopaminergic
neurons in the substantia nigra. It is the second-leading neurodegenerative disease associated with aging. For
over fifty years, treatment with levodopa (L-dopa), which crosses the blood-brain barrier and is converted to
dopamine (DA), has been used to mitigate the debilitating motor symptoms associated with PD. However, there
are several caveats associated with L-dopa therapy including erratic, “on-off” cyclical relief from motor symptoms,
large individual variability in effective dose, and a loss of efficacy over time. This loss of efficacy necessitates
escalation of L-dopa dosage, with an increased risk of L-dopa induced dyskinesia. One confounding factor in L-
dopa treatment is its metabolism to DA by gut microbiota. DA produced systemically is unable to cross the blood-
brain barrier and is associated with adverse physiological effects. Although aromatic amino acid decarboxylase
inhibitors (e.g., carbidopa) are typically co-administered with L-dopa, they are ineffective against microbial
metabolism. Enterococcus faecalis, a ubiquitous member of the gut microbiome that is primarily responsible for
the bacterial metabolism of L-dopa, expresses a tyrosine decarboxylase (TyrDC) that avidly converts L-dopa to
DA and is only weakly inhibited by carbidopa. In the proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that deletion
of the TyrDC gene from a previously engineered, bacteriocin-expressing strain of E. faecalis will abrogate L-
dopa metabolism, leading to increased L-dopa and decreased DA in the serum, and elevated DA levels in the
brain following oral L-dopa administration. In Aim 1, we will investigate colonization of the mouse gastrointestinal
tract with the newly constructed ΔtyrDC mutant and determine the impact of colonization on L-dopa and DA
concentrations in the blood and brain following oral administration of L-dopa. In Aim 2, we will address the impact
of colonization with the ΔtyrDC mutant on the efficacy of oral L-dopa therapy in alleviating motor deficits and the
development of L-dopa induced dyskinesia in a mouse model of PD. The scientific impact of these studies will
be to further elucidate the effects of gut microbial metabolism on the efficacy of oral L-dopa therapy. There is a
clear unmet need for novel approaches that enhance or extend the usefulness of L-dopa in PD treatment, and
the development of a probiotic that effectively prevents decarboxylation of L-dopa in the gastrointestinal tract
may have significant potential as an adjunct to L-dopa in the management of PD."

Racial/ethnic inequities in chemical exposures from consumer product use are shaped by social-structural
factors and can amplify health disparities across the life course. Intersectionality is an important framework for
understanding and addressing these environmental health inequities since racism, sexism, and other systems
of power and oppression intersect to disproportionately impact Black and Latina women. Intersectionality also
provides a framework for report back of research results to support bidirectional communication and move the
report back field from right-to-know to right-to-understand. We seek to advance methods for sharing of research
results to account for upstream social-structural drivers and support actionable messages that align with
community values. We will leverage the Taking Stock Study, an ongoing community-based, participatory
research study, to address the following aims: 1) analyze community experiences of receiving personalized study
results among Black and Latina women, and through collaborative inquiry, move from right-to-know to right-to-
understand.; 2) develop and test an enhanced report back process for an intervention study that centers ethical
dilemmas, including issues of actionability; and 3) develop a community-level report back toolkit in order to
support grassroots organizations to be better equipped to tackle ethical concerns related to consumer product
exposures, including when there are no safer alternatives. We will recruit participants from the first phase of the
Taking Stock Study who will have already received personalized study results reports to attend community
meetings to learn from their experiences including what they wanted, what they understood, and what was
lacking during the report back process. We will use this feedback and usability testing with a subset of
participants to iteratively refine the personalized study reports generated with Silent Spring Institute’s Digital
Exposure Report-back Interface (DERBI) for the second phase of Taking Stock, which is an intervention study.
We will test the refined reports among Taking Stock participants by evaluating environmental health literacy
outcomes, including knowledge, understanding and motivation to act before and after receiving DERBI reports.
Findings from individual-level report back will then inform community-level report back, which will be developed
collectively with community partners. We expect to develop new frameworks, tools, and empirical evidence on
how to center principles of intersectionality in report back of environmental health data, and how to advance a
right-to-understand report back paradigm to support health equity."

 Pancreas adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States
and remains among the most lethal cancers with an expected 5-year survival of <10%. Environmental
exposures to chemicals such as those found in cigarette smoke, Agent Orange (dioxin; TCDD) and diet may
underlie a continued rise in PDAC incidence in veterans through unknown mechanisms. Strong evidence
implicates chronic inflammation as the link between exposure to toxins and PDAC tumorigenesis though the
exact mediators remain unknown. Interleukin-22 (IL22) has emerged as an important cytokine in host defense
and tissue repair in the pancreas. Although generally protective, chronically elevated levels have been
implicated in development of dysplasia and cancer. A defining feature of IL22-producing cells is their reliance
on the toxin binding, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), thought to represent an “environmental sensor” of the
immune system, and recently implicated in increased pancreatic IL22 signaling. We recently discovered that
AhR ligands promote IL22 production which can induce early malignant transformation of pancreatic epithelial
cells through enhancement of ERK signaling positioning IL22 as the possible missing link in toxin mediated
carcinogenesis. Important questions remain unanswered including the critical immune components in IL22
secretion in physiologic and pathologic states. Also unknown is the target of cytokine signaling with previous
reports of activity in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Little is known about reliance of tumors on sustained
IL22 signaling for persistence and growth, a factor that has important therapeutic implications. In this research
proposal, we will use reporter mice to identify the cellular sources of IL22 in both the normal and cancerous
pancreas and define the role of AhR ligands in activating these cells. We will also investigate the principle
target of IL22 signaling in the pancreas as this could provide greater insights into the AhR/IL22 axis during
tumor development. Finally, we will determine if AhR blockade could serve as a clinically useful method of
disrupting toxin mediated tumorigenesis. Successful completion of this proposal will uncover an important link
between environmental exposures, inflammation and cancer formation and identify a novel mechanism by
which tissues interface with toxins in the microenvironment. Development of a strategy to decrease a factor
previously identified as a causative agent in chronic pancreatitis and cancer formation will have direct
translatability to veterans with PDAC as well as other exposure-related malignancies."
10890076,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals inherit one copy of each chromosome from each parent. However, the parental genomes within
offspring are not functionally equivalent due to genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon in which certain
genes are expressed from only one parental copy. Imprinted genes are widely expressed during development
and play important roles in growth and neurodevelopment. Genomic imprinting increases disease susceptibility:
genetic disruptions in the only expressed parental copy can result in imprinted disorders with frequent metabolic
and neurodevelopmental symptoms. The Whipple lab seeks to determine (i) the molecular mechanisms
regulating imprinted gene expression, including cell type-specific imprinted expression, and (ii) the cellular and
physiological functions of imprinted genes, with a focus on imprinted non-coding RNAs. Fundamental discoveries
related to genomic imprinting is expected to inform better treatments for imprinted disorders, as previously
experienced in Angelman syndrome.
(i) Using neuron differentiation as a model system to understand cell type-specific imprinted expression, the
Whipple lab has recently identified parent-specific chromatin structure in the Kcnk9 imprinted domain that is
strengthened during differentiation. This work will be extended to comprehensively quantify differences in the 3D
folding of maternal and paternal alleles across imprinted domains. Future experiments will then probe the
functional relationships between epigenetic modifications, chromatin structure, and gene expression in different
tissues and cell types. (ii) Regarding the function of imprinted non-coding RNAs, the lab will primarily focus the
next five years on discovering the targets and functions of imprinted small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). snoRNAs
typically guide chemical modifications on complementary RNA targets, but the targets of imprinted snoRNAs
have largely evaded scientists for the past twenty years. Moreover, loss of paternally expressed snoRNAs are a
major cause of Prader-Willi syndrome. The lab is developing new transcriptomic tools to discover snoRNA:target
interactions, including an optimized snoRNA-RNA chimeric ligation approach for directly sequencing snoRNA
targets. These findings will then be used to better understand the cellular and physiological effects of imprinted
snoRNA activity and the pathways under parental influence in offspring.
Through these efforts, the Whipple lab expects to uncover principles regarding epigenetic control of gene
regulation and chromatin organization that broadly apply across diverse cell types, tissues, and organisms. The
lab also expects to find new non-coding RNA functions with direct implications for understanding the biological
processes dysregulated in imprinted disorders."

Across the tree of life species interact. This includes interactions between animals and microorganisms that
colonize them. Many animals harbor microbes inside their cells and form endosymbiotic associations.
Endosymbionts can have profound effects on host biology and fitness, but the consequences of these effects
depend on endosymbiont prevalence in host populations. While some endosymbionts evolve obligate
relationships, many associations are facultative, with both infected and uninfected host individuals. Wolbachia
bacteria play both roles, but they usually form facultative relationships with arthropods. Indeed, facultative
Wolbachia variants infect most insects making them the most common endosymbionts in nature. Despite this
taxonomic prevalence, Wolbachia frequencies vary widely within and among host systems. The mechanisms
underlying this variation remain unknown. Filling this gap in knowledge is crucial to understand the abundance
of Wolbachia in nature and to improve the efficacy of Wolbachia biocontrol, where vector-control groups are
attempting to establish pathogen-blocking Wolbachia variants in mosquito populations to reduce human
disease transmission (particularly dengue). To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms
that govern Wolbachia spread, research in our lab will advance in three directions. First, many Wolbachia
cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that kills embryos when infected males mate with uninfected females.
This promotes Wolbachia spread in natural and in vector systems. However, CI-inducing males rarely kill all
offspring when mated with uninfected females such that CI strength varies from very weak (most eggs hatch)
to complete (no eggs hatch). We will determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for this variation.
Second, while Wolbachia are maternally transmitted, transmission rates vary significantly. We recently
discovered that cold temperatures disrupt maternal Wolbachia transmission. We will leverage this discovery to
dissect the cellular-genetic basis of transmission rate variation. Third, our research has demonstrated rapid
Wolbachia host switching with Wolbachia that diverged thousands of years ago infecting hosts that diverged
many millions of years ago. This implies that Wolbachia regularly occur at initially rare frequencies in novel
host species and must increase host fitness to spread and ultimately establish. We will compare effects of
“old” and “young” infections on host fitness—in both natural and divergent host backgrounds—to quantify how
much Wolbachia may diverge and still successfully spread in novel hosts. Together, these projects will
leverage nearly 50 million years of Wolbachia divergence distributed across the Drosophila genus to
understand the mechanisms that govern Wolbachia spread. More broadly, this research will promote a deeper
understanding of the causes and consequences of endosymbiont prevalence in nature."

molecular, cellular, systems, engineering and clinical investigation of both vascular and cardiac diseases. By
capitalizing on the existing strengths of our faculty in basic, preclinical, and translational cardiovascular
research, and unique academic resources at the University of Michigan, we will train students not only in state
of the art biomedical research, but also in applying systems biology for preclinical testing, navigating regulatory
compliance, and the process and challenges of research entrepreneurship. Therefore, this program offers
students a unique comprehensive and immersive educational experience in translational research training.
The added benefit is that the program will also prepare students for the diversity of scientific careers available
to and often pursued by young scientists including academic research, start-up companies, biotechnology and
large pharmaceutical and device companies. The Translational CVRE program will attract trainees at the PhD
Candidate level from laboratories across the Frankel Cardiovascular Center faculty membership, from
exceptionally strong graduate programs in the medical school wide Program in Biomedical Sciences, and the
College of Engineering and School of Pharmacy. Funds are requested for 5 trainee slots per year, and
students may be reappointed for a second year by competitive renewal. The key program features are 1)
strong, fundamental basic research training on translationally relevant research topics under the
NHLBI mission 2) training in preclinical research design and phenotypic testing 3) didactic and
experiential learning on research entrepreneurship along with career path relevant skills
development. By placing students at the interface between basic cardiovascular research, biomedical
engineering, and cardiovascular medicine, we hope to better prepare the next generation of PhD scientists to
be leaders at taking basic research discoveries and being capable of directing their path to the clinic."
10890089,"ABSTRACT OF RESEARCH PLAN
Allogeneic Human MEsenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) Injection in Patients with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome
(HLHS): a Phase IIb Clinical Trial (ELPIS), requires a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for project 1)
coordination, 2) administration, 3) data management, and 4) biostatistical support. ELPIS is designed to
determine the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment in HLHS patients undergoing the stage II
operation by determining the improvement of right ventricular function as measured by the diastolic mass
indexed on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI). DCC support of ELPIS will be accomplished through
the following four specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Provide Project Coordination: In consultation with the Clinical
Coordinating Center (CCC) PI and NHLBI, the DCC will jointly develop metrics for the CCC, DCC and
clinical centers to gauge and direct the proficiency and progress of all ELPIS operations required for the
study's successful design, execution, and completion according to project milestones. DCC will also
coordinate all meetings involving CCC, NHLBI, Data and safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), and the clinical
centers, including but not restricted to governance. (Steering/Executive), ancillary/substudy, endpoints,
operations, publications, and adherence subcommittees. Specific Aim 2: Provide Project Administration: The
DCC, in alliance with the CCC, will create and distribute a policy manual for ELPIS containing all requisite
rules and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the safe conduct of the trial and to guide interaction
between the DCC and CCC, as well as the relationships between these bodies, the Steering Committee,
the Executive Committee, the clinical centers and the core laboratories. In addition the DCC will develop an
organization/communication plan that will guide the regular and frequent review of study goals (e.g.,
recruitment and endpoint collection), milestones, timelines, study and budget management, and overall
strategy. Specific Aim 3: Provide Project Data Management: The DCC will provide all necessary statistical
and logistical support for the CCC as the two groups work to follow the progress of the trial. Recruitment
rates, adverse events, protocol deviations, missed visits, adherence rates, loss to follow-up, etc. will be
jointly monitored, collectively discussed, and a single plan of action diligently prosecuted by both in
accordance with NHLBI procedures and policies. The DCC will provide a website application whose content
aligns with the CCC needs and requirements. Specific Aim 4: Provide Project Biostatistical Support: The DCC
will contribute to the development and study design (particularly statistical analysis) with state of the art
statistical evaluations for each of the declared endpoints of ELPIS. When the DCC fulfills its requirements in
collaboration with the CCC, we will be able to answer this important research question to determine the
efficacy of MSC's for HLHS patients for a primary endpoint with clinical relevance to this patient population."

Individuals with severe disabilities who cannot use speech to communicate and use augmentative and alternative
communication (AAC; pointing to pictures, using a speech-generating device) are at high risk for life-long health
issues that are exacerbated by illiteracy and limited communication skills. Over 90% of these individuals leave
high school illiterate, resulting in reduced communication skills and a higher probability of life-long health issues.
Our long-term goal is to improve literacy outcomes in individuals who use AAC, and in doing so, improve health
and well-being outcomes. Daily instruction in literacy practices that are evidence-based have the potential to
change the current poor outcomes, yet limited effectiveness research exists related to literacy interventions that
include phonics-based tasks that are adapted specifically for individuals who use AAC. To improve reading
outcomes, it is essential to explicitly teach how sounds in words work (phonemic awareness) and how those
sounds connect to letters they see in print (phonics). Yet, the majority children who use AAC are provided literacy
instruction solely in sight words using memorization strategies. The ALL (Accessible Literacy Learning)
technology has the potential to improve early literacy skills. It is an evidence-informed literacy curriculum that
includes literacy instruction specifically adapted for individuals who use AAC. Research using components of
the ALL curriculum have been conducted, yet prior to our pilot studies, no research has been conducted with the
ALL technology. There is a critical need to understand the effectiveness of literacy interventions that are
specifically adapted for individuals who use AAC. The objective of this application is to examine the efficacy and
feasibility of the ALL technology on a larger-scale through these aims: (1) Assess the effectiveness of the ALL
technology on six early literacy skills for children ages 4-10 who have intellectual and developmental disabilities
and use AAC, and, (2) Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and adoptability of literacy lessons using the ALL
technology to evaluate components that are helpful or hindering to adoption of the ALL technology. The proposed
research will make important advances in the science associated with teaching children who use AAC how to
learn to read. This project is innovative in three ways: (1) the ALL technology provides phonemic and phonics-
based literacy instruction to a population that does not typically receive this instruction due to their inability to
speak; (2) the intervention targets multiple literacy skills, which may contribute to better literacy outcomes.
Teaching multiple skills during a lesson could potentially improve both the rate and the amount of literacy skills
acquired; and, (3) the ALL technology uses automated data-driven decision making with materials adapted for
individuals who use AAC – addressing many implementation challenges documented by service providers. The
expected outcomes of the project include efficacy of the ALL technology, as well as sufficient data in six early
literacy skill areas; foundational for a future R01 that improves the provision of evidenced-based literacy and
maximizes literacy outcomes for children who use AAC."
10890798,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The brain is the most frequent site of crippling and incurable human disease. Neurosurgeons are ideally
positioned to advance and translate neuroscience discoveries, but it is a stark minority that are able to build a
career as a physician-scientist successfully. Training programs, including our own, have been deficient in their
provision of three essential components to delivering neurosurgeon-scientists to the field: 1) Opportunity; 2)
Mentorship; 3) Continuity.
 We have examined the difficult truth of poor productivity from our prior R25 awardees, dissected our
failures, and designed new and innovative programmatic approaches, specifically molded to 1) expand
opportunities; 2) re-address mentorship; and 3) redefine entirely the look of sustained departmental
commitment to developing and maintaining neurosurgeon-scientists. Herein, we offer a fresh enthusiasm,
focus, and approach for addressing the problem of how to deliver and sustain neurosurgical research
contributions.
 The program proposed here provides a unique and organized approach to engage, support, and maintain
neurosurgery trainees in mentored research. Our hypothesis is that implementation of a formal physician-
scientist training track, coupled with a committee-based mentored research experience and an unprecedented
commitment to longitudinal support for trainees who secure funding will result in improved realization of
independently-funded academic careers for neurosurgeon-scientists. Toward that end, our Specific Aims are to
optimize/provide:
1. Opportunity. Our neurosurgery residency has been re-designed to include a Physician-Scientist Track
that proffers a weekly Academic Day during junior residency, a PhD-thesis style Research Mentorship
Committee, a core curriculum, a vetted and reviewed R25 application, mentored/supported research PGY
years 4-6, and a 7th “transition to practice” year that teaches trainees to divide time successfully between
clinical and research responsibilities.
2. Mentorship. Physician-Scientist Track residents will identify a primary research mentor from among 29
approved Duke faculty mentors grouped into 9 distinct Research Concentrations. A PhD-style Research
Mentorship Committee will be formed to mentor the resident throughout training.
3. Continuity. R25 recipients will receive matched funds from Neurosurgery to support their research
endeavors during the clinical years separating their R25 award in PGY4 from the PGY7 “transition to
practice” year."
10890803,"The overall goal of this proposal is to develop new chemical technologies based on ring-forming reactions of
oxyallyl cations followed by fragmentation of the resultant products to deliver novel molecular entities that are
of biomedical interest. This contribution is significant because it will fuel cross-disciplinary discoveries by
providing synthetic approaches to structurally unique indolines alkaloids with important biological properties.
This project is innovative because we will develop a unified strategic vision for making both our target
molecules and also compounds belonging to several important classes of monoterpene indoline alkaloids.
Thus, we will pursue the following three specific aims. Aim #1: Complete the total synthesis of
strychnochromine and cabucraline, Aim #2: Develop an efficient route to structurally-informed vinblastine
variants with a novel C7 carboxylate, and Aim #3: Invent new (3+2) annulation and Beckmann fragmentation
reactions. Strychnochromine is the only molecule found in nature or of anthropogenic origin that possesses
the densely-functionalized pentacyclic ring system comprising its core. It was found to have anti-protozoal
activity and no total synthesis of strychnochromine has been reported to date. Cabucraline is an akuammiline
alkaloid that is distinct from all the other members previously synthesized at the configuration of the C2
stereocenter, and it has never been made before. Its synthesis will require the development of a novel
regioselective (3+2) annulation reaction with a heterocyclic oxyallyl cation. The proposed vinblastine analogue
is unique by virtue of the unprecedented C7 carboxylate and structural modifications at C3−C5. Natural
vinblastine is an anti-cancer drug that is on the WHO list of essential medicines, but its clinical use is
accompanied by undesirable side-effects. In addition, vinblastine-resistant cancer cell lines are becoming
increasingly problematic. Due to its predicted greater efficacy, we hypothesize that these variants may require
smaller therapeutic dosages vis-à-vis vinblastine, thereby resulting in lower occurrences of adverse side-
effects. Structural differences of the analogues may also address issues related to vinblastine resistance. All
of the proposed syntheses in the first two specific aims will feature the novel dearomative (3+2) indole
annulation followed by fragmentation discovered by our research group. In the third aim, we seek to develop
strategies that significantly broaden the scope of our dearomative (3+2) annulation technology by applying
innovative methods for generating key reactive oxyallyl cation intermediates. In short, we will invent new
tandem processes that result in the formation of densely-functionalized tetrahydrocarbazoles products with
unique and stereodefined substitution patterns."

This application responds to RFA-CA-20-001 and will establish a HIV-Associated Malignancy Research Center
in the U.S. and Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) named the UNC-Malawi-South Africa Cancer
Consortium (UMSACC). This is a collaborative research center between sites in the USA, Malawi, and South
Africa and builds upon strong prior collaborations. The Analytical Core is led by a team of leaders including Dr.
Andy Olshan (USA), Dr. Maganizo Chagomerana (Malawi), and Dr. Charles Chasela (South Africa).
All core leads have strong track records in study design, data analysis, and manuscript writing, and have
played key roles in supporting in-country research activities. This is an optional core prioritized by consortium
partners to provide analysis support and training to US, Malawian and South African investigators. Supporting
the Analytical Core are also an established group of faculty at UNC-CH, Malawi and South Africa, who have
been enlisted to provide mentorship in key areas prioritized by consortium partners, and as required for the
specific projects proposed. The Analytical Core will conduct analyses to support the research projects, assist
Malawi and South African researchers to develop and advance their analytical skills through various training
activities, and disseminate findings from consortium-sponsored research. The core's activities will take place in
close collaboration with the other administrative and mentoring cores for the consortium, and will assist in
building human research capacity and maximizing scientific outputs from UMSACC."
10893594,"Project Summary
Cancer develops and ultimately flourishes due to both the nature of the tumor cells themselves as well as the
microenvironment or ‘soil’ in which the tumor thrives. Multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that results from
mutated plasma cells, grows in the rich soil of the bone marrow causing breakdown of the bone. The risk of
developing myeloma is greater in older individuals and people with high body mass index who also typically
have more bone marrow adipose tissue, or fat, than younger or leaner individuals. However, the relationship
between bone marrow adipocytes (fat cells) and myeloma cells, as well as the specific mechanisms by which
bone marrow adipocytes modulate myeloma disease progression are not well understood. Therefore, we aim
to identify novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients by unlocking new
vulnerabilities specific to the interactions between myeloma cells and bone marrow adipocytes, which can
serve as a source of fatty acids and pro-myeloma cytokines. Our cell culture studies suggest bone marrow
adipocytes induce drug resistance in myeloma cells- recapitulating a common problem for myeloma patients.
We have found that one mechanism of cross-talk linking adipocytes with myeloma cells is through proteins
called fatty acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and FABP5). We will analyze how bone marrow adipocytes
contribute to myeloma by using novel, three-dimensional (3D), tissue engineered cancer models which
consist of bone marrow adipocytes and myeloma cells grown together on silk scaffolds. By growing myeloma
cells in these 3D mini-bone environments, we can determine how myeloma cells change in response to
adipocytes and discover new ways to target this interaction. We will also use our novel mouse models to
study bone marrow adipocyte- myeloma crosstalk by increasing or removing bone marrow adipocytes in mice
and quantifying effects on tumor growth and drug resistance. We will use these in vitro and in vivo models to
specifically test the role of FABP4 and FABP5 in tumor progression and drug resistance, and work toward our
long-term goal to better understand the molecules and mechanisms driving multiple myeloma growth in the
bone marrow, and how cancer hijacks this niche for its own purposes. This proposal supports this endeavor
by providing support for a Research Specialist to further develop, lead, and execute the experiments
described which interrogate a novel part of the cellular “soil” (the bone marrow adipocyte), in which tumor
cells, or “seeds” land and grow."
10893597,"Despite the positive impact that checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy has had on the field of
oncology, the majority of our cancer patients do not respond to this treatment strategy. It is clear
that a more complete understanding of these mechanisms driving resistance to checkpoint inhibitor
immunotherapy will lead to the development of more effective immunotherapy regimens and to
improved patient selection for specific therapies. However, our understanding of active tumor-
mediated resistance mechanisms that are more responsive to pharmacologic targeting remains
poor. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are an immunosuppressive cell population that
have been correlated with inferior responses to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Using pre-clinical
models of different tumor types as well as clinical specimens harvested from melanoma patients,
we have found that resistance to anti-PD-1 antibody (ab) immunotherapy is associated with the
recruitment of granulocytic MDSCs (PMN-MDSCs) into the tumor bed. Subsequent mechanistic
studies were conducted to understand the molecular underpinnings for this accumulation of PMN-
MDSCs in tumors undergoing checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy which noted that CXCR2-
dependent chemokines are upregulated in response to a Wnt5a-YAP1 signaling axis and that this
pathway is triggered by the release of heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) by tumors in response to
CD8+ T cell activation. Using a genome-wide CRISPR screen, we have determined that the tumor
NLRP3 inflammasome is essential for the induction of this signaling cascade and the ultimate
recruitment of PMN-MDSCs to the tumor bed. Based on this cumulative data, we hypothesize
that the adaptive recruitment of PMN-MDSCs and its subsequent suppression of effector T cell
activity in response to anti-PD-1 ab immunotherapy is mediated by activation of the tumor NLRP3
inflammasome via tumor intrinsic PD-L1 signaling. We further propose that the pharmacologic
inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome will enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 ab immunotherapy
in an autochthonous model of BRAFV600E melanoma and that genetic mutations impacting this
pathway can lead to differential responses to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. In addition to
modeling specific gain-of-function NLRP3 mutations in pre-clinical melanoma models, we will
also leverage an ongoing clinical protocol designed to harvest tissue specimens from melanoma
patients, enabling the association of NLRP3 genetic mutations and expression levels, PMN-MDSC
tumor infiltration, and clinical response to checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Overall, this
study promises to contribute significantly to our understanding of adaptive resistance to anti-PD-
1 ab immunotherapy in cancer."
10893604,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) nearly doubles progression-free survival and increases
overall survival when added to endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The growing incidence of MBC
among younger women highlights the need to optimize adherence to complex medication regimens proven to
increase survival. The complex dosing schedule of CDK4/6is along with high cost is thought to contribute to
non-adherence. There is limited evidence on the impact of CDK4/6i nonadherence on survival, symptom
burden, or quality of life. As healthcare transitions to a greater dependence on telemedicine, and with the
increasing penetration of text-enabled mobile phones across every segment of the population, we propose to
test an innovative personalized multilevel mHealth intervention to improve CDK4/6i adherence by conducting a
randomized controlled trial of a CONnected CUstomized Treatment Platform (CONCURxP) versus enhanced
usual care (EUC). The CONCURxP trial will recruit 390 English- or Spanish- speaking adult women with HR+
HER2- MBC and a new prescription for a CDK4/6i, who have a mobile phone with text messaging and are
treated in one of the participating NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) practices. To
objectively measure CDK4/6i adherence, all enrolled patients will receive a smart pillbox. CONCURxP arm
patients in addition to usual care will: (1) receive automated text reminders for missed or extra doses that are
signaled by the smart pillbox; (2) respond to text messages citing the reason for each incident of CDK4/6i non-
adherence; and (3) can view dosage history on a study web-portal. Missed or double doses beyond a
predefined threshold will trigger an email notification to a designated member of the oncology provider team,
who will be prompted to contact the patient to address the issue to close the communication loop. If
nonadherence is due to cost, providers will be trained to refer patients to the Patient Advocate Foundation, a
national non-profit financial navigation program. EUC patients will have access to educational materials to
improve side effect management. Patients will receive the interventions for 12 months and complete surveys at
baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. Our goals are to: (1) compare CDK4/6i adherence; and (2)
patient-reported outcomes (PROs) including symptom burden, quality of life, patient-provider communication,
self-efficacy for managing symptoms, and financial worry at 12 months between CONCURxP and EUC arms;
(3) use mixed methods to describe the patient and provider experience with the CONCURxP intervention; and
(4) explore healthcare utilization, progression-free, and overall survival at 12 months in CONCURxP patients
compared to EUC. The primary endpoint is adherence at 12 months, defined as the proportion of days patients
took CDK4/6i according to the prescribed frequency, measured by pillbox. Our novel multilevel mHealth
intervention will provide valuable and actionable results to improve health outcomes and patient experience."

This multiple-PI R01 proposal is designed to incorporate both in vitro and in vivo approaches to elucidate the
role of the NRF2-ACSS2 axis in alcohol-induced metabolic reprogramming and esophageal pathology. We
hypothesize that the NRF2-ACSS2 axis mediates metabolic reprogramming in alcohol-associated esophageal
pathology. We will test this hypothesis using human cells and genetically modified mice through three
independent and complementary Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize the role of NRF2-ACSS2 axis in
mediating alcohol-induced metabolic reprogramming in human esophageal squamous epithelial cells in vitro. In
Aim 2, we will validate the role of the NRF2-ACSS2 axis in mediating alcohol-induced metabolic
reprogramming in mouse esophagus in vivo. In Aim 3, we will examine the inhibitory effects of NRF2 and
ACSS2 inhibitors on alcohol-induced metabolic reprogramming and esophageal pathology in vivo. If the
hypothesis proved to be true, these studies will lay down a solid mechanistic foundation for NRF2/ACSS2
inhibition as a novel mechanism-based preventive measure against alcohol-associated esophageal pathology
in the future."

 This competitive renewal of “MESA-MIND” (R01AG058969) is a cooperative and multi-disciplinary project
ideally positioned to fill critical gaps in our understanding of both the vascular contributions to cognitive
impairment and dementia (VCID) in context of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related disorders (ADRD) and the
noted the health disparities in VCID and AD/ADRD. This project is an extension of the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA), a large multi-ethnic cohort of 6814 adults now 65 and older (self-reported: 38% White,
28% Black, 22% Hispanic, and 12% Chinese Americans) with deep subclinical vascular phenotyping and stored
plasma over the past two decades. Through initiation of MESA-MIND’s cognitive and imaging visits, we have
demonstrated excellent feasibility to recruit MESA participants into a multimodal and multilingual ADRD research
study more than 15 years after MESA baseline. The primary focus of MESA-MIND remains to define the
subclinical vascular contributions to changes in AD/ADRD biomarkers and cognitive phenotypes of impairment.
In MESA-MIND, we have shown that subclinical biomarkers of arteriosclerosis and atherosclerosis were
associated with imaging biomarkers (MRI and PET), cognitive decline, and cognitive impairment. These
peripheral vascular and imaging biomarkers of vascular disease tend to be higher in men, as well as self-reported
Black and Hispanic older adults; differences that were partially explained by social determinants of health. MESA
has recently built the infrastructure to define the temporal sequence of molecular dysregulation with longitudinal
plasma AD biomarkers and ‘omics data over two decades. This renewal cycle seeks to make major strides in
our mechanistic understanding of structural, functional, and molecular drivers of “subclinical VCID” by: (1)
leveraging MESA’s longitudinal and extensive subclinical vascular biomarkers paired with recent advancements
in high-throughput plasma AD biomarkers, proteomics and metabolomics technologies applied to MESA and (2)
expanding these data resources through two new exams (“MIND C” and “MIND D”) over the next 5 years. These
new resources will enable examination of the molecular (genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic) aspects shared
by vascular disorders, AD biomarkers, and cognitive phenotypes as well as the temporal sequence of transition
from subclinical disease to clinical phenotype. Each research question in MESA-MIND is designed to consider
the consistency of subgroup analyses by gender, racial, and ethnic groups to characterize the health disparities
in VCID/AD/ADRD in the context of social determinants of health."
10885605,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than one-third of the one million older adults living in assisted living (AL) communities in the United States
have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD). An estimated 40% of persons with ADRD
will die there with an average length of AL stay of 2.5 years, making AL a common site for end-of-life care. The
AL nursing workforce, comprising close to 300,000 full-time employees, is challenged to meet end-of-life ADRD
care needs. Advance care planning (ACP) discussions are a foundational aspect of care yet can be challenging
for persons with ADRD due to a lack of decision-making capacity. Staff in AL have limited education and
knowledge about ACP discussions with people with ADRD and their families. Our NIH Stage 1b feasibility cluster
randomized trial of the Palliative Care Education in Assisted Living for Dementia Care Providers (PCEAL-DCP)
intervention pilot study in 10 Als, with AL nurses and administrators, indicated that education with a focus on the
principles of ACP and approaches on how to have ACP discussions with health care surrogates of persons with
ADRD could improve staff self-efficacy as well as improve documentation of ACP discussions and hospice use.
The NIH NOSI (NOT-AG-21-049): Dementia Care Workforce for Those Living with Alzheimer's Disease-
Related Dementias calls for research to develop training for direct care workers to identify competencies that
improve organizational processes related to staffing and ADRD care outcomes. This is a five-year, NIH Stage 3
cluster randomized trial (CRT) among 30 ALs (k=30) and residents with ADRD (N=450) with a baseline, three,
and six months post-intervention follow-ups using Donabedian's structure process outcome model to examine
the effectiveness of the PCEAL-DCP on dementia quality-of-care outcomes including increased
documentation of ACP discussions (primary outcome) and rates of hospice admission (secondary
outcome at treatment sites). A secondary aim (NIH Stage 1b) will test in a sample of AL nurses, administrators,
and dementia care coordinators (N=72) from the sample of 30 ALs with a baseline, one, three and six months if
the PCEAL-DCP improves staff self-efficacy and perceived organizational support, which in turn will
increase job satisfaction and job commitment at treatment sites. In exploratory Aim 3 (NIH Stage 1a) we will
evaluate the feasibility of collecting family satisfaction with care at the end-of-life outcome data from 60% of the
resident/family dyads sampled in Aim 1 (N=270) at both baseline and six-months to explore whether satisfaction
levels improve more in treatment compared to control sites. Dissemination of the PCEAL-DCP could be
implemented nationally and improve the quality of dementia care in ALs. Because we have manualized the
training and intervention, and it has already proven to be effective in a Stage 1b feasibility clinical trial and has
been approved through the Continuing Education program, the potential for widespread implementation of the
PCEAL-DCP appears to be high."
10885379,"SUMMARY
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is one of the two most common precursor lesions leading to
the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). IPMNs comprise a heterogeneous group of
tumors with a wide range of grades and histotypes, and the emergence of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) and multiplex digital spatial profiling have characterized unique cell populations, including dysplastic
epithelial and immune cells, within the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment that carry signature gene
expressions, which could be used as markers for disease progression. However, further studies are needed to
delineate the biological interaction between epithelial subtypes and immune cells that drive IPMN lesion
development. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for IPMN have been established using
oncogenic mutations and disruption of tumor suppressors found in human IPMN samples. Analyses of these
IPMN GEMMs have provided important mechanistic insight into the underlying progression of these
precancerous lesions to invasive PDA. Our group has developed a novel KNGC model (KRasG12D, nuclear
GSK-3β, PDX1-Cre) resulting in the development of IPMN through the retention of a ductal progenitor pool
defined by being AGR2+/AQP5+/DBA-, which are also detected in the IPMN KGC (KRasG12D, GNASR201C, Cre)
model and patient samples with IPMN. Additionally, KNGC animals show progressive desmoplasia beginning
as early as 4 weeks of age with increased immune cell infiltration, which we hypothesize is due to the high
expression of CX3CL1 (fractalkine), a chemokine involved in the recruitment of CX3CR1-expressing
monocytes, which are known to promote fibrosis in various disease models upon differentiation into type 2
macrophages. Indeed, our preliminary data from CX3CR1 heterozygous (CX3CR1GFP/+) and homozygous
(CX3CR1GFP/GFP) knockout in the KNGC model shows an enrichment of GFP signal in M2-like macrophages in
the IPMN lesions of the KNGCXGFP/+ model, whereas KNGCXGFP/GFP animals had a paucity of M2-like
macrophages, substantially reduced desmoplasia and impaired development of IPMN. It is our central
hypothesis that the ductal expression of CX3CL1 results in the accumulation of M2-like macrophages,
which facilitate the development and progression of IPMN in KNGC mice. We will address our hypothesis
through the following specific aims: (1) Determine the role of CX3CL1 in promoting IPMN development and
desmoplasia in KNGC mice, and (2) Determine the role of CX3CR1 in promoting immune suppressive
environment in KNGC mice. Altogether, this project will provide a mechanistic understanding of the CX3CL1-
CX3CR1 axis in the generation of an immune/stroma microenvironment facilitating IPMN development. The
information obtained in pursuit of the aims might lead to the identification of novel biomarkers that could be
used to monitor or treat patients with IPMN."
10897811,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Irritability, defined as lowered threshold for anger when experiencing the RDoC construct frustrative non-reward,
i.e., failing to receive expected rewards, is one of the most common reasons for pediatric psychiatric evaluation.
Our work shows that early detection is critical: If irritability in preschool-age (3-6 years, before 1st grade) continues
into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such
persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural
mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of
the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater
frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better
inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward
processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural
circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks
undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify
reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood
irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories
of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related
brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside
assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child
(cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting,
stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young
children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to
those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural
function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and
inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood
reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the
moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior
associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience.
Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time
point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for
precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people
(children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen)."

into school-age (after 1st grade), as it does for approximately 50% of preschool-age irritable children, such
persistent irritability puts children on the path to mental disorder across the lifespan. Thus, identifying the neural
mechanisms by which children persist vs. remit in irritability is paramount to intervene in the earliest phase of
the clinical cascade. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater
frustration when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better
inhibitory control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward
processing and inhibition in irritability trajectories is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural
circuitry during this developmental period is important because the reward- and inhibition-related neural networks
undergo substantial change and may be most malleable to early intervention. Our overall goal is to identify
reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize persistence vs. remission of early childhood
irritability. To this end, the proposed project will longitudinally characterize the neural and symptom trajectories
of preschool-age children into school-age. We will collect measures of reward- and inhibitory control-related
brain function at baseline and 24-month follow-up from 215 5-6-year-old children prior to 1st grade, alongside
assessments of child irritability and inhibition at each 6-month follow-up. A comprehensive assessment of child
(cognition, temperament, psychopathology), parent (psychopathology) and contextual factors (e.g., parenting,
stressors) will also be assessed at baseline and 24-month assessments. Our central hypothesis is that young
children with reward- and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to persist in irritability compared to
those who remit. Specific aims are to identify (1) concurrent contributions of reward- and inhibition-related neural
function to irritability at each age (preschool-age, school-age); (2) developmental changes in reward- and
inhibition-related neural mechanisms of irritability trajectories from early to middle childhood; (3) early childhood
reward- and inhibition-related neural predictors of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology; and (4) the
moderating role of child sex, parent psychopathology, parenting, and life stress on these brain-behavior
associations. This proposal will advance the field by revealing the neural circuitry of irritability risk and resilience.
Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (5-6 years) to prevent later disorders, multiple time
point imaging, and machine learning methodology. Our project is significant because it will pave the way for
precision medicine for irritability: providing the right treatment (based on neural mechanisms) to the right people
(children who will persist in irritability), at the right time (preschool age, before irritability problems worsen)."

Pulse oximeters are essential for physicians’ diagnosis and monitoring of respiratory anomalies in patients.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, their importance has grown because pulse-oximeter measurements of
hypoxemia have become the major indication for hospitalizing patients. Clinical studies have shown that
commercially available pulse oximeter measurements (SpO2) systematically overestimate true arterial oxygen
saturation measurements (SaO2) for persons with dark skin pigmentation at low concentrations of O2 in the blood.
This bias results in respiratory compromised persons with dark skin not meeting criteria for hospitalization or
initiation of ventilator support, thereby putting specific populations (Black, Latinx, and Native American) at
disproportionately greater risk for higher mortality or morbidity than those with light skin. No published
explanations exist for this well-documented observation and, indeed, the available literature often contrarily
states that pulse oximeter measurements are not affected by skin pigmentation. Our theoretical analysis and
pilot research, however, demonstrate that the bias is due to present-day devices’ use of red light-emitting diode
light sources, whose broad spectral bandwidth interacts with the spectral absorption of melanin concentration in
skin to systematically shift the devices’ calibration. This shift causes artificially high values of SpO2 at low blood
concentrations of O2 for patients with dark skin. The 3 proposed aims will extend our efforts to date, providing a
scientific foundation for eliminating this bias and to foster development and promotion of simple, inexpensive,
and bias-free pulse oximeters. In Aim 1, we will: (a) determine if there are other spectrally-dependent constituents
in the finger that change with each pulse; (b) determine how light-source bandwidth interacts with melanin,
including whether there are other pulse-dependent changes in spectral transmission through the fingers, and
how sensitive SpO2 measurements are to light source bandwidth; (c) specify the practical peak wavelength and
spectral bandwidth needed for bias-free pulse oximetry; and (d) fabricate an optimized light source that provides
bias-free pulse oximeter measurements for testing in Aim 2. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate that the finger probe
developed in Aim 1d provides bias-free pulse oximeter measurements (SpO2) that do not overestimate true
arterial oxygen saturation measurements (SaO2) for persons with dark skin pigmentation at low blood
concentrations of O2. In Aim 3, which will not employ human subjects as in Aims 1 and 2, we will translate our
findings (i.e., print, in-person, and social media) to physicians, hospitals, and health care facilities commonly
serving underrepresented minority populations. As part of Aim 3, in collaboration with a Stakeholder Board
convened by the Institute for Health Equity Research, we will target the medical and affected communities to
mitigate the impact of current devices through educational outreach and introduce them to bias-free pulse
oximeters once they are available. Finally, we will license the technology to major manufacturers of pulse
oximeters, giving preference to those who supply hospitals and clinics serving disadvantaged populations."

Texas Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards Maintenance and Preventive Controls
Initiative
The Office of the Texas State Chemist (OTSC) is the designated state agency that oversees the
regulation of animal feed including sample analysis. Specifically, OTSC is comprised of the Texas
Feed and Fertilizer Control Service (FFCS) which is the regulatory agency and the Agricultural
Analytical Service (AAS) which analyzes regulatory samples for FFCS and the Food and Drug
Administration. During the past 5 years, OTSC has fully implemented the eleven standards,
achieved ISO 17025:2017 accreditation, created a document management system and is utilizing
the system for AFRPS implementation. During the next 5 years, OTSC will more fully integrate
AFRPS through a number of activities including exploring how the PCAF regulations could be
incorporated into Texas Commercial Feed Rules, building a more robust facility risk ranking matrix
and analysis platform, expanding audits to focus on PCAF and CGMP inspections, utilize feed-
related illnesses or death data in the risk ranking matrix, continue to evaluate industry compliance
through the enforcement matrix, expand outreach content and audience and incorporate
Laboratory Flexible Funding Model program samples into the OTSC annual plan of work. OTSC
will expand the number of qualified field investigators who can perform PCAF inspections by
seven who will be supported by a Preventive Control Qualified Field Inspection Trainer and
Auditor. An expanded educational outreach program will include development of new content
including probability charts for hazards by feed type identified in the FDA Guidance #245, model
plans, and annual updates of the status of the Texas feed industry involving risks associated with
these hazards. Two new courses will be developed and delivered in a face-to-face and online
format to the Texas feed industry and beyond and are titled: Food Safety Plan Development and
Verification and the second titled Auditing a Food Safety System. These courses will include the
new content listed above and class room exercises enabling participants to complete or revise
their food safety plan, verify its ability to manage risk including verification of control measures
including prerequisite programs and preventive controls. OTSC field investigators, equipped with
this new information, will practice educating while regulating during non-FDA inspections of
commercial feed facilities. These activities will be entered into a feedback loop to continually
improve the training based on new information and participant feedback."

Having Alzheimer's disease or a related dementia, being ambulatory, and awakening in the night constitute a
recipe for a dangerous fall. Add a lighting system that promotes postural stability, and the fall may be avoided.
That is exactly what our recent NIH R21 exploratory/developmental randomized crossover trial did, and exactly
what we found -- a 34% decrease in falls due to a novel lighting intervention. The proposed project will build on
that preliminary effort; if the results are as promising as suggested, this pragmatic passive lighting system has
the potential to reduce falls and related sequelae for countless persons with Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias, and to become a new standard of care.
Falls are the primary cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries among persons 65 years of age and older. Dementia
is a major risk factors for falls, and assisted living (AL) communities are the primary provider of residential care
for ambulatory older adults with dementia, making AL a critical setting in which to reduce falls. Forty-two
percent of the more than 811,000 AL residents across the U.S. have moderate or severe dementia, 84% are
ambulatory, and more than a third experience a fall in a six-month period, putting them among the 15% of AL
residents who suffer a hip fracture or other serious fall-related injury each year. Falls are responsible for one-
third of all hospitalizations of AL residents, and the resulting injuries may lead to a cascade of events, including
worsening function, nursing home transfer, and death.
A significant number of these falls occur in the bedroom during the evening and night, when AL staff are not
present, thereby limiting their ability to intervene. However, the cause of many of these falls -- impaired
nighttime vision and related postural instability -- suggests a promising avenue for intervention. Specifically, an
intervention that does not require staff effort, and that targets orientation and postural stability in the evening
and night when lighting is poor and residents may not be fully awake, has great potential to reduce falls in AL.
This project will test the effectiveness of a novel intervention consisting of unobtrusive, low-intensity, horizontal
and vertical lights that outline the bathroom or entry way doorframe in residents' rooms and provide visual cues
to promote postural stability. The lighting system is particularly attractive and pragmatic because it is low cost,
requires no staff involvement, and can be easily installed in new buildings or retrofitted to existing buildings.
Specifically, this pragmatic crossover trial will enroll 390 AL residents with dementia and follow them for one
year, comparing the incidence of nighttime falls during the lighting condition to the incidence of falls during the
control condition; secondarily, it will determine whether and to what extent the intervention effect is modified by
resident- and environmental-level risk factors, and satisfaction with the lighting system. We expect that the
lighting system holds great promise to constitute a new standard of dementia care and falls reduction,
appropriate for use in all settings in which persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias reside."

The long-term goal of this project is to develop effective, precision therapies directed against the
initiating mutations of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). During the current funding period, we performed a
series of genomic and epigenomic studies that have clarified the mechanisms that AML initiating mutations use
to ""reprogram"" hematopoietic stem progenitor cells (HSPCs), increasing their fitness for transformation. In the
next funding period, we will use primary human AML samples, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs),
and genetically engineered mouse models to further evaluate the molecular mechanisms involved in
preleukemic reprogramming, and progression to AML. Four well characterized events (that initiate more
than half of AML cases) will be studied in detail. We will continue our work with DNMT3A mutations and PML-
RARA, and add the study of Core Binding Factor AML fusions (RUNX1-RUNX1T1 and CBFB-MYH11). The
""toolkit"" for these studies will involve the analysis of preleukemic and fully transformed hematopoietic cells from
these models, using bulk DNA and RNA sequencing, whole genome bisulfite sequencing, ATAC-seq, ChIP-
seq and/or CUT&RUN to detect the genomic locations of activating and repressive histone marks (and the
fusions themselves), and single cell technologies for RNA, DNA, and ATAC-seq. We will also be performing
comprehensive proteomic studies to complete ""proteogenomic"" datasets for these initiating events,
including 1) the identification of the hematopoietic proteins that interact with the initiating proteins
listed above, and 2) the development of quantitative deep-scale proteomic and phosphoproteomic
datasets broadly representative of all AML subtypes. The integrative analysis of these datasets (and their
availability to the AML community) should provide important new insights about AML pathogenesis, and
suggest mechanistically targeted therapies. In this proposal, we provide one representative example of this
process: using novel methods to identify proteins that interact with DNMT3A, we discovered several mutations
that disrupt the normal interaction of DNMT3A with an inactive isoform of DNMT3B (DNMT3B3); these
mutations destabilize DNMT3A and decrease its activity. Remarkably, we found that we can restore the activity
of many mutant DNMT3A proteins by retrovirally overexpressing DNMT3L, a protein that normally interacts
with DNMT3A and 3B in embryonic cells to increase their activity. ""Addback"" of DNMT3L into hematopoietic
cells with the Dnmt3aR878H mutation remethylates DNA, and decreases the growth of AML cells initiated by this
mutation. Since DNMT3L is epigenetically silenced in nearly all AMLs, a program to identify drugs and genetic
strategies to reactivate DNMT3L in AML cells will be developed. We have already found that Romidepsin, an
HDAC1 inhibitor, potently induces DNMT3L expression, and a clinical trial designed to evaluate the activity of
this drug in DNMT3A mutant AMLs is planned. Additional approaches for developing mechanistically driven
therapies designed to thwart initiating mutations will be developed during the next funding period."
10897828,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a life-threatening disease with unmet medical need (1, 2). Extensive
basic, translational, and clinical research has provided strong evidence of impaired mitochondrial function in
PAH animals and patients (3-8). However, whether mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) plays a causative role or just
co-occurs in PAH remains unclear. Our research showed that MD induced by chronic inhibition of mitochondrial
electron transport chain (ETC) pharmacologically (9) or genetically (10) is sufficient to initiate PAH in otherwise
healthy rats. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that connect MD with PAH pathobiology are unidentified, preventing
the development of novel therapeutic options. Our team developed a rat model that reproduces severe MD
described in patients with a G208C point mutation in the NFU1 protein. Insufficiency of NFU1, which assembles
and transfers Fe-S clusters to mitochondrial proteins, severely impairs the activity of ETC complexes, lipoic acid
synthase (LAS), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) (4). These changes in mitochondrial function induce PAH
in 70% of NFU1 mutation carriers (4, 11). The same mutation reproduced in rats resulted in a similar MD
phenotype and initiated spontaneous PAH (10).
The detailed characterization of this new animal model revealed that MD induces several pathogenic events,
such as impaired angiogenesis, activated proliferative signaling, and altered lipid metabolism. While these events
are known as direct contributors to the pathobiology of PAH, the causative role of MD in their initiation has never
been defined. We found that NFU1 insufficiency with a subsequent loss of lipoic acid biosynthesis and impaired
oxidative phosphorylation played a key role in these pathogenic events. In addition, we uncovered the protective
role of mitoNEET, an outer mitochondrial Fe-S cluster protein and a critical metabolic switch in the pathogenesis
of cancers and diabetes but never studied in PAH. According to our preliminary data, RV cardiomyocytes (CMs)
isolated from NFU1 mutant rats have inhibited mitochondrial function and altered lipid homeostasis, while chronic
administration of mitoNEET ligand abolishes RV lipotoxicity and reverses RV hypertrophy. Based on our
comprehensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that impaired Fe-S cluster assembly due to NFU1 insufficiency
manifests as severe MD with decreased function of LAS, PDH, respiratory Complex II and metabolic regulator
mitoNEET, and leads to dysfunctional pulmonary angiogenesis, pulmonary artery remodeling, and altered RV
lipid homeostasis. These changes mediate an increase in pulmonary pressure and RV hypertrophy/dysfunction.
Given that expression of NFU1 was found to be significantly reduced in the lungs of idiopathic PAH (IPAH)
patients, we propose that MD induced by NFU1 insufficiency is relevant to the broader etiology of PAH. Indeed,
we discovered a novel mechanism of metabolic-based downregulation of NFU1 expression by S-
adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding to mRNA, which could be responsible for NFU1 insufficiency in the absence
of its mutation."
10897830,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aberrant regulation of apoptosis is a hallmark of human pathologies, including neurodegeneration, autoimmunity,
and cancer. Intrinsic apoptosis is regulated by the BCL-2 family which is composed of anti-apoptotic proteins
(e.g., BCL-2 and MCL-1) which sequester pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g., BIM and BAD) or directly inhibit
pro-apoptotic effectors, BAX and BAK, preventing their oligomerization. Many cancer cells overexpress anti-
apoptotic proteins to promote aberrant survival. MCL-1 is unique among anti-apoptotic proteins because it is
essential in early embryonic development and for the survival of many cell lineages (e.g., hematopoietic stem
cells, lymphocytes, neutrophils, neurons, and cardiomyocytes). Our lab previously reported that MCL-1 has two
isoforms –– one that localizes to the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and one that localizes to the
mitochondrial matrix. Although OMM MCL-1’s canonical anti-apoptotic function has been well characterized, the
roles of matrix MCL-1 are still largely unknown. Evidence suggests that matrix MCL-1 serves to maintain normal
mitochondrial fission/fusion, oxidative phosphorylation, and cristae ultrastructure. The basis for these physiologic
roles of MCL-1 remains unknown. Metabolomic investigation of Mcl1–deficient (Mcl1–/–) murine embryonic
fibroblasts (MEFs) and MEFs lacking matrix-localized Mcl1 revealed that they are highly sensitive to glutamine
deprivation as compared to wild-type MEFs. Additionally, MCL-1 protein levels decrease after 24 hours of
glutamine withdrawal in wild-type MEFs. These data suggest a link between MCL-1 and glutamine metabolism
that could be connected to the mitochondrial defects that are observed upon Mcl1 deletion. The goal of this
proposal is to determine the functions of matrix MCL-1 and gain a mechanistic understanding of these functions.
I hypothesize that matrix-localized MCL-1 plays an essential, non-apoptotic role in maintaining
mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics. To address this hypothesis, I will use a novel mutant mouse
that endogenously expresses a truncated MCL-1 protein (MCL-1OM) which blocks apoptosis but cannot be
imported into the mitochondrial matrix. First, I will ectopically express Mcl1 mutants back into Mcl1–/– MEFs to
determine which version(s) of Mcl1 can rescue the death triggered by glutamine withdrawal. I will also perform
mRNA-Seq on Mcl1–/–, Mcl1+/+, Mcl1–/+, and Mcl1–/OM MEFs to interrogate the metabolic rewiring induced by loss
of matrix-localized MCL-1. Second, I will assess mitochondrial function (e.g., Seahorse XF Mito Stress Test and
TMRE staining), determine the proteins interacting with matrix-localized MCL-1, ectopically express Opa1 and
Drp1 mutants in Mcl1–/– MEFs, and perform confocal imaging on these cells to determine the functions of matrix-
localized MCL-1 in mitochondrial morphology. Finally, I will perform in vivo experiments on Mcl1-/OM mice to
analyze T cell activation, effector function, and memory T cell generation. These findings will provide new,
mechanistic insights into the non-apoptotic roles of matrix-localized MCL-1 and could shed light on the potential
consequences of using MCL-1 inhibitors for clinical applications."

As a pediatric surgeon at Texas Children’s Hospital, the nation’s largest children’s hospital and a central hub for
the treatment of Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR)—a disorder caused by defective enteric nervous system (ENS)
development, I strive not only to deliver excellent surgical care, but also to decipher the mechanisms behind
disease etiology. In my practice, I remove the abnormal, aganglionic intestine and pull-through “normal”
ganglionated intestine but continue to be perplexed by the nearly 50% incidence of postoperative bowel
dysfunction. Thus, my goal as an aspiring surgeon-scientist is to investigate the postnatal mechanisms that result
in these poor postoperative outcomes. The K08 program is an ideal foundation to develop the technical and
scientific skills I need to make translational impact for my patients. The present application lays out a five-year
educational and research plan focused on identifying drivers of persistent postoperative dysfunction in the
ganglionated HSCR colon microenvironment. Enteric neurons have long been recognized as mechanically
sensitive to extrinsic force (axial stretch and radial distention) and intrinsic mechanics (tissue stiffness), both of
which are present before and after HSCR surgery. It is not known how these forces affect ENS phenotype and
function, which raises the question of whether known mechanosensitive ion channels and/or focal adhesion
kinase (FAK) signaling could be pathophysiological mediators of ENS responses to tension. Consistent with our
logic, the ion channel Piezo1 and focal adhesion molecule FAK are ubiquitously present in the gastrointestinal
tract, but their role in ENS response to biomechanical forces requires further investigation. My data demonstrates
that HSCR intestine at baseline has a dysregulated ECM, which leads to changes in tissue stiffness, and that
extrinsic force further dysregulates the ECM. Still, it remains unclear how these changes in the ECM
microenvironment regulate the ENS. Therefore, we hypothesize that biomechanical forces on the intestine have
Piezo1-FAK dependent effects on the ENS and regulate ECM composition in a manner that governs the ENS
microenvironment, which ultimately contributes to gut dysfunction in HSCR. I will address this research question
in two aims, under the guidance of my mentor, Dr. Keswani, and expert scientific advisory committee. In Aim 1,
I will define the role of clinically relevant, extrinsic mechanical forces on the ENS in normal and HSCR intestine.
This will allow me to develop new technical expertise in live cell calcium imaging, ex vivo tissue culture, and in
vivo tension models to evaluate the signaling of Piezo1-FAK in ENS responses to extrinsic mechanical forces.
Aim 2 will focus on testing how biomechanical forces regulate the ECM to alter the ENS microenvironment in
HSCR, and whether changes in the ECM are indicative of post-surgical prognosis in HSCR. In this aim, I will
work with novel biomechanical and hydrogel models to investigate the interaction between the ENS and ECM,
and develop a novel risk prediction model using human HSCR tissue features. Completion of these aims will
launch my career as a surgeon-scientist with meaningful impact for the care for my patients."

Cytokinesis is essential for cell proliferation, cell differentiation, and tissue homeostasis. Most events and
proteins of cytokinesis are conserved from yeast to humans. Majority of the proteins involved in cytokinesis have
been identified, however, the mechanisms of actomyosin contractile-ring constriction, plasma-membrane
expansion in the cleavage furrow, and extracellular matrix remodeling are still poorly understood; nor do we
understand how cells coordinate these events for successful cell division. Here we propose to continue
elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cytokinesis using fission yeast as a model system. Previous studies
and our solid preliminary data led to the central hypothesis of this proposal that coordination between exocytosis
and endocytosis is essential for successful plasma membrane deposition and septum formation during
cytokinesis, and septins and Ync13 are among the crucial coordinators. We will use complementary genetic,
cellular, microscopic (confocal, TIRFM, electron microscopy, electron tomography, and super-resolution),
biochemical, structural, and computational approaches to test this hypothesis by investigating three specific aims:
1) Elucidate how septins define the sites of vesicle tethering by the exocyst and how they affect the sites of
endocytosis; 2) Characterize how Ync13 coordinates exocytosis and endocytosis during cytokinesis; 3)
Investigate molecular mechanisms of trafficking, anchoring, and regulation of glucan synthases during
cytokinesis. Our studies on the relationships between septins, the exocyst, Munc13/UNC-13 protein Ync13, F-
BAR protein Rga7, coiled-coil protein Rng10, and glucan synthases will provide molecular links among the main
cytokinesis events. Our proposed studies are significant because they will advance the understanding of
cytokinesis in three important ways: a) What are the roles of septins in exocytosis and endocytosis during
cytokinesis; b) how Ync13 coordinates exocytosis and endocytosis for successful cytokinesis; c) how septum
synthases are trafficked and regulated. The concepts learned from this project will be applicable to understand
the coordination of septins, the exocyst, plasma-membrane deposition, and extracellular matrix remodeling in
human cells because our three specific aims involve the most conserved aspects of cytokinesis. Because the
fungal specific essential enzymes such as glucan synthases, which build the septum during cytokinesis, are
targets of several antifungals, our studies on the regulators of these synthases proposed here may lead to novel
targets for antifungal drugs. Thus, our discoveries on both conserved and fungal-specific aspects of cytokinesis
may be harnessed to improve human health."

10895016,"Asthma is an inflammatory lung disease that affects >300 million people worldwide. Obesity/metabolic
dysfunction, which affect 40% of adults in the US, is associated with a more severe asthma endotype. Unlike
mild asthma which is driven by a Th2 immune response, the “obese asthma” endotype is associated with frequent
asthma exacerbations, a shift away from Th2-dominated inflammation towards a Th17-dominated profile, and a
marked female bias. A major gap in our understanding of mechanisms driving the “obese asthma” endotype is
due to deficiencies in common mouse models of obesity. Standard mouse models of high-fat diet (HFD) driven
obesity are unable to induce extensive weight gain and metabolic dysfunction in female mice - a major
shortcoming given the female bias of the “obese asthma“ endotype. Our group has uncovered that HFD feeding
of C57BL/6 mice housed at a temperature in which they are at metabolic homeostasis (thermoneutral
temperature (TN); 30-33°C) promotes severe obesity and metabolic dysfunction in female mice. Preliminary data
using this model demonstrate that allergen-challenged obese female mice exhibit: (1) worse asthma outcomes
compared to lean controls; (2) reduced markers of type 2 immunity (eosinophilia, Th2 cytokine production); and
(3) a selective increase in the IL-17A production by innate lymphocytes, particularly gd T cells and Mucosal
Associated Invariant T cells (MAIT cells). Critically, none of these changes are observed in obese asthmatic
male mice. Although both gd T cells and MAIT cells have been ascribed protective roles in the context of asthma
and metabolic homeostasis, in obesity their proinflammatory vigor increases, and they become important
mediators of glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and tissue inflammation invoking extreme functional
plasticity. Importantly, no studies have examined the role of these cells in obese asthma to date. Based on our
novel preliminary data, we hypothesize that, innate lymphoid populations (gd T cells, MAIT cells) acquire
pathogenic functions in obese female mice and contribute to the development of the “obese asthma”
endotype. This hypothesis will be tested in two aims. Aim 1: To determine if gd T cells or MAIT are necessary
and sufficient to trigger more severe asthma in obese female mice. Using gd T cell or MAIT cell blocking
agents, and adoptive transfer of purified gd T cell/MAIT populations from lean or obese asthmatic females to lean
asthmatic male and female mice, followed by assessment of asthma and metabolic endpoints, we will determine
the necessity and sufficiency of these cells in obese asthma. Aim 2: To compare the proinflammatory and
metabolic landscapes of innate lymphocytes from lean and obese asthmatic female mice. Transcriptional
landscape of purified lung innate lymphocyte populations (gd T cells, MAIT cells, ILCs, iNKT T cells) from lean
and obese asthmatic female mice will be analyzed. Changes in inflammatory and metabolic pathway gene
expression will be correlated to asthma and obesity-related sequelae severity. Notably, completion of these
studies will advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying “obese asthma” endotype."

Improving the quality of care for patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) continues to
be a national priority. Concurrently, hospital-physician vertical integration – namely, hospitals
acquiring independent physician practices, directly employing physicians, or having significant
financial ties to physician practices – has become commonplace. Prior research has largely
shown hospital-physician integration to be associated with higher healthcare costs with mixed
effects on quality and utilization outcomes. However, no known study has examined the effect of
hospital-physician vertical integration on outcomes for patients with MCCs, who tend to be
costly, high utilizers of health care. To address this gap and inform future policymaking, we will
examine the association between hospital-physician vertical integration and costs, quality, and
health services utilization for patients with MCCs. To meet the objectives, Aim 1 will evaluate
the association between hospital-physician vertical integration and health services utilization for
an insured panel of patients with MCCs, while Aims 2 and 3 will evaluate the effect of this type
of vertical integration on costs and quality, respectively. We will use data from four sources: 1)
the Virginia All-Payer Claims Database (VA APCD), a longitudinally linked state-level database
consisting of de-identified patient-level medical and pharmacy claims for millions of Virginia
residents with commercial, Medicaid, and/or Medicare coverage 2) the Medicare Data on
Provider Practice and Specialty (MD-PPAS) file, a data repository of specialties, practice

Improving the timeliness and quality of care for lung cancer (LC) and head and neck cancer (HNC) patients is of
utmost importance because delays in treatment initiation are associated with cancer recurrence, lower survival,
and poor patient outcomes (e.g., distress). Rural LC and HNC patients experience significant treatment delays.
Compared to urban patients, patients in rural areas face added challenges such as needing to travel long
distances to access care, having lower socio-economic status, and having less availability of cancer treatment.
The objective of this study is to improve the timeliness and quality of care for LC and HNC patients who are
underserved (e.g., low-income, underinsured) and from rural and frontier counties in the Rocky Mountain States,
treated by the University of Colorado Health System that serves patients from Colorado and Wyoming and the
Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth Health System that serves rural patients from Colorado, Utah, and Montana.
We will apply the CARES (Cancer Advocacy, Resources Education, and Support) intervention to target factors
specific to rural LC and HNC patients who are underserved and factors that due to their statistical and clinical
significance are associated with suboptimal initiation of treatment and poor quality of care for these patients. The
hallmark of the CARES intervention is implementing it at key points during LC and HNC treatment, likely
augmenting its effects on the outcomes more effectively and more efficiently than current usual care practices.
Using a randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) design, we will compare the CARES intervention effects to the
effects of usual care practice on the: (a) time to treatment initiation and (b) time to treatment completion. The
CARES intervention also targets (c) quality of care outcomes (e.g., patient communication, coordination of care,
providing information to patients) and (d) patient-reported outcomes (e.g., coping, distress, quality of life).
Approximately 440 LC and HNC patients will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention
(n=220) or to the usual care condition (n=220). We will employ intent-to-treat analyses with linear mixed models
(LMMs) to analyze the primary outcome of time to treatment initiation and the secondary outcomes. We predict
that those who receive the CARES intervention will improve in all study outcomes to a greater degree than those
who received usual care. Our ultimate goal is the dissemination and implementation of the CARES intervention
into rural clinical practice to improve the timeliness and quality of care for rural and underserved patients and
reduce disparities in LC and HNC morbidity and mortality. Thus, we will assess the pragmatic implementation
and scalability of the CARES intervention by evaluating the overall effectiveness of the intervention's strategies,
as well as ""how and why"" they work in real-world practice."

Adjuvants included as a component of a vaccine have a major impact on vaccine efficacy via modulating and
prolonging host immune responses. While vaccines are the most effective way to prevent and control infectious
diseases, many pathogens that significantly impact human health remain without an effective vaccine. For
example, one-fourth of the world’s population is latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the
causative agent of tuberculosis (TB)1, a leading infectious disease killer in the world. The currently licensed TB
vaccine, M. bovis BCG (BCG) provides variable protective efficacy (0-80%) across the world2-4. In the absence
of clear correlates of protection for TB vaccines, it is imperative that we explore new and effective approaches
to target broad T cell responses for vaccine-induced immunity against TB. In the current proposal, we
hypothesize that use of new adjuvants that drive Th1 responses (UM-1007, a novel TLR7/8 agonist) and Th17
responses (UM-1098, a novel Mincle agonist) will significantly augment vaccine-induced protection against TB.
Thus, during the R61 phase of the proposal, we will optimize the use of these novel Th1- and Th17-inducing
adjuvanted vaccine platforms and conduct proof-of-principle studies including detailed assessment of
immunogenicity, antigen optimization, identification of prime-boost strategies that enhance lung Th1- and Th17-
vaccine responses (Specific Aim 1), and test if these novel Th1- and Th17-inducing TB vaccine candidates will
protect in mouse challenge models of TB (Specific Aim 2). During the R33 phase we will test the optimized
Th1- and Th17-inducing TB candidate vaccines for immunogenicity, safety and protection in an aerosol challenge
model in macaques (Specific Aim 3). We also propose that we will meet the following milestones. R61 phase.
Milestone 1 (Month 12): Antigen selection for an optimized IM vaccine producing a Th1 response (UM-1007:TB)
and a Th17 response (UM-1098:TB). Milestone 2 (Month 18): Identification of the best prime-boost strategy for
a TB vaccine inducing maximal lung Th1 responses (UM-1007:TB) and Th17 responses (UM-1098:TB).
Milestone 3 (Month 33): Testing efficacy of optimized UM-1007:TB and UM-1098:TB candidates against drug
susceptible and drug resistant Mtb and in genetically diverse Mtb-infected mice. Milestone 4 (Month 36):
Submission of R33 transition package. R33 phase. Milestone 5 (Month 60): Immunogenicity, safety and efficacy
studies of optimized UM-1007:TB and UM-1098:TB vaccines in macaques and in-depth characterization of
vaccine-induced immune responses. Milestone 6 (Month 60): Final selection of newly discovered Mtb vaccine.
Thus, the work proposed in this grant will result in a novel, first-of-kind rationally designed Th1- and/or Th17-
inducing TB vaccine for use in humans in the near future."

The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in all aspects of cognition and behavior and has established roles in all
forms of mental illness and substance use disorders. The PFC has been studied intensely over the past four
decades. Interest in studies of the PFC in animal models has grown at a pace equal to that of human studies on
the PFC. There are very few meetings that focus on the PFC and bring together researchers using different
animal models (non-human primates, rats, mice) and a variety of experimental approaches (e.g., lesions,
pharmacology, anatomy, physiology, molecular tools, computational models). A new Gordon Research
Conference (GRC) on the Frontal Cortex was established in 2022 to provide a forum for researchers interested
in the PFC and related cortical areas (e.g., OFC). This meeting was highly successful at developing a strong
community of scientists interested in discussing topics across disciplines, models, and techniques. The next
GRC will convene in Holderness, NH in August 2024. It is our hope that financial support can be obtained from
the NIH to build upon our successes and support the meeting. Support from NIH will allow us to offset the
attendance costs of our invited speakers and trainees, especially early career investigators and attendees from
underrepresented groups. We propose the following Aims: (1) To convene a diverse scientist workforce around
fundamental questions in research on the frontal cortex. The conference will feature panels on development,
circuit function, therapeutics, affect, cognitive control, and more, in keeping with the goal of connecting diverse
fields. (2) To unite a diverse scientist workforce around emerging technologies in frontal cortex research. Panels
will discuss the use of powerful tools such as optogenetics/chemogenetics, calcium imaging, computational
analyses, and more, and how they can be used to link studies in mice and rats to findings from studies in humans
and non-human primates. (3) To promote the development of women scientists, early-career researchers, and
under-represented investigators in frontal cortex research. In the service of this goal, we will support participation
from trainees and members of underrepresented groups, including providing financial support for attendance,
and we will host a networking and mentoring PowerHourTM focused on Imposter Phenomenon, Microaggressions
and Stereotype Threat."

nationwide. Aortic aneurysms are the 16th leading cause of death in patients >35 years old in
the United States. Dissection and rupture of aTAAs are catastrophic cardiovascular
emergencies carrying significant pre-hospital (40%) and operative (17-25%) mortality. Surgical
guidelines rely on aTAA maximum diameter, growth rate, and symptoms to guide elective
repair, which can be performed with low operative mortality. However, we and others have
demonstrated that diameter alone is not adequate to predict dissection or rupture—~60-90% of
type A dissection events occur in aTAAs with diameter <5.5cm and otherwise not meeting
elective surgical repair indications. From a biomechanics perspective, rupture or dissection is a
mechanical failure that can occur when aneurysm wall stress exceeds wall strength. Guidelines
simply use diameter as a surrogate for wall stress based on LaPlace’s Law for cylinders. Our
published studies showed that diameter was a poor predictor of wall stress due to the
complexity of individual aTAA geometries.
We propose to prospectively evaluate changes in aTAA wall stresses and distensibility to
determine their ability to improve on diameter criterion to predict dissection or death or need for
surgery in veterans with aneurysms that do not meet criteria for surgery. We propose to
prospectively evaluate changes in aneurysm wall shear stresses, flow velocities, and vortices in
veterans with nonsurgical sized aTAAs over time to determine their ability to predict aneurysm
growth and need for surgery. This proposal lays the foundation for practical clinical application
of patient-specific biomechanics and fluid dynamics to improve risk prediction of aortic
dissection, sudden death, aTAA growth, and need for surgery with the following aims:
Aim 1: To determine changes in longitudinal wall stresses using finite element analysis (FEA) to
correlate with clinical composite endpoint of aortic dissection, need for surgical repair, or sudden
death in prospectively followed veterans (n=400) with nonsurgical aTAA <5.5cm over 4 years.
Aim 2: To determine changes in aTAA wall strength using the surrogate of in vivo aortic
distensibility to correlate with clinical composite endpoint of aortic dissection, aTAA surgical
repair, or sudden death in prospectively followed veterans (n=400) with nonsurgical aTAA
<5.5cm over 4 years.
Aim 3: To determine changes in aTAA circumferential wall stresses and wall shear stresses,
flow velocities, and eccentricity using fluid structure interaction (FSI), validate with 4D flow
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and correlate with clinical composite endpoint of aortic
growth or need for surgical repair in prospectively followed veterans (n=400) with nonsurgical
aTAA <5.5cm over 4 years.
Aim 4: To develop a machine learning (ML) approach to determine biomechanical and fluid
dynamic parameters in Aim 1-3 in prospectively followed veterans (n=320) with nonsurgical
aTAA <5.5cm, validate the results (n=80), and simplify the process of personalized
biomechanics prediction.
At the end of the project, we will have developed a new biomechanics based clinical tool for
effective clinical management for non-surgical aTAA patients."

Sepsis is a medical emergency defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host
response to infection. Septic shock is the most severe form, involving cardiovascular failure. More than
75,000 children in the US and four million children worldwide are hospitalized with sepsis or septic shock every
year. Sepsis is currently the most expensive hospital condition in the US and, for critically ill patients—
including children—is the most common cause of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and hospital death.1,26
The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called for
optimizing therapies for sepsis.33 Because fluid resuscitation provides the best established benefit for septic
shock (other than antibiotics), there has been an effort to identify the most effective fluid administration
strategy. Despite progress, a remaining key gap in knowledge delineated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign is
which crystalloid fluid is the most effective and safest to use for initial resuscitation of septic shock.
Two types of crystalloids are used for resuscitation in sepsis: 0.9% “normal” saline (NS) and balanced fluids
(BF). BF have well-established biologic and physiologic advantages over NS and two recent adult trials found
that BF reduced major adverse kidney events and mortality. However, in the absence of pediatric-specific
data, NS resuscitation remains the overwhelming preference among pediatric emergency clinicians. We
therefore propose the PRagMatic Pediatric Trial of Balanced versus NOrmaL Saline FlUid in Sepsis (PRoMPT
BOLUS) study, a randomized, open-label, pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial, to test the relative
effectiveness and safety of BF versus NS fluid resuscitation in children with suspected septic shock. Eighteen
pediatric emergency departments in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) will
collaborate with sites in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to enroll 8,800 children with suspected septic
shock. Eligible patients will be enrolled either through prospective informed consent or, after appropriate
ethical safeguards, “Exception From Informed Consent” for emergency research. Subjects will be randomized
to fluid resuscitation and maintenance fluids with either NS or BF for 24-48 hours, with all aspects of care other
than fluid type at the discretion of the care team. Our primary outcome is major adverse kidney events within
30 days from randomization (MAKE30), a patient-centered composite endpoint that includes persistent kidney
dysfunction, initiation of dialysis, or death. This outcome addresses the biological advantages of BF to
preserve renal blood flow and function compared to NS. Secondary outcomes include the individual
components of MAKE30, hospital-free days, length of stay, 90-day mortality, and specified safety events.
This pragmatic trial will provide the definitive evidence necessary for a “paradigm shift” to move
clinical practice from 0.9% saline to balanced fluid-based resuscitation in children with septic shock."
10895084,"Summary
Intermediate filament (IF) proteins are encoded by over 70 distinct genes, placing them among the largest
gene families in humans. Members of the IF protein family have diverse functions in virtually all cell types.
They serve as critical components of the cytoskeleton and nucleoskeleton and act as sensors, modulators, and
integrators of other key structural and regulatory proteins. Mutations in genes encoding IF proteins cause a
wide range of diseases, including skin diseases, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, premature aging
syndromes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Abnormal assemblies of IFs are hallmarks of and biomarkers for
cancer neurodegenerative disorders, and liver diseases. Given the diverse functions of IF proteins, their
interactions with other cellular components, and their disease relevance, close collaborations between basic
researchers and translational investigators spanning multiple disciplines are necessary to overcome current
challenges in the field. Bringing together such diverse scientists will provide new insights into the physiological
functions of IFs and foster the development of novel therapeutic approaches for IF-related diseases. Towards
this goal, this application requests funds to support the June 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and
Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on IFs to be held at Rey Don Jaime Grand Hotel, located just outside
Barcelona in Castelldefels, Spain. We have organized a stimulating program of scientific sessions in an
environment that is conducive to concentrated discussion and debate, as well as informal interactions and
networking. The speakers and other attendees will be established, mid-career, and early-career scientists as
well as students and trainees from diverse backgrounds representing multiple disciplines. Aim 1 is to provide
an interdisciplinary forum for the discussion of the best and most recent research on IFs, and their relationship
to cell physiology and disease. Aim 2 is to highlight novel scientific themes relevant to IF research, which will
be accomplished by including novel scientific sessions and inviting several speakers outside of the traditional
IF community to promote new ideas and approaches. Aim 3 is to promote formal and informal scientific
exchanges on IF biology between investigators across the whole career spectrum. Graduate students and
postdoctoral researchers will also be able to participate in the GRS immediately prior to the GRC. The GRS is
run solely by graduate students and postdoctoral scientists studying IFs. To enhance interactions, each day of
the GRC and GRS will provide numerous opportunities for informal exchanges among participants, including
shared meals, free afternoons, poster sessions, and evening social times. The broad long-term objectives of
the GRC and GRS are to grow the IF community and to provide forums for the exchange of ideas among
scientists at all career stages interested in IFs, a family of proteins that are understudied despite their
significant impact on major areas of public health."
10897068,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposure to early life stress (ELS) often is accompanied by adverse health outcomes earlier in adulthood and
with more severity such as in the case of Systemic Lupus Erythamateous (SLE), an autoimmune disease. The
risk for autoimmunity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases with ELS exposure and CVD is the
predominant cause for early mortality in SLE patients. This project addresses the gap in knowledge of why
coexistence with ELS is associated with higher prevalence and heart disease in SLE. In the case of SLE—
despite reports linking worsened disease activity in patients with ELS—there have been no studies in preclinical
rodent models of SLE in conjunction with ELS. Several investigations demonstrate that ELS is associated with
a pro-inflammatory phenotype and vascular dysfunction. In our mouse model of ELS, maternal separation with
early weaning (MSEW), we observed aortic endothelial dysfunction dependent on superoxide and increased
numbers of F4/80+ macrophages, an innate immune cell, in the adventitia of the aorta. In addition, vessel
dysfunction and aortic stiffness is exaggerated in MSEW mice subjected to pristane induction of SLE. We expect
impairment in vascular function is due to proinflammatory macrophage presence in MSEW animals. Preliminary
data shows mitochondrial dysfunction is present in MSEW mice indicating the superoxide impacting endothelial
dysfunction may be mitochondrial derived. Thus, our overall hypothesis states that ELS accentuates the
development and severity of aortic disease in a mouse model of SLE through mitochondrial-derived superoxide
production and activated pro-inflammatory macrophages. This project is designed with two specific aims. First,
we will determine if macrophages mediate development of aortic disease in ELS. We will use flow cytometry
and RNA sequencing to determine immune activation differences between MSEW and control mice. We then
will determine if absence of macrophages in vivo prevents MSEW vascular dysfunction compared to controls.
Second, studies will address if ELS mediates enhanced development of aortic disease in SLE through
mitochondrial superoxide production. The pristane-induced model of SLE will be used in conjunction with the
MSEW protocol to determine if oxidative stress, previously linked to SLE-mediated hypertension, is accelerated
by ELS. Experiments will examine markers for CVD in SLE using telemetry and vascular reactivity after ELS.
We will also measure CVD and disease after blocking mitochondrial superoxide by MitoTEMPOL. We expect to
see (i)elevated inflammatory macrophages that, when absent, reduce vascular dysfunction and (ii)a greater CVD
burden in MSEW SLE mice reduced by MitoTEMPOL treatment. This project is critical to begin to understand
the mechanistic relationship of ELS in SLE as well as crucial for studying immune driven diseases with CVD
complications. ELS is associated with adverse health outcomes in a variety of diseases. Advances in the ELS
field are essential to developing relevant and accessible intervention and prevention strategies for patients. Our
studies provide two potentially complementary pathways for ELS-driven CVD."

 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disorder affecting almost 14% of the general population, and
this disease has shown a relentless growth over the past 2 decades. Patients with CKD have higher rates of
hospitalization, greater mortality, shorter life expectancy, and their healthcare costs are up to 5 times more
expensive than non-CKD patients. Thus, treatments to slow, halt, or reverse the progression of CKD could have
a significant financial and clinical impact. Chronic renal vascular disease (RVD), often associated with renal
artery stenosis, can deteriorate renal function and lead to CKD and end-stage renal disease in up to 15% of
patients. Despite the availability of treatments for RVD including drugs and percutaneous transluminal renal
angioplasty, renal function does not improve or even deteriorates in over half of the patients undergoing these
treatments. Leflore Technologies has developed a biopolymer-stabilized form of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) with high renal binding. Leflore Technology’s overall strategy is to use the biopolymer-VEGF
fusion for therapeutic angiogenesis to restore renal microvasculature and improve renal function in RVD and/or
CKD. During the Phase I portion of this STTR, non-GLP efficacy and toxicity testing were conducted with the
biopolymer-fused VEGF. Using a swine model of renal artery stenosis – induced RVD, angioplasty and stenting
with or without therapeutic renal angiogenesis using our biopolymer-stabilized VEGF was tested in a preclinical
trial. In the treatment arm, renal function and renal vascular density were significantly improved, and histological
markers of renal injury were reduced, relative to angioplasty and stenting alone. We also performed a dose-
escalating toxicology study in rats, which demonstrated that the biopolymer-stabilized VEGF induced no
significant side-effects at doses up to 100 times the planned therapeutic dose. The proposed Phase II studies
will advance the lead agent through cGMP manufacturing; chemistry, manufacturing and controls testing; and
expanded preclinical IND-enabling GLP toxicology. The planned studies will also extend our prior efficacy
studies by testing in animals with progressively more severe renal disease, with longer follow-ups, and using
multiple rodent models of CKD caused by diabetes or hypertension as well as extended studies in our
translational swine model of CKD to expand the potential target market beyond RVD treated with stenting to
chronic kidney disease as a whole."
10897082,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A majority of older adolescents in the U.S. are chronically sleep deprived, getting 1- 2 h less sleep than
recommended. The circadian (~24-h) system shifts later (delay) with the progression of puberty; this shift
contributes to late sleep onsets in older adolescents. Early school start times force teenagers awake earlier
than their spontaneous wake time. Thus, the opportunity for sleep shortens. Many adolescents are also
waking for school at the “wrong” circadian time. Chronic circadian misalignment and sleep restriction are at
their peak during late adolescence, and are associated with morning daytime sleepiness, poor academic
performance, conduct problems, depressed mood, suicidal ideation, substance use, insulin resistance, and
obesity. Bright light exposure from light boxes can shift rhythms earlier (phase advance) to facilitate earlier
sleep onset, and reduce morning circadian misalignment and the associated risks. We constructed the first
phase response curves (PRCs) to bright light in older adolescents. To phase advance circadian rhythms, our
PRCs showed that the ideal time to begin light exposure was slightly before wake-up time and light should be
avoided around bedtime because this is when light produces maximum phase delay shifts. An unexpected
finding from our results, however, was a second advancing region in the afternoon (~6 to 9 h after habitual
wake-up time) suggesting that afternoon light may have more circadian phase advancing ability than
traditionally thought. The overall goal of this mechanistic study is to follow-up on our unexpected PRC findings
and test whether individually-timed afternoon light alone and in combination with morning bright light can shift
circadian rhythms earlier in older adolescents aged 14 to 17 years. Four groups will be compared in a
randomized parallel group design: afternoon bright light, morning bright light, morning + afternoon bright light,
and a dim room light control. Adolescents will complete a 2-week protocol. After a baseline week with a stable
sleep schedule, adolescents will live in our laboratory for 4 days. Sleep/dark and the time of bright light
exposure will gradually shift earlier. Bright light (~5000 lux) will be timed individually based on his/her stable
baseline sleep schedule. The first 3-h morning bright light exposure will begin 1 h before wake on the first
morning. The first 3-h afternoon bright light exposure will begin 6 h after wake. The morning + afternoon
exposures will begin at the same times, but each exposure will be 1.5 h so that a total of 3 h of bright light per
day will be given to each group except the dim light control group. Phase shifts of the circadian clocks marked
by the dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) is the main outcome. We hypothesize that afternoon bright light will
advance DLMO more than dim room light and afternoon bright light will work synergistically with morning bright
light to produce larger shifts than morning or afternoon bright light alone. If our hypotheses are supported,
these data will challenge the current understanding of how to use bright light to shift the circadian system
earlier."
10897083,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in women world-
wide. While targeted and immune therapies have improved patient outcomes, a significant fraction of
patients fail to respond to treatment and die of their disease. Most of these therapeutic failures are
due to extensive intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) driven by genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity of
cancer cells in combination with selection forces of the local and systemic environment, such as
immune cells.
 The focus of my laboratory is to understand breast tumor evolution using interdisciplinary
approaches and improve the clinical management of breast cancer patients based on this knowledge.
We have been at the forefront of studies analyzing tumors as a whole and emphasizing the
importance of both cancer cell and stromal heterogeneity in disease progression and therapeutic
resistance.
 In our recent work, we made advances in dissecting the clinical and functional relevance of ITH.
We analyzed cellular genetic ITH in HER2+ breast cancer in relation to therapeutic responses. We
identified epigenetic enzymes as regulators of transcriptional heterogeneity and linked this to
treatment resistance. We showed that polyclonal tumors drive polyclonal metastases by altering the
local and systemic immune environments and we described progressively suppressive immune milieu
during breast tumor progression.
Our proposed research will focus on three general areas:
1. Decipher the breast tumor ecosystem at the single cell level: we will assess ITH using genomic
and computational tools to identify key cellular and spatial features of disease progression. We will
focus on preinvasive to invasive transition and treatment-resistant tumors progressing to metastatic
disease.
2. Conduct functional studies to gain mechanistic insights underlying ITH: we will apply single cell
tracking and functional screens in experimental models to assess the impact of metabolic and
microenvironmental stressors on ITH, especially epigenetic heterogeneity.
3. Design and test novel therapeutic approaches for heterogeneous breast tumors: we will follow up
known and new targets and conduct large-scale screens to identify synthetic lethal interactions and
understand mechanisms of synergy.
 Our recent findings also highlight the importance of tumor-host interactions that go beyond the
tumor microenvironment. Even localized tumors have systemic effects and host factors (e.g., age,
obesity) have a significant impact on tumor evolution. Thus, we will incorporate these into each of our
focus areas and study tumors in the context of the patient. Our goal is that an improved
understanding of how ITH drives disease progression will lead to changes in clinical practice,
including the development of novel, more effective individualized combination treatment strategies."

Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and is responsible for a third of cancer deaths in the
US. Tobacco-induced diseases and mortality are not equally distributed. Racial, ethnic, gender and sexual
orientation minorities, as well as those living below the poverty line and with lower levels of education, have
disproportionately higher rates of tobacco use and higher rates of tobacco-induced cancers. Tobacco control
policies to date have not adequately addressed these inequities. The tobacco industry is the vector of tobacco-
induced disparities. Therefore, reducing the burden of tobacco-induced disparities requires understanding how
the industry targets minority communities and cultivates social, policy, and regulatory environments favorable
to tobacco use. This understanding is ever more important as the landscape of tobacco products is evolving
rapidly as tobacco companies expand their portfolio of products and reposition themselves as providers of
tobacco harm reduction. The number and diversity of tobacco and nicotine products is increasing to include
electronic cigarettes, electronic pod devices, heated tobacco products, and other nicotine vaporizers. Tobacco
and the electronic cigarette companies are also expanding into the cannabis business. The impact of this
expansion in exacerbating existing tobacco-related disparities is unknown. Policymakers face a new challenge
in promoting tobacco-related health equity: responding to tobacco industry opposition to regulation while
developing interventions appropriate for novel tobacco products, and increasingly, cannabis products sold by
the same companies. However, local policy innovations are being implemented. We will explore how
policymakers consider different policies in attempting to decrease health disparities. We will use industry
documents, key informant interviews, publicly available policy documents (e.g., public hearings), published
reports, and news media, to pursue three Specific Aims: 1)Analyze evolving tobacco industry strategies, in
collaboration with third parties and allied industries, to influence public health policies and tobacco product
regulations in ways that exacerbate health disparities; 2)Understand tobacco industry marketing strategies that
seek to normalize nicotine use (including in new tobacco and nicotine products) and communicate claims of
reduced risk, and how these target racial/ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups; and 3) Analyze
innovative local- and state-level tobacco and cannabis policies to understand how diffusion of these policies
and interaction between them can support the reduction of tobacco-related health disparities and promote
equity. This unique scientific contribution can inform future public health programmatic, policy, and regulatory
strategies addressing the evolving industry and products while focusing on health equity."
10867905,"Deposition of amyloid plaques is a major pathological hallmark in brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Excess
accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ), caused by increased Aβ production and impaired Aβ degradation, leads to
progressive brain degeneration in AD patients; hence reducing Aβ accumulation should be highly beneficial to
amyloid pathology in AD brain. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation of RNA is the most prevalent,
abundant and conserved internal modification in eukaryotic RNAs and it influences fundamental aspects of
RNA metabolism including degradation, translation, splicing, and nuclear export. While RNA m6A
dysregulation is implicated in the neurodegenerative diseases, the potential role of RNA m6A dysregulation in
Aβ metabolism (production and degradation) in AD has never been investigated. Our group reported that
neuronal METTL3-m6A reduction contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Both
methylation profiling and a sequence-based m6A modification site predictor identified multiple m6A sites in the
mRNAs of APP, its secretases and Aβ-degrading enzymes. Our preliminary results demonstrated that
METTL3 reduction led to significantly increased Aβ level likely through modulation of Aβ metabolism genes.
Based on these studies, we hypothesized that METTL3-mediated m6A reduction modulates gene
expressions in Aβ metabolism-related pathways and contributes to the amyloid pathology of AD. We
will determine the effect of METTL3 deficiency-mediated m6A reduction on mRNA metabolisms by affecting
the decay, translation, splicing and nuclear export in primary neurons. The successful completion of this study
will provide novel mechanistic insights into Aβ accumulation and amyloid pathology in AD. Identifying a
molecular target for Aβ metabolism will offer new venue for therapeutic intervention for AD."

The transition of care from acute-care hospital to skilled nursing facility (SNF) is a poorly coordinated process
that exposes some of our most vulnerable patients to a high risk of complications, emotional distress, and
hospital readmissions. Preventable, medication-related problems are a common result of this poorly coordinated
care and are a major driver of the adverse outcomes that patients experience following hospital discharge. The
standard discharge processes currently required by The Joint Commission include hospital staff completing a
paper-based discharge summary and medication reconciliation form. Despite this process, up to 75% of patients
admitted to SNFs have at least one medication discrepancy between the SNF admitting orders and the hospital
discharge plan. In 2014, a Washington State collaborative led by the University of Washington and including
stakeholders from over 50 SNFs and hospitals ─ the Improving Nursing Facility Outcomes using Real-Time
Metrics (INFORM) collaborative ─ was formed to address this and other SNF-related quality of care issues. To
reduce the likelihood of medication-related problems during care transitions, INFORM stakeholders developed
the Pharmacy Integrated Transitions (PIT) program, which improves the standard transition process by adding:
1) a structured, synchronous “warm-handoff” between clinical teams at the hospital and the SNF, incorporating
patients and their families or caregivers, by using commonly available teleconferencing; and 2) a coordinating
transitional pharmacist to reconcile, adjust, and monitor medications during and after discharge from the hospital.
To determine the effectiveness of the PIT program across a heterogenous healthcare delivery systems, we
propose a cluster randomized trial comparing the PIT program with The Joint Commission care transition process
for patients transitioning from four diverse hospitals within one health system to a network of 16 SNFs. This
system-level randomized controlled trial will test the effectiveness of the PIT program in reducing medication-
related problems (MRPs) and improving patient-, family-, and caregiver-reported measures of the quality of care
transition. This study aims to: 1) compare the effectiveness of the Pharmacy Integrated Transitions (PIT) program
and the Joint Commission transition process on MRPs, and 2) compare patient and caregiver-reported measures
of quality of communication and care coordination between the PIT program and the Joint Commission transition
process. This study addresses a critical evidence gap that impacts the care of millions of people and is primed
for broader national uptake, as most hospitals and SNFs already employ the necessary key personnel,
resources, and technology, requiring only redeployment and training."

Organic anion transporter 1 (OAT1/SLC22A6), discovered by us (NKT), is the prototypical kidney organic anion
(PAH) transporter responsible for the transport of many drugs (e.g., diuretics, antivirals, NSAIDs). Based on
our in vivo studies of the Oat1 knockout mouse during the last project period and in vitro studies by us and
others, OAT1 is now believed to be a central component of a proximal tubule sensing and elimination
mechanism for gut microbe products and uremic toxins. Furthermore, recent data from our lab in rodents, as
well as human studies by others, indicates that OAT1-dependent function is critical for residual kidney function
in CKD. However, what is truly remarkable from our metabolomics and transcriptomics studies is the degree to
which OAT1, which is almost exclusively expressed in the kidney, regulates systemic metabolism--beyond gut
microbe products and uremic toxins. For example, it regulates many signaling lipids, citric acid cycle
intermediates, bile acids, and vitamins/cofactors. Indeed, OAT1 may be the renal gene with the broadest
effects on systemic metabolism. Although CKD is a multi-factorial disease, one of these factors is the
metabolic consequence of the gradual loss of OAT1-dependent sensing and elimination as proximal tubule
function declines. Thus, we hypothesize that, in CKD, the normal functioning of OAT1-mediated protein-bound
metabolite sensing and signaling in the proximal tubule is severely disrupted--leading to major disruptions in
small molecule metabolism and signaling. This is because of the endogenous role of OAT1 as a central
component of a larger metabolic network involving gut microbe-derived metabolites, some of which participate
in uremic toxicity in severe kidney disease but which also impact tryptophan and lipid metabolism as well as
other metabolic processes. Using the latest approaches to integration of large omics datasets and a
particularly novel multi-scale metabolic reconstruction approach (combining Recon3D with a genome-scale
microbiome reconstruction), we will define the pathways in Oat1 KO mice under conditions in which: a) the gut
microbiome is present or depleted; and b) kidney function is compromised. At the end, we will have fully
analyzed combinations of Oat1 KO vs WT, healthy vs depleted gut microbiome, and sham operation vs 5/6
nephrectomy, as sampled in the serum, kidney, liver and feces. This will settle (in mice) the relative importance
of each altered state on levels of uremic toxins, on biochemical pathways, and on overall multi-scale metabolic
impact as determined by genome-scale metabolic reconstruction for each of the conditions. A portion of the
omics data has already been obtained (KO effect, partial gut microbe effect). This project will thus produce a
validated detailed map of OAT1-centered metabolism in normal physiology and in diseased states, possibly the
first of its kind for any multi-specific “drug” transporter (Nigam, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, 2015). The
studies could lead to design of strategies for improving the metabolic abnormalities in CKD by affecting OAT1
function or expression."

Candidate: Deborah Kaye, MD, MS is a urologic oncologist and junior health services researcher focused on
improving the outcomes for patients with cancer. Dr. Kaye’s long-term goal is to become an independent
surgeon-scientist with expertise in quantitative and qualitative research methods, an in- depth understanding of
provider decision-making and intervention and clinical trial design, in order to devise, evaluate and implement
effective health care policies to improve the lives of patients with cancer.
Research Context: Numerous systemic therapies have recently been approved for the treatment of advanced
prostate cancer, demonstrating modest improvements in median survival fromtwo to five months. Unfortunately,
little is known regarding which therapies, or combinations of therapies, are most effective. What is known,
however, is that each option differs significantly in route of administration, side effects, and price. Currently,
treatment for advanced prostate cancer varies significantly based on provider specialty and location, and patient
race and income. With sparse comparative effectiveness evidence, treatment recommendations rely heavily on
physician preference and experience, which likely contributes to differential patient outcomes and payment
disparities. Economic and non-economic drivers of provider decision-making remain a critical knowledge gap in
advanced prostate cancer. Moreover, few interventions exist to decrease the out-of-pocket payments, and
therefore potentially improve outcomes for patients with advance prostate cancer.
Specific Aims: 1) To determine the factors contributing to provider decision-making for initial choice of systemic
therapy for advanced prostate cancer. 2) To develop a cost-transparency intervention to decrease patient OoP
payments for advanced prostate cancertreatment. 3) To pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, usability and initial
signals of efficacy of a cost-transparency intervention.
Research Plan: Dr. Kaye will use qualitative research methods (focus groups, patient and provider interviews)
to determine the factors impacting provider decision-making and type of first-line systemic therapy received, and
use iterative intervention design to devise a cost-transparency intervention to lower patient out-of-pocket
payments and improve outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Finally, this proposal will test the
feasibility, acceptability, usability and initial signals of efficacy of the cost-transparency intervention with a two-
arm randomized pilot trial
Career Development Plan: In parallel with the outlined research plan and under the guidance of experienced
mentors, Dr. Kaye will develop expertise in: 1) provider decision-making; 2) qualitative research methods; 3)
intervention and clinical trial design."
10897031,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pancreatic cancer is a major health issue in the US, with only 7% of patients surviving beyond 5 years
and nearly all patients presenting with metastases. Identifying factors that increase metastasis may aid early
detection methods and discover therapeutically targetable pathways to help with the clinical management of this
disease. To this end, we have generated a mouse model to delete the Ctnnd1 gene (which codes for the protein
p120catenin or p120ctn), which is necessary for E-CADHERIN stability and whose deletion results in enhanced
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in the Pdx-cre; KrasG12D; p53f/f (KPC) pancreatic
cancer mouse model. We show that KPC-p120ctnKO mice have dramatically enhanced metastatic burden relative
to control littermates. An unbiased screen of tumor cells from these mice resulted in the identification of
misregulated calcium signaling through the secreted factor Parathyroid Hormone Like Hormone (PTHLH) as a
previously unappreciated contributor of EMT/metastasis. Importantly, Pthlh deletion in orthotopic transplantation
experiments showed significantly reduced tumor growth and metastasis, suggesting PTHLH as an oncogenic
and pro-metastatic factor. Furthermore, treatment with an anti-PTHLH monoclonal neutralizing antibody reduced
cell proliferation and migration, demonstrating a potential clinical benefit. Finally, we have generated a
preliminary cohort of KPC-PthlhKO mice that have increased survival relative to KPC controls and are currently
embarking on a preclinical trial with anti-PTHLH antibody in KPC mice, to determine if blocking PTHLH will
attenuate this disease. Thus, we hypothesize that PTHLH is a driver of pancreatic tumorigenesis and metastasis.
 This will be achieved through the following interrelated Specific Aims: Aims 1 and 2 are to define the
effect of Pthlh deletion or inhibition upon pancreatic epithelial cell identity and ultimately, metastatic colonization.
In the same context, we will explore the role that other regulators (Camk2b and Mcu) of calcium signaling (Aim
3) play in these processes and identify novel downstream signaling components involved in calcium-mediated
pancreatic cancer metastases. Finally, in Aim 4, we will determine the role of PTHLH in orchestrating the immune
microenvironment and co-treat with immunotherapy.
 The proposed training in this K99-R00 application outlines an integrated plan of mentored research and
career development activities, as well as a specific strategy for my pathway to an independent research career
in pancreatic cancer. This award will allow me to refine existing and gain additional skills with the guidance of
my research mentors, Drs. Stanger and Rustgi, as well as an interdisciplinary advisory committee. Taken
together, the scientific proposal and training/career development plans will provide a compelling foundation for
me to become eventually a successful independent NIH funded faculty member."

Our proposal focuses on the development of novel Mdm2-targeted proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs)
that efficiently degrade Mdm2 in p53 mutant and deficient cancer cells and are expected to target p53-
independent functions of Mdm2. Our lead compounds bind with high affinity, degrade Mdm2, kill cancer cells
that lack functional p53, and are efficacious in vivo. We have also demonstrated safety and tolerability in vivo,
synthetic tractability, metabolic stability, and suitable in vivo exposure in mouse pharmacokinetic studies for in
vivo efficacy evaluation. The tumor suppressor p53, a transcription factor, has an essential role in the prevention
of human cancer. In the absence of cellular stress, the p53 protein is maintained at low levels due to its binding
to Mdm2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. However, half of all human cancers have inactivated p53 by mutation or deletion.
To test if Mdm2 is required for the survival of cancer cells that lack p53 we inducibly deleted Mdm2 in primary
murine p53-null lymphoma and sarcoma cells. Mdm2 loss resulted in apoptosis in vitro and in vivo in p53-null
cancers, with significantly reduced tumor burden and increased survival benefit. We and others have reported
that Mdm2 has p53-independent functions by binding and regulating other proteins, such as the p53 family
member, p73, and Nbs1 in the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 DNA break repair complex. p73 has a homologous N-terminal
transactivation domain to p53 which binds in the same site on Mdm2. Additionally, unlike p53, p73 is rarely
inactivated in human cancers. Since Mdm2-p53 inhibitors are not responsive to tumors with inactivated p53, we
pursued a PROTAC approach and provide preliminary data to confirm their ability to kill p53 mutated or deficient
cancer cells. Our hypothesis is that the degradation of Mdm2 via Mdm2-targeted PROTACs will kill cancers with
mutant or deleted p53 by activating the p53-independent activities of Mdm2. We will test this hypothesis with two
Specific Aims. Aim 1 will focus on expanding the characterization of our lead Mdm2 targeting compounds and
evaluate these in in vivo xenograft models. Aim 2 will be lead optimization of two Mdm2 PROTACs that killed
p53 mutant and deleted cancers. The goal of these aims is to have a characterized, effective, and potent Mdm2
PROTAC for clinical evaluation for the treatment of p53-inactivated cancers."

We propose cooperative partnerships between California State University, Northridge
(CSUN) and five outstanding Ph.D.-granting institutions. The partnerships described in
this proposal are a model for establishing a program between a comprehensive
Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), CSUN, and several pre-eminent Research Extensive
universities (UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Santa Barbara, and Stanford
University). Students participating in this Bridges to the PhD program will have the
opportunity to choose a MA/MS concentration at CSUN among biology, psychology,
chemistry/biochemistry, physics, and dietetics and nutrition. Linkages between the
Ph.D.-granting institutions and CSUN will be established or enhanced through these
partnerships. Activities and interactions that will foster and strengthen these ties include
seminars at CSUN by faculty from the Ph.D.-granting institutions, visits of CSUN
students to the Ph.D.-granting institutions, and the opportunity for CSUN students to
collaborate on research projects at the partnership schools. CSUN students will
participate in a special workshop that focuses on scientific rigor and reproducibility of
results as well as responsible conduct of research. The proposed activities will further
enhance the preparation of the participating Bridges Trainees for entry into Ph.D.
programs, and ultimately to their earning a Ph.D. in a bio-medically relevant program at
the partner institutions or a comparable one. We anticipate that over the five-year
timeframe, 42 trainees will have participated in the program. Of these, 35 students will
have completed the program (95% to have graduated with a master’s degree), while
seven will still be in the program after the first cycle of funding. We expect 100% of
those who earn a master’s degree to apply to Ph.D. programs in a basic bio-medically
relevant field. Based on past success at CSUN, we expect 90% of the trainees to enter
a Ph.D. program in a bio-medically relevant field and to have a retention/completion rate
of 95%."

Cancer progression and relapse remain the reality of current cancer therapy. Our work is aimed at understanding
the root causes of this persistent problem. Since my lab’s inception we have probed the role of developmental

progression, and carried out preclinical work that has formed the basis of clinical trials testing new agents for
drug-resistant leukemias – leading to the recent approval of Glasdegib to treat aggressive leukemia – and
pancreatic cancer. The current work I describe shows that the paradigm we established for hematologic
malignancies is a remarkably general principle used repeatedly in the regulation of many deadly cancers
including pancreatic cancer. Our prior studies have collectively set the stage for new avenues of research we
will pursue over the course of the next few years. In particular we plan to: 1) Define how differentiated benign
lesions transition to aggressive undifferentiated malignancies and develop targeting strategies; 2) Understand
cancer heterogeneity and define intrinsic and micro-environmental mechanisms that support therapy resistant

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a life-threatening plasma cell malignancy. It is 2-3 times more common in blacks
compared with whites. MM has a prolonged clinically detectable premalignant phase called monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) that can be identified by detection of the secreted
monoclonal immunoglobulin (commonly referred to as a monoclonal protein). MM is a serious incurable
malignancy, and the best approach for treatment is to prevent end organ damage by early intervention. This is
best done by targeting patients with an intermediate asymptomatic stage referred to as smoldering multiple
myeloma (SMM) that resides between MGUS and MM. Over the last 5 years of this grant we have extensively
investigated the reasons why MM is more common in blacks compared with whites, demonstrated that first-
degree relatives of patients with MM have a high risk of having the precursor MGUS lesion, and identified
several biomarkers that predict risk of imminent progression in SMM. Our studies show that a principal reason
for high risk of MM in African Americans is that they have a high risk of the precursor MGUS condition, which
we also found is present at a much earlier in age in blacks compared with whites. More recently we made an
important discovery using DNA sequencing based ancestry analysis that 3 specific cytogenetic abnormalities in
MM account for most of the racial disparity. Our research has assumed greater urgency with recent findings
that early intervention (in high-risk SMM stage) can prevent end-organ damage and prolong overall survival.
The goals of this renewal are to further determine the mechanisms behind the racial disparity in incidence of
MM, to identify new biomarkers for high risk SMM needing therapy, and to develop a feasible screening
strategy to identify patients with SMM. In Aim 1 we will determine the age at onset of MGUS using sensitive,
mass spectrometry (MS)-based detection of monoclonal protein in >12,000 NHANES samples, and identify
new cytogenetic abnormalities that are associated with predisposition to MM in blacks. In Aim 2 we will identify
new biomarkers that are associated with high risk of progression from SMM to symptomatic MM, specifically
utilizing mass spectroscopic characterization of the monoclonal protein, measurement of circulating clonal
plasma cells, and by studying clonal diversity and immune profile. In Aim 3, we will institute and determine the
feasibility and impact of a screening approach for identification of SMM eligible for early intervention, by
targeting high risk populations, specifically African Americans, first-degree relatives, and persons with high
total protein levels. Our grant will have a major impact on the management of patients with SMM and MM,
especially African Americans and first-degree relatives or persons with MM."
10896959,"Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) causes paralysis below the level of damage, which results from neuron and
oligodendrocyte cell death, axonal loss, demyelination, and critically, the limited capacity of spinal cord
neurons to regenerate. In contrast to patients with contusion injuries, individuals with penetrating SCI do not
recover some function due to plasticity and are reliant on reconnection of spinal pathways, such as through
biomaterial bridge that support true axonal regeneration. Although spinal cord neurons have the innate
capacity to regenerate, they are limited by the environment, which contains an insufficient supply of factors to
promote regeneration, and an abundant supply of factors that inhibit regeneration. Our long-term goal is to
develop a combination therapy based on biomaterials that can 1) bridge, 2) modulate the injury
microenvironment, 3) drive axon growth through an inhibitory milieu enabling the promotion and direction of
axonal growth into, through, and re-entering spared host tissue to form functional connections with intact
circuitry below the injury. We have shown that the bridge architecture leads to integration with the host tissue,
reduces secondary injury, and prevents cyst formation. The channels of the bridge support robust axonal
ingrowth into and through the bridge for corticospinal tract (CST) axons and extend >2 mm down the cord by
10 weeks post-implantation. Bridge implantation enhances functional recovery by itself, and modification of the
bridge to express anti-inflammatory factors further enhances function recovery by decreasing the secondary
damage and initiating a regenerative program that consists of genes associated with neural development and
repair. This proposal builds on these results and focuses on regeneration at chronic time points by providing
anti-inflammatory factors acutely after a penetrating injury combined with a biomaterial bridge at a chronic time
points. We hypothesize that acute delivery of factors to reduce inflammation will minimize inhibitory molecules
and spare regeneration competent axons adjacent to the injury, and that combination of this approach with
delayed bridge implantation and pharmaceutical microtubule stabilization will drive directed axon regrowth
through the channels to re-enter the caudal parenchyma and synapse onto intact circuitry in chronic SCI.
Toward this goal, gene delivery will be used to modulate inflammation and reduce inhibitory molecule
expression during the acute stage of injury (Aim 1). Regeneration at chronic times is investigated using bridges
in combination with the microtubule stabilizer epothilone B (EpoB), which drives axon growth through the injury
to connect with intact circuitry (Aims 2). The combination of acute and chronic therapies is investigated in Aim
3. The bridge platform can support multiple aspects of the regenerative process, and the well-defined
components, which have been used in the clinic, may facilitate the ultimate translation to the clinic. These
studies provide critical information on how early injury interventions can impact regeneration at later times."

Choosing a transplant center with the best outcomes can be challenging for patients. Several studies suggest
that patients have a choice of centers, but that they are often unaware of how their options may differ. The PI,
as Medical Director of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR), provides comparative
information to the public about each solid organ transplant center in the United States. The risk adjusted
outcomes, shown in center report cards, account for the transplant recipient’s health-related characteristics,
donor characteristics and transplant related factors. Many transplant centers provide a print-out of this SRTR
report card to their candidates to comply with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rules. Unfortunately,
in their current format, the center report cards provide three risk-adjusted metrics: survival on the waiting list,
transplant rate, and 1-year post-transplant survival. Our randomized trial has shown that patients often do not
prioritize the metric that is the most important predictor of mortality after listing. Thus, the SRTR report cards
need to be revamped to instead focus on the entire continuum of care from the time of wait listing.
The proposal aims to enhance and evaluate a patient-centered website and printouts of the SRTR report cards
that will effectively communicate comparative information to transplant candidates about survival rate since
listing at different centers. The project will use Dr. Hibbard’s published, conceptual model and develop a new
report card in English and Spanish. Aim 1 will use focus groups to determine how the metric of survival rate
since listing will be presented to transplant candidates clearly in a patient-centered report card. Using this
information, Aim 2 will conduct usability sessions in English and Spanish to develop a patient-centered website
and printouts of the SRTR report card. The new report cards will allow patients to best use both analytic and
experiential modes of thinking to use the new metric for decision-making. Both the English and Spanish website
will include a video navigator and a virtual chat agent to help patients navigate the web-based report cards.
Lastly, Aim 3 will conduct randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in English and Spanish, separately, to evaluate the
effectiveness of the new patient-centered SRTR report card. These RCTs will enroll potential transplant
candidates prior to listing at a transplant center. This study is beyond the scope of the SRTR contract.
At the end of the project, we will help patients choose a transplant center by using the English and Spanish
versions of the new report cards that provide information about survival rate since listing. The new report cards
can improve a broad set of patient-centered outcomes such as effectively navigating the complexity of
transplant centers, improving satisfaction with the center selection process, and potentially reducing death on
the waiting list, — thereby, producing better outcomes in the long run."

The anterior lobe of the cerebellum has unique sensitivities in developmental and
degenerative disorders. How anterior and posterior compartments are differentiated
developmentally are not adequately understood. The classical mouse mutation meander
tail (mea) causes both the kinked tail for which it is named and a compartment-specific
disorganization of the anterior cerebellum. Three independent alleles have been reported.
Positional cloning efforts more than a decade ago identified a genomic interval but failed
to identify causal variants due to technical limitations. Data from that project and from
genome-scale mutagenesis projects highly suggest a recurrent regulatory mutation
involving one or more structural genes adjacent to the mapped location. This exploratory
proposal will identify mutations underlying the two extant mea alleles and test the
molecular sequelae of mea mutation on anterior compartment identity and development
using cutting-edge genomic tools. The mea locus has been studied for nearly 50 years,
but molecular identification eluded efforts with earlier technology. We will resolve this
genetic puzzle using de novo long read sequencing, layered onto previously unpublished
mapping data. We propose that mea mutations are regulatory in nature and affect
compartmentation or compartment-specific identity with respect in the anterior cerebellar
lobe. This predicts either discrete or graded changes in expression signatures within or
across compartments. We will test this family of hypotheses using single nucleus
sequencing of RNA and transposon-accessible chromatin sites from mutant and control
littermates in a highly congenic background. Together these aims will resolve a
longstanding mystery in the genetics of cerebellum development and point to plausible
mechanisms for pleiotropic effects on vertebral development."

 The overall aim of this project is to determine the contribution of the rostral region of the posterior hypothalamic
nucleus (rPH) in stress adaptation. More specifically, stress habituation is defined as a progressive reduction in
responses upon repeated exposures to the same (homotypic) stressor. Psychological or “emotional” stressors
elicit a range of behavioral, autonomic, and neuroendocrine responses that normally help organisms cope with
perceived or actual threatening situations. However, prolonged, unabated and chronic stress exposure is
frequently associated with the development, precipitation, or exacerbation of several psychopathologies and
physical disorders. The sustained activation of stress responsive systems can negatively affect physiologic
functions and ultimately, survival. Thus, the reduction or inhibition of stress-elicited responses afforded by
habituation is likely a vital mechanism serving to reduce the cumulative impact of the same stressors experienced
repeatedly. Importantly, impaired habituation has been reported in several human clinical populations including
anxiety and mood disorders. Unfortunately, the neural mechanisms responsible for stress habituation are still ill-
defined, which makes it currently impossible to evaluate the contribution of habituation in psychopathologies.
 In this application, robust habituated neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses will be obtained
to repeated homotypic stress paradigms that will test the response specificity and generality of the proposed
brain manipulations. Based on detailed anatomical and functional results from our laboratory, emphasis will be
placed on the role of the rPH in the acquisition of stress habituation. Anatomically, the rPH is located at a focal
intersection between several sensory, limbic forebrain, and effector response systems activated by various
stressors, placing it in a unique position to undergo habituation-related plasticity that can regulate coordinated
responses to stress. The first aim is therefore directed at evaluating the novel hypothesis that the rPH region,
and some of its specific cell populations, contribute to the acquisition of stress habituation. Aim 2 seeks to
evaluate the possibility that intrinsic rPH neural activity is modified by repeated homotypic stress. Throughout
these aims, both female and male rats will be evaluated for putative rPH-related differences in stress adaptation
due to the differential prevalence of gender to anxiety and mood disorders and the widely reported sex
differences in habituation to stress. The proposed anatomical, functional and behavioral analyses of the rPH in
stress adaptation through habituation is novel and will provide converging evidence implicating this brain region
in stress adaptation and its sequelae."

It is well documented that a diverse workforce has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, which
have strong effects in aging populations1-3. As the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S.
population increases, including among the aged population, the public health workforce should reflect this
diversity1,4,5. With an increase in undergraduate public health majors across the country6,7, due in part to
heightened excitement and opportunities in data science and quantitative big data analysis, and with
breakthroughs in the science of aging on the horizon, this is an opportune moment to develop strong pipeline
programs for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates. We will target URM undergraduates who
have quantitative and computational interests and expose them to opportunities for graduate study and
research careers, and the possibilities and excitement of marrying their quantitative interests with substantive
research in aging. Introducing undergraduates, who are more diverse in public health majors than other
majors7, and than graduate students6, to careers in public health, holds much promise for increasing the
diversity of graduate students and faculty in the field, which has increased very little in the past 20 years6. This
holds for the MSTEM subfields of public health, such as Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Data Science, as well.
Motivated by these factors, and in response to NIA Funding Opportunity (PAR-17-290), “MSTEM: Advancing
Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education (R25),” we propose an intensive, six-week
summer program for 12 undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds with interests in Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, Data Science and other quantitative methods to learn about the applications of these methods
in aging research. The summer program includes formal instruction, a broad lecture series, mentored research
projects, oral research presentation at an annual symposium, career and professional development sessions,
site visits to labs and other research settings, group and informal mentoring, social activities and network
building, and training in responsible conduct of research. To reinforce the intensive summer experience, we
will continue to offer group and individual mentoring and research experiences into the following academic
years. Additionally, we will offer a select group of summer program participants the opportunity to return to
NYU during the January term for an extended research experience and a quantitative course. With the
guidance of a professional evaluator and internal and external advisory committees, we will evaluate all
aspects of our program and review results in real-time to enable constant adjustment and improvement.
Our proposal addresses three critical needs to strengthen and galvanize the research enterprise in the field of
aging: increased engagement of MSTEM experts, increased engagement of URM researchers, and increased
attention to disparities. We believe that our intensive and long-term programmatic components will support the
entry of talented URM students into successful careers in MSTEM research in aging."
10891456,"SUMMARY. Bone loss is accelerated in menopausal women, and more generally in both men and women with
aging. Current anti-resorptive and osteoanabolic therapies are generally prescribed only after pronounced bone
loss, and all can have adverse clinical effects. Dual-acting agents that are both osteoanabolic and anti-resorptive
may offer novel approaches to increase bone mass. The Pyk2 tyrosine kinase is dual-acting, both decreasing
osteoblast (OB) activity and increasing osteoclast (OC) resorption. Despite a similar increase in cortical
microarchitecture in male and female Pyk2-/- mice, only females exhibit increased cancellous bone mass and
mechanical properties, suggesting sex-specific differences in tissue level properties. In preliminary studies, we
found that ovariectomized Pyk2-/- female mice supplemented with 17β-estradiol (E2) have additively higher bone
mass than WT, and that ulnar loaded Pyk2-/- males (females not tested) exhibit higher bone formation rate,
suggesting enhanced osteogenic responses in vivo. Pyk2-/- OBs have enhanced mineralizing activity in vitro,
which is further stimulated by 17β-estradiol (E2) and raloxifene, a clinically-approved selective estrogen receptor
modulator (SERM). Pyk2-/- OBs exhibit reduced levels of estrogen receptor, ERα, due to its ubiquitin-proteasome
degradation, and we found that ERβ antagonists prevent the E2-stimulated increase in Pyk2-/- OB activity,
suggesting an increase in E2-ERβ signaling. On the other hand, Pyk2-/- OCs exhibit defective OC resorption
activity, and in the presence of E2, OC formation and survival are reduced compared to WT OCs. Our Specific
Aims will test the hypothesis that Pyk2 acts via distinct E2-ERα/ERβ-regulated mechanisms to exert dual-
modulating effects that repress OB activity and promote OC resorption. In Aim 1, we will demonstrate the role
of Pyk2 in the anabolic versus catabolic arms of the bone remodeling cycle by examining 4-, 12- and 21-month
mice in which Pyk2-deletion is targeted to either OBs with collagen type 1a, 2.3-Cre (Pyk2Col2.3) or mature OCs
with cathepsin K-Cre (Pyk2CatK). In addition, Pyk2Col2.3 mice will be subject to tibial anabolic loading, while Pyk2CatK
mice will be examined after hindlimb unloading-induced bone loss. In Aim 2, we will determine if bone mass is
preserved after sex steroid depletion (gonadectomy) of 4-month male/female Pyk2Col2.3 mice (due to elevated
osteogenesis) and Pyk2CatK mice (due to reduced resorption), and if E2 or raloxifene will additively improve bone
mass. We will dissect the Pyk2 mechanisms that regulate ERα degradation/stability, and effects on ERα/ERβ
dimerization, and E2-ERβ signaling in OBs and OBs in vitro. In Aim 3, we will establish the non-inferiority of a
Pyk2-selective inhibitor in preventing/reversing age-associated decline of bone mass and mechanical properties
in 12-month C57BL/6 female mice, compared to a broad-acting inhibitor of focal adhesion kinases, and
raloxifene. Clinical translational impact will be demonstrated using OBs and OCs prepared from male/female
human donors in vitro. Together, these studies will investigate Pyk2 inhibition as a dual, osteoanabolic and anti-
resorptive approach to reverse bone loss and improve bone quality/strength in osteoporosis and aging."

Social risk factors, or adverse conditions in which people are born, grow, live, and age1, contribute to greater
mental health problems2,3 and lower treatment engagement worldwide.4–7 The prevalence and impact of social
risk factors (SRFs) are particularly pronounced in low-to-middle income countries, where too few individuals—
and particularly children—with mental health needs receive care. To our knowledge, in global mental health
research, we have not systematically developed and evaluated strategies to address SRFs alongside mental
health treatments. This study builds on an NIMH-funded trial in Kenya, “Building and Sustaining Interventions
for Children (BASIC): Task-Shifting Mental Health Care in Low-Resource Settings” (R01MH112633). The
study goal is to develop strategies to address and mitigate SRFs alongside evidence-based psychotherapies
(EBPs) using decolonizing methodologies.8 Lay counselors and guardians involved in the BASIC study report
that children enrolled in the culturally-adapted EBP (Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy)9
experienced high rates of SRFs (food insecurity, lack of support system), with strong calls for improving
outcomes by addressing SRFs in therapy.10–12 Thus, this project responds directly to community needs and
addresses a documented challenge to the effective implementation of EBPs given the negative effect of SRFs
on mental health trajectory and treatment engagement. The study aims to: 1) Examine the experience of
SRFs and the barriers and facilitators to addressing SRFs in therapy through qualitative interviews with
PT counselors and guardians who received therapy in BASIC. 2) Collaboratively design impactful and
practical strategies to address SRFs in therapy during a 2-day workshop with supervisors and counselors.
3) Investigate whether a 2-day training in the developed strategies
and post-training supervision
impact
counselor-level outcomes (e.g., perceived self-efficacy/self-control, effectiveness, feasibility, and
acceptability of the SRF strategies). As many scholars have highlighted problematic influences of coloniality in
current and past global research,13,14 the study team will actively work against colonial attitudes by privileging
the voice of community stakeholders during all research activities and decision-making throughout the study.
Strategies developed through this project have the potential to improve engagement in and effectiveness of the
EBP in BASIC and ideally will be generalizable to other EBPs globally. Our ultimate goal is to improve
outcomes for individuals with mental health needs in low-to-middle income countries."

 Osteoarthritis (OA) is a classic age-related disorder and the most common cause ofpain and disability in
the
elderly.
It is primarily characterized by the progressive destruction of articular cartilage. This past decade
has witnessed significant advances in deciphering the basic mechanisms by which OA develops. However, to
date, no disease modifying drug therapy is available for preventing OA development and repairing the
degenerative cartilage. The uppermost superficial zone of articular cartilage is the first line of defense against
OA initiation. We recently found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a tyrosine kinase receptor, is
expressed abundantly throughout the articular cartilage with its active form (p-EGFR) predominantly located in
the superficial zone. Interestingly, at the onset of OA, p-EGFR amount, along with two major EGFR ligands
(TGFα and HBEGF), were markedly attenuated while the amount of Mig6, a negative inhibitor of EGFR, was
enhanced, suggesting a potential role for EGFR signaling pathway in cartilage homeostasis and diseases.
Using a series of mouse models with deficient or overactivated EGFR activity by genetic manipulation of Egfr
and Mig6 genes, we and others have demonstrated that EGFR signaling is critical for maintaining the number
and mechanical properties of superficial chondrocytes, suppressing their hypertrophy, promoting proteoglycan
4 (Prg4) expression, and stimulating surface lubrication function. Most strikingly, in aging- and surgery-induced
OA models, mice with chondrocyte-specific (Col2-Cre) EGFR deficiency developed the most severe OA
phenotypes, including a complete loss of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis, and escalated joint
pain. Hence, we hypothesize that EGFR signaling is essential for maintaining the structure and function of the
superficial layer in the articular cartilage and thus, can be targeted for OA treatment. Our objectives are to
understand the role of this novel signaling pathway in articular cartilage homeostasis and diseases, and to
seek approaches targeting this pathway for OA treatment. To achieve these, we will perform the following
aims: 1) determine the temporal role of EGFR signaling in OA pathogenesis; 2) elucidate the mechanisms of
the protective action of EGFR on articular cartilage; 3) investigate whether EGFR signaling is a promising
target for OA treatment. Complementary genetic approaches, such as EGFR vs Mig6, loss of function vs gain
of function, and aggrecan-CreER vs Prg4-CreER, will be used throughout the proposal. Moreover, we have
designed and synthesized TGFα-conjugated nanoparticles with prolonged retention and penetration abilities in
knee cartilage. A proof-of-principal experiment will be performed to examine its therapeutic effects on cartilage
degeneration at different OA stages. This proposal will uncover critical EGFR actions in knee articular cartilage
and provide crucial evidence for targeting this novel pathway in OA therapies. Once successfully
accomplished, this project could be quickly translated into large animal OA models followed by clinically
relevant applications that would eventually improve the health and well-being of the general public."

Does Health Insurance Promote Health through Providers and Networks?
Through their varying provider networks and coverages, health insurance plans directly and indirectly steer
patients toward some clinicians and hospitals and away from others. If providers differ in their quality of
care and especially if they provide better care for certain types of patients, such network variation can
meaningfully affect health outcomes at the plan level, and not just the provider level. Yet, consumers
selecting health plans lack information about which plans will direct them to better providers, obscuring this
potentially important channel to improving population health.
This project will develop novel outcome-based measures of insurance plan quality based on where
enrollees receive care, and taking account how causal impacts on health vary across provider networks. By
furthering the scientific understanding of the relationship between provider quality and patient outcomes at
the plan level, we aim to equip patients with new information for selecting insurance plans. Our measures
will also provide regulators with new instruments to reward plans that make people healthier.
At the core of our research plan are new, causal estimates of how mortality impacts vary across hospitals
and physicians and, in turn, across the health plans that rely on different provider networks. We focus on
older Americans enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans, leveraging novel data on the provider networks
used by different Medicare Advantage plans. The estimates will characterize which hospitals and providers
produce the best outcomes for beneficiaries with different demographics and comorbidities and thus which
plans are suitable for each type of patient by directing them to providers who produce good outcomes for
conditions they have or are likely to develop.
The project has four primary aims:
Aim 1: Measure and Validate Mortality Effects for Healthcare Providers
Aim 2: Link Physician and Hospital Mortality Effects to Plan Mortality Effects
Aim 3: Explore Heterogeneity in Mortality Effects Across Beneficiaries
Aim 4: Evaluate the Impact of Policy Proposals"
10872247,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epilepsy is among the most common serious neurological disorders, and about 40% of epilepsy patients do not
respond to existing treatment. Clinically, the prolonged, refractory epilepsy with negative surgical outcomes is
often associated with distributed epilepsy onset rather than a local epileptogenic zone. Understanding the
epilepsy as a large-scale brain network abnormality enables the development of new treatment options and
research directions. At present, the majority of research related to analysis of the epileptic network has been
focused on the ictal period, while few have been devoted to the analysis of the earlier stages of epileptogenesis
(latent period). Investigating the brain network properties of epileptogenesis is as important and can help
develop antiepileptogenic interventions for epilepsy prevention and cure. Early in our experiments, we
discovered pathological high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs), which are reliable biomarkers of epileptogenesis.
They are generated by clusters of pathologically interconnected neurons (PIN-clusters) and reflect bursts of
population spikes. Recent updates in the animal models of chronic epilepsy evidenced the spatially distributed
pHFO events, which implies the development of large-scale PIN-cluster networks during epileptogenesis. It is
critical to study the network topology and characteristics of PIN-cluster-formed epileptogenic networks in
order to further understand the underlying mechanisms of epileptogenesis.
To fulfill this gap, the present study plan is to explore pHFO-based networks using the Kainic Acid (KA)-
induced status epilepticus (SE) model of epileptogenesis. We hypothesize that epileptogenesis after SE is
dependent upon the formation of large-scale PIN-cluster networks that is expressed by the spatial occurrence
and temporal coupling of pHFOs. Combining the biocompatible, organic–material based neural interface array
(NeuroGrid) with multichannel silicon probes, we aim to identify the spatial and temporal profiles of pHFOs
(Aim1). Using the advanced computational algorithms such as graph theory analysis and Shannon Entropy
(SE), we propose to investigate the causal relationship and characteristics of the pHFO-based epileptogenic
networks (Aim2). The outcome of this study will assess the robustness of novel network-based recording design
and algorithm development. It will also determine whether the pHFO-derived network parameters are a
reliable biomarker of epileptogenesis. The future plans are to translate the pHFO-network concept and
computational tools into the clinical study of epilepsy. This approach may open a new direction to the
prevention of epilepsy development and cure epilepsy."
10872249,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysregulation of innate immunity is thought to be a significant contributor to Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
pathogenesis. We have focused on harnessing innate immunity via Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) to modulate age-
related defects in immune cells to counteract AD pathology. Our findings from multiple AD pathology transgenic
mouse models provide the first in vivo evidence that stimulation of innate immunity with TLR9 agonist CpG ODN
can reduce behavioral deficits and ameliorate all pathological hallmarks of AD. Most current immunotherapeutic
trials for AD have been associated with a major complication referred to as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities
(ARIA), which is linked to the presence and extent of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA is present in a
majority of individuals with AD, and its severity is an independent risk factor for cognitive decline. Hence, it is
critical to develop a therapy effective against CAA without inducing ARIA complications. Additionally, the
premature translation of promising transgenic mice data directly to patients has been associated with a very high
clinical trial failure rate. Our recent study established that squirrel monkeys (SQMs), an NHP model that develops
extensive age-dependent CAA unlike other primates, represent an opportune environment for demonstrating the
therapeutic benefits of our immunomodulation using CpG ODN 2006. Here we propose the use of class B CpG
1018, which is currently being tested in clinical trials for a variety of indications. The collective studies are
designed to provide a comprehensive portrayal of CpG 1018 efficacy and long-term safety by integrating biofluid
biomarker signatures with imaging markers, cognitive measures, in addition to neuropathology correlates.
Disease progression and safety will also be monitored by a combination of MRI techniques, which will enable
morphometric characterization and screening for ARIA. The utility of a multi-shell diffusion MRI model to follow
CpG 1018’s treatment effects in vivo on brain microstructural integrity, especially WM integrity changes, will be
validated for the first time. An additional strength of this proposal is the use of our powerful proteomic strategy
to unveil the first comprehensive characterization of the CAA and choroid plexus (CP) proteomes in association
with disease progression and CpG 1018 intervention. This localized proteomic approach is a preferred method
as it combines unbiased mass spectrometry examination with laser capture microdissection to precisely excise
defined neuropathological lesions. A further aim of this study is to map involvement of the CP-CSF system in
immune cell trafficking in response to CpG 1018. Delineating the CAA and CP protein signatures will advance
understanding of CpG 1018’s favorable immunomodulatory capabilities, as well as provide insights into CAA
pathogenesis to improve diagnostic capability. Overall, the interventions described here will provide
essential preclinical evidence that will enhance CpG 1018’s potential for clinical application."
10872252,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Actions are not mediated solely by cortical processes but rely on communication within basal ganglia-
thalamocortical loops. Speech is one example, although how the basal ganglia participate in this uniquely
human behavior is not clear, due to a lack of empirical data. For instance, the leading computational model of
speech production ignores the hyperdirect cortical pathway to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a basal ganglia
node that has been implicated in multiple cognitive processes relevant to speech production (e.g. action
selection and suppression, behavioral switching, gain modulation, motor learning). Recognizing that deep
brain stimulation (DBS) surgery offers the only opportunity to directly measure neural activity in the human
basal ganglia, we initiated studies to understand how motor and linguistic speech information is encoded
within the STN-sensorimotor cortical network. We established a novel experimental paradigm, where
electrocorticography (ECoG) is recorded simultaneously with STN single unit activity and local field potentials
(LFP), during DBS surgery in which patients are awake and speaking. We discovered that STN neuron activity is
dynamic during speech production, exhibiting behaviorally-selective inhibition and excitation of separate
populations of neurons. At the population level, we found that STN activity tracks with specific articulatory
motor features and with gain adjustment in articulatory movements. In addition, our data suggest a role for
the STN in speech planning, in that STN activity appears to be modulated prior to speech onset. These findings
led us to expand ECoG coverage to additionally record from areas involved in speech perception (superior
temporal gyrus) and planning (inferior frontal gyrus). Given the evidence in nonhuman primates for an
auditory basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop and the known hyperdirect projections from broad areas of frontal
cortex to the STN, we propose that hyperdirect pathways from both speech perception and speech planning
areas of cortex project to the STN and contribute to speech control. Supporting this idea, we have recorded
evoked potentials after STN stimulation that are consistent with antidromic activation not only in
sensorimotor cortex, but also from the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Our
principal hypothesis is that interactions between the STN and functionally distinct cortical regions contribute
to multiple aspects of speech, at the levels of perception, planning and modulation. Aim 1 uses stimulation
and functional connectivity measures to map the cortical-STN speech network. Aim 2, in parallel, probes
proposed basal ganglia functions relevant to speech, by simultaneously recording neural activity and speech
acoustics during an auditory repetition tasks that employs the Lombard Effect to selectively perturb speech
production. The resulting data will inform modifications to current models of speech production, which
subsequently will be tested with cue and response-locked intraoperative stimulation in Aim 3."
10872259,"We have recently discovered a novel oncogenic mechanism whereby cyclin D1 bypasses CDK4/6 inhibition
resulting in the stimulation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFKFB3) and glucose metabolism. The objective of this
proposal is to characterize the role of PFKFB3 in mediating adaptation or resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition and to
define new approaches to increase the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors in order to enable durable responses in
stage IV HR+ breast cancer patients. Deregulation of the estrogen receptor (ER)-cyclin D1-CDK4/6 pathway is
a hallmark of ER+ breast cancer that has prompted the development of CDK4/6 inhibitors. Although
administration of CDK4/6 inhibitors to patients with ER+ advanced breast cancers have resulted in an
improvement in progression free survival, almost all patients invariable develop resistance and relapse over time.
Activation of glucose metabolism upon CDK4/6 inhibition is becoming increasingly evident. A key stimulator of
glycolysis is the PFKFB3 enzyme which synthesizes fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a potent allosteric
activator of the rate-limiting 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK1). F2,6BP controls flux throughout the entire
glycolytic pathway and, as a result is required for the proliferation of cancer cells. In preliminary studies, we
provide evidence that PFKFB3 expression and activity is increased in response to CDK4 inhibition in ER+ breast
cancer cells and breast cancer patient tumors. Notably, we show that a PFKFB3 inhibitor, PFK-158, increases
the anti-tumor activity of anti-CDK4 targeted therapy in vitro and in vivo. We postulate that PFKFB3 is an
essential regulatory effector of the cyclin D1-CDK4/6 axis that serves to attenuate CDK4/6 inhibition effects by
stimulating glucose metabolism. Furthermore, we hypothesize that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of
PFKFB3 will increase the efficacy of CDK4/6 inhibitors by disabling the ability of the cell to sustain sufficient
glucose metabolism necessary for survival and growth. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which CDK4/6
inhibition induces PFKFB3 expression. Aim 2 will determine the effects of combined CDK4/6 and PFKFB3
inhibition on glucose metabolism, cell cycle, growth and survival in vitro. Aim 3 will examine the metabolic and
growth effects of pharmacological CDK4/6 and PFKFB3 inhibition as monotherapies and in combination in
mouse models of breast cancer in vivo. We anticipate that our studies will support the clinical testing of PFKFB3
inhibitors in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors to increase the survival of advanced ER+ breast cancer patients."

Parkinson's disease is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder. The underlying cause of
idiopathic Parkinson's is unknown. Importantly, prodromal inflammation of the midbrain has been found but remains
unexplained. Recently, we have discovered that dopaminergic neurons can enter a state of cellular senescence and
found significantly elevated numbers of senescent cells in the midbrain of human Parkinson's disease patients.
Cellular senescence is a program that gets activated upon DNA damage signaling and prevents mitotic cells from
uncontrolled proliferation. Most senescent cells express the so-called senescence associated secretory phenotype.
This phenotype is characterized by the secretion of proinflammatory factors that recruit immune cells and signal
“come here and eat me!”. We have also found that senescent human and mouse dopaminergic neurons secrete
pro-inflammatory factors and get removed by activated glial cells. The rationale underlying this proposal is that
cellular senescence is a generic mechanism in the midbrain leading to dopamine neuron loss which results in
Parkinson's disease. The three aims of the proposal focus on 1) unravelling the parkinsonism-related in vitro triggers
of cellular senescence in dopaminergic neurons; 2) the characterization of senescence-mediated activation of
immune responses and the in vitro spreading of senescence between cell types of the midbrain; and 3) the in vivo
induction and spreading of senescence between diverse cell types in the midbrain. In the proposed study, we will
identify pathways that induce cellular senescence in dopaminergic neurons and identify factors which are crucial for
the spreading of senescence and the activation of an immune response. Finally, we will assess whether ablation of
senescent cells in the midbrain at the right time point will interfere with the spreading and can thereby ameliorate the
loss of dopaminergic neurons of the midbrain. The molecular understanding of the induction of senescence as well
as the identification of released factors that are important to trigger brain inflammation will shed light on the general
pathomechanism of Parkinson’s disease and other age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Moreover, our findings
will have direct clinical implications to eventually develop methods to interfere with midbrain senescence to
ameliorate the progression of Parkinson’s disease."

 Persisters are antibiotic-tolerant cells that are genetically identical to the overall population that succumbs to
treatment, but they occupy a favorable phenotypic niche that enables survival. Persisters are an important
health concern because they are thought to contribute to chronic and recurrent infections, and recently, studies
have demonstrated that persisters can foster the development of antibiotic resistance. Fluoroquinolone (FQ)
persisters are particularly worrisome because FQs are one of the few antibiotic classes that can kill growth-
limited bacteria, and it has been shown that FQ persisters from stationary-phase populations experience de
novo mutation following treatment that not only accelerates resistance development for FQs but for
independent antibiotics as well (e.g., rifampicin, carbenicillin, D-cycloserine, fosfomycin). Recent work has
found that the chromosome copy number in individual bacteria (ploidy) is an important determinant of FQ
persistence, due to the inability of monoploids to conduct highly efficient homologous recombination to repair
FQ-induced DNA damage. Interestingly, polyploidy has been reported to increase the tolerances of bacteria to
diverse stresses. Here, we hypothesize that ploidy modulation could be a strategy to improve antibiotic killing
of growth-limited bacteria and reduce relapse infections. To test this hypothesis, we will identify DNA repair
requirements of monoploid and diploid persisters to FQs (levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin: most
commonly prescribed FQs); examine whether ploidy impacts killing by other antibiotics (UTI treatments:
nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; digestive tract treatment: rifaximin); and screen for compounds
(e.g., FDA-approved compound repurposing library) that enhance monoploidy (least tolerant ploidy state). To
accomplish these tasks, we will use Escherichia coli MG1655 (laboratory model), CFT073 (urosepsis isolate),
and UTI89 (uropathogenic), and measure ploidy with Hoechst 33342 (live cell nucleic acid stain), PicoGreen
(dsDNA stain for fixed cells), and a fluorescent protein-based origin reporter where the number of fluorescent
foci indicate the number of chromosomes. We will use fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to segregate
populations based on ploidy and then conduct persistence and antibiotic tolerance assays on those
subpopulations for wild-type and DNA repair mutants. In addition, we will screen a focused (FDA-approved
compound repurposing library) and diverse small molecule library for the ability to increase monoploidy in
growth-inhibited bacteria using Hoechst 33342 and high-throughput flow cytometry. Collectively, these
experiments will investigate how a phenotypic variable (ploidy) that often goes ignored impacts persistence to
FQs and other antibiotics. Further, this work will begin to examine that feature as a druggable target, with an
eye toward ploidy modulators (foster monoploidy) as new antibiotic adjuvants with anti-persister activity."

 Ragweed is one of the most predominant aeroallergens in the world and is a major causative agent of
allergic asthma in the global population. It is distributed widely; with increasing land growth and atmospheric
aerosolization across continents while it maintains its integrity due to an outer shell that is one of the strongest
biopolymers in nature. Air pollution, though, such as ground-level ozone, can induce significant and irreversible
changes in ragweed pollen (RWP) structure and chemical composition. The effects of ozone-induced changes
on RWP are poorly defined and represent an underappreciated consequence that ozone pollution may have on
people with allergic asthma, leading to increased morbidity. The goal of this proposal is to define the effects of
ozone on RWP and how these changes induce biological responses in vitro and in vivo that may exacerbate
asthma immunopathologies.
 Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), we have demonstrated that ozone exposure can lead to
rupture of RWP grains, which may enhance release of sub pollen particles (SPPs) that easily enter the lower
airways and promote inflammation. Using an in vivo model of asthma, we found ozone-exposed RWP (RWPO)
induces mixed neutrophilic/eosinophils inflammation in the airways in addition to elevated type 2 cytokines and
IL-6 levels in the lung as compared to unexposed RWP. When comparing defatted RWP (i.e, depleted of surface
lipids) to untreated RWP, we found that airway inflammation is reduced in vivo and alveolar macrophage (AMs)
and airway epithelial cells (AECs) produce less pro-inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Our central hypothesis is that
environmental ozone induces changes in the chemical composition and structure of ragweed pollen grains, which
result in increased activation of alveolar macrophages and lung epithelial cells and more advanced
immunopathology of the airways.
 In Aim 1 we hypothesize that specific atmospheric conditions increase the effects of ozone exposure on
the chemical composition of RWP and induce greater damage to pollen structure, allowing for easier
fragmentation of pollen grains. In different UV light and humidity conditions, RWP will be exposed to ozone and
then characterized for structure and morphology with SEM, surface molecular composition with Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS), as well as forces required
to break the pollen and to obtain SPPs. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that cell surface lipids from RWPO activate
AMs and AECs and promote robust pulmonary inflammation in response to ragweed pollens. We will complete
in vitro studies and in vivo mouse models of asthma with defatted and control RWPO to test this hypothesis. We
bring together expertise in air pollution chemistry and allergic diseases to investigate the role of pollution directly
on pollen grains and the mechanisms that promote pulmonary inflammation."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is recognized as a significant threat to the health of animals,
humans and plants, leading to calls to improve antimicrobial stewardship in all sectors. In order
to assure the best utilization of limited resources, there is a critical need to identify the
diseases and associated alternative strategies that, if implemented, would lead to the greatest
impact on improving antimicrobial stewardship. This proposal seeks to address this critical gap
with an approach that integrates evidence-based and decision-making methods such as
scoping reviews, structured expert elicitations (informed in some cases by proprietary large-
scale data and experience), and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) across four livestock
groups. This approach provides a comprehensive, systematic, and transparent framework to
identify and prioritize the most important disease, and then the most promising alternative
approaches to reduce the use of medically important antimicrobials in food animals, while
maintaining animal health and wellbeing. The proposed project is significant in that, in contrast
to the present situation, successful completion of the project will generate comprehensive and
nuanced assessments of the disease drivers and recommendations on how to mitigate
antimicrobial use in chickens, beef cattle, dairy cattle and swine. This integrated methodology,
combined with application to four major food producing species, allows for a consistent and
innovative approach to addressing the specific needs outlined by FDA in this PAR. This effort
will be led by the National Institute of Antimicrobial Resistance Research and Education
(NIAMRRE), a member organization that fosters cross-sector engagement to combat the
challenges presented by AMR, in collaboration with RTI International, a nonprofit research
institute with expertise in scoping reviews, expert elicitation, and multi-criteria decision analysis.
NIAMRRE expertise includes investigators and subject matter experts from four major
agricultural research universities with deep expertise in animal health and livestock production:
University of California Davis (dairy cattle lead), The Ohio State University (beef cattle lead), the
University of Georgia (broiler chicken lead), and Iowa State University (swine lead). Collectively,
this team provides an outstanding environment for successful completion of the project. The
outcome of this framework is that a consistent approach will be applied across four major
livestock species, resulting in consistent communications of recommendations for strategies to
reduce reliance on medically important antimicrobials."

 Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is primarily defined as a respiratory illness, up to 50% of
patients experience clinical gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. We
recently found that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes
COVID-19, infects and replicates in human small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). However, the molecular
mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 drives gastrointestinal pathology and how that impacts the mucosal immune
responses and systemic diseases remain unclear.
 In this proposal, our overall objectives are to better define the cellular signaling of SARS-CoV-2 interactions
with IECs, enteric immune responses, and microbiome in the context of health or inflamed intestines (i.e.,
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)). Our preliminary data suggest that compared to normal COVID-19 patients,
those with IBD who have higher expression of cathepsin L in IECs prior to infection, supported higher viral loads.
Our central hypothesis is that SARS-CoV-2 induces a distinctive intestinal pathology and mucosal immune
response that is shaped by host factors (IBD), luminal factors (bile salts and microbiome), and therapeutics.
Specifically, using healthy and IBD-derived organoids, COVID-19 patient fecal samples, SARS-CoV-2 variants,
and a highly tractable and innovative intraluminal injection mouse model, we aim to (1) define the host factors
and cellular mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection of normal and IBD epithelium, (2) determine the
impact of intestinal SARS-CoV-2 infection on intestinal immune response and colitis, and (3) define the
environmental factors that influence intestinal infection with SARS-CoV-2.
With extensive and collaborative expertise in intestinal biology, virology, and mucosal immunology (including
IBD), we expect to address mechanistically interesting and clinically important questions regarding SARS-CoV-
2 enteric infection, immune responses, and intestinal pathology. We anticipate that the knowledge derived from
this study will further our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 interactions with the epithelial and immune cells to
explain COVID-19 GI symptoms with or without IBD. We also expect the new information gained from this project
will expand our understanding of acute and chronic gastrointestinal pathology and symptoms of COVID-19,
provide novel strategies to mitigate COVID-19 associated GI diseases, and create a foundational knowledge
and tool set for deeper investigations into COVID-19 and potentially pathogenic and emerging coronaviruses of
the future."

Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other gynecologic cancer in the US. The dismal prognosis of
patients with advanced disease remains little changed in the past 30 years. New approaches are needed.
In the last grant cycle, our laboratory discovered that ovarian tumor cells and ovarian cancer tumor-initiating
cells (`cancer stem cells') acquire and retain substantially more iron than their non-malignant counterparts – a
phenomenon we named “iron addiction”. This enhanced iron acquisition and retention facilitates growth of
ovarian cancer. However, we found that this enhanced iron retention also makes ovarian cancer cells
exquisitely susceptible to drugs that trigger ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death.
Although iron is central to ferroptosis, little is known about how iron actually confers this susceptibility. In this
application, we test the hypothesis that iron plays critical, novel, and previously undescribed roles in
ferroptosis, and that new targets in the ferroptosis pathway that we recently discovered might lead to
successful interventions in ovarian cancer. We approach this problem with two broad objectives: 1) to better
understand the role of iron in ferroptosis; 2) to identify specific targets that will enhance the activity of
ferroptosis inducers by fostering pro-ferroptotic pathways both in ovarian cancers themselves and in the
ovarian cancer microenvironment.
Our Specific Aims are directed at these goals. In Aim 1, we pursue pilot observations that ferroptosis inducers
trigger a signaling network that fosters the generation of polyunsaturated lipid peroxides (the proximal
`executioners' of ferroptosis). We propose that ferroptosis is propagated by both 1) transcriptional activation of
iron-dependent pro-ferroptotic proteins that increase labile iron, and 2) engagement of a feed forward loop that
disables the iron-dependent lipid desaturase SCD1 that we recently showed protects against ferroptosis. We
will test our hypothesis using cell culture as well as murine models of ovarian cancer. In Aim 2, we use state-
of-the-art NanoSIMS imaging and MALDI-MSI to probe the sites of origin of the ferroptotic death signal, co-
localizing iron with the oxidized lipids that typify ferroptosis. We confirm and expand these findings using
organelle-targeted iron chelators. In Aim 3, we assess how cells in the ovarian tumor microenvironment modify
the response of ovarian cancers to drugs that induce ferroptosis. We focus on macrophages and fibroblasts,
cells that are critically involved in ovarian cancer metastasis, which we discovered in pilot studies exert
paracrine effects on lipid and iron metabolism that dramatically affect the degree of ferroptosis in ovarian
cancer cells.
Collectively, these experiments will enhance knowledge of ovarian cancer iron metabolism, explore regulatory
pathways not previously linked to ferroptosis, and define the contribution of the tumor microenvironment to
ferroptosis - efforts that will help to direct more effective use of ferroptosis inducers in ovarian cancer therapy."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is currently an incurable neurodegenerative disease that affects over 35 million people
worldwide, including 5.4 million individuals in the USA with a new case diagnosed every minute. Amyloids occur
commonly as key pathological features in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and despite
30 years of intensive research, important questions about the significance, mechanisms and role in pathogenesis
of amyloids remain unresolved. Because of the strong implication of amyloid Aß peptide in familial AD,
preparations of amyloid aggregates (oligomers, fibrils) have been featured in over 100,000 publications over the
past 30 years. In many cases, conflicting, contradictory and non-reproducible data obfuscate the underlying
mechanisms of pathogenesis. Advances in structural biology have established the structures of several distinct
types of amyloid, leading to the discovery that amyloid structures are highly polymorphic with the same protein
sequence adopting distinct beta sheet folds. Moreover, different structures seem to correlate with different
disease subtypes, indicating that structural variation plays a role in pathogenesis. This polymorphism and
structural heterogeneity may also underly the irreproducibility and conflicting results that have plagued amyloid
research. This suggests a critical need for well-characterized, standardized protocols for the preparation of
different types of amyloid Aß aggregates and reagents to authenticate these preparations and specifically identify
and quantify these polymorphs in vitro and in brain in order to support basic research to understand the roles
and mechanisms of amyloids in disease pathogenesis. Therefore, the overall goal of this resource initiative is
to establish a source network for the development of reagents and protocols for the production, standardization,
characterization, authentication of amyloid oligomers and fibrils and the dissemination of these materials to
investigators."

phases of training. Significant clinical exposure precedes graduate training to (a) ensure alignment of clinical
and research objectives and (b) facilitate the transition to research-intensive residencies and lifelong careers
as physician scientist. Training begins with thirty months of medical training (12 months of which consist of
required clinical rotations), during which students also participate in a journal club, advising activities and
research rotations that culminate in selecting a PhD advisor and program. During the PhD years, the MD/PhD
Program tracks milestones (preliminary exams, formation of dissertation committee, completion of training in
research ethics and reproducibility of research; publication requirements; re-entry timeline) to ensure
consistent, rigorous training across all PhD paths. The MD/PhD Program also incorporates mentor-mentee

The Emory Medical Scientist Training Program leverages our institution’s comprehensive academic programs
and diverse clinical training sites to create unique, interdisciplinary training opportunities that culminate in the
award of the dual MD/PhD degree. Under the Director’s lead, Co-Directors focus on clinical and research
phases of training. Significant clinical exposure precedes graduate training to (a) ensure alignment of clinical
and research objectives and (b) facilitate the transition to research-intensive residencies and lifelong careers
as physician scientist. Training begins with thirty months of medical training (12 months of which consist of
required clinical rotations), during which students also participate in a journal club, advising activities and
research rotations that culminate in selecting a PhD advisor and program. During the PhD years, the MD/PhD
Program tracks milestones (preliminary exams, formation of dissertation committee, completion of training in
research ethics and reproducibility of research; publication requirements; re-entry timeline) to ensure
consistent, rigorous training across all PhD paths. The MD/PhD Program also incorporates mentor-mentee

Southeast Asian (SEA) Americans are diagnosed with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) at 8 times the rate of the
general population and at twice the rate of other Asian Americans. Poignantly, most of these patients are
never treated for their cancer. These troubling observations – coupled with the candidate/her mentoring team’s
preliminary data which point to persistent, contemporaneous disparities in cancer care among SEA Americans
– provide the impetus for this K23 mentored career development application. This proposal is the logical next
step to support Dr. Tran’s long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator in disparity research in
HCC. The current proposal includes one of the first comprehensive approaches that focuses on social
determinants of health; builds on this team’s prior data on transportation/distance to cancer care to explain the
foregoing disparities; leverages resources from within the multi-site Mayo Clinic (Minnesota, Arizona, Florida)
and the 3-state (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa), community-based Mayo Clinic Health System; and capitalizes
on Dr. Tran’s passionate interests and growing expertise in HCC and disparities and on the capabilities of her
5 well-established mentors. This 2-aim proposal first seeks to characterize the social determinants of health –
specifically travel-limiting access to cancer care as well as other determinants including joblessness, trouble
finding childcare, limited education, and others – among Hmong and Vietnamese Americans and non-Asian
Americans. Dr. Tran will create and maintain a prospective cohort of patients with HCC – enriched with those
of SEA American heritage – to investigate the relationships between social determinants of health,
ethnicity/race, the rendering of cancer therapy, and cancer outcomes. Then, in aim 2, to understand barriers to
access of cancer care among SEA Americans with HCC, she will conduct one-on-one qualitative interviews to
learn directly from patients how to overcome barriers to the receipt of cancer care. She will also use these
interviews to explore low rates of viral hepatitis treatment and low rates of HCC screening. During the 5-year
grant period, Dr. Tran will acquire new skills in qualitative methods, statistics, and survey research through
coursework and hands-on experience. She will work closely with her outstanding multi-disciplinary team of
mentors (a medical oncologist, health disparity researchers, statistician, and qualitative researcher); develop
and hone skills in managing a multi-site team; acquire greater expertise in writing manuscripts, grants and
become more adept in presenting her data. The long-term impact of this research is to further understand and
obtain strong preliminary data on the social determinants of health in SEA Americans with liver cancer and to
position Dr. Tran to implement novel and feasible interventions in a future R01 application with the goal of
eliminating these disparities in SEA Americans with HCC."
10868415,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since the Institute of Medicine (IOM) released the seminal report, From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor:
Lost in Transition 13 years ago, there has been substantial progress in understanding the health issues
affecting cancer survivors, yet little has changed regarding survivorship care delivery. There remains a
disconnect between primary care providers and oncology care teams that has led to persistent problems
implementing risk-stratified survivorship care for cancer survivors.
With advances in cancer therapy and improved survival rates, the risk of death from cardiovascular disease
(CVD) now exceeds that of the cancer for many survivors. While cancer therapy may contribute to this risk, it is
generally a compilation of non-modifiable factors (i.e., genetics, aging), as well as modifiable lifestyle behaviors
(i.e., diet, exercise) that lead to both the cancer and to cardiovascular disease (CVD). With the lack of primary
care provider (PCP) integration in the cancer care team and time constraints and difficulty keeping up with
rapidly evolving non-cancer therapeutics for medical oncologists, there is an inferred lower priority for
comorbidity management.
We will determine the effectiveness of the multi-level iGuide intervention and the up-titrated iGuide2
intervention compared with usual care on the primary outcomes. The theory-driven, self-guided iGuide
intervention consists of patient-level components (video vignettes, patient-facing webinars) and PCP-level
components (electronic health record [EHR] automated cancer specialist-PCP letter, tele-education series, and
automated reminders). The up-titrated iGuide2 intervention consists of tailored patient-level video vignettes
and targeted EHR specialist-PCP communication.
The primary outcomes of the ONE TEAM SMART-design study are (1) Healthcare Effectiveness Data and
Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures of management of the three CVD comorbidities (hypertension, type
2 diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia) based upon laboratory and clinical measurement; (2) medication
adherence assessed pharmacy refill data using Proportion of Days Covered (PDC); and (3) patient-provider
communication (Patient-Centered Communication in Cancer Care). Secondary aims include exploring
moderating and mediating factors in each level of the intervention, support of patient-centered outcomes,
health care use, measures of provider activation, and costs of care resulting from the multi-level intervention.
The overarching goal of this proposed project is to optimize the management and outcomes of individuals with
cancer, both during and after treatment, and to develop a ‘low-touch’ multi-level intervention that can be
generalized, adapted and scaled in other health care systems. The proposed ONE TEAM study brings together
a multi-disciplinary research team with the necessary expertise and experience in survivorship research,
population and behavioral science, primary care, oncology, and biostatistics. Results from this intervention will
have important implications in the advancement of healthcare delivery for cancer survivors."
10868542,"The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), the largest professional, scientific and medical
society established to bring together clinical and laboratory-based scientists who are involved in the study of
bone, mineral and musculoskeletal science, has had a successful history of conducting annual topical meetings
funded by single year NIH R13 grants since 2002. More recently, ASBMR received two, three-year R13 grants
to cover pre-meeting symposia programs for 2016-2018 and 2019-2021. The current application seeks funding
for a three-year R13 grant to advance the field of musculoskeletal diseases by focusing on three specific areas
of scientific research in 2022, 2023 and 2024: 1) “Rare Diseases: From Molecules and Mechanisms to
Therapeutics”; 2) “Osteocytes in Bone Health and Disease and as Therapeutic Target Cells”; 3) “Energy
Metabolism in Skeletal Development and Disease”. These three symposia cover highly relevant areas of
musculoskeletal research that has recently undergone rapid evolution in scientific knowledge and collectively
contribute to major clinical morbidity disability and mortality. The overall objective of this R13 is to stimulate
further advances that will result in improved patient care for musculoskeletal diseases by bringing together the
best researchers for each of the three symposia. The symposia will review the state of the art in each topic area,
exchanging ideas with attendees, and stimulating the interaction between young and established researchers.
Symposia attendees will be encouraged to attend the subsequent ASBMR Annual Meetings for additional
opportunities to interact with musculoskeletal researchers. Programs for all three symposia were developed by
an organizing committee, and all speakers for the first two symposia have confirmed their participation.
Presenters include established and young investigators, women and men, and, since about half of ASBMR
membership is from outside the US, a number of key international speakers have also been invited. Poster
sessions, young investigator award presentations, and at the end of each meeting a “dine-around” evening are
planned to promote direct interaction between young investigators and more senior speakers. In 2022, the
symposium will gather international experts in rare bone diseases to discuss the latest advances on underlying
mechanisms and therapies, provide guidance to clinicians on how to recognize them, and lessons learnt from
rare diseases that have direct application to more common bone diseases such as osteoporosis. In 2023, the
symposium will review the advances in basic, translational and clinical research on the role of osteocytes in the
biology and pathophysiology of bone, and how to target osteocytes with therapeutic goals. The osteocyte role in
mechanobiology, hormone actions, cancer in bone and osteocyte endocrine actions will be discussed. The 2024
symposium will discuss the recent advances on the role of energy metabolism in skeletal development and
disease; including the role of hypoxia and mitochondria-mediated mechanisms, and its involvement in the
response of bone to anabolic therapies and metabolic diseases such as diabetes."
10868618,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our laboratory has developed unique tools that have enabled further progress towards
understanding molecular transport mechanisms involving three sub-cellular organelles in
eukaryotic cells: the nucleus, cytoplasm, and primary cilium. Macromolecular trafficking among
these compartments is suggested to be gated by two unique mechanisms. One is the nuclear
pore complex (NPC) embedded in the nuclear envelope that mediates bidirectional trafficking of
proteins and RNAs between the cytoplasm and the nucleus; the other is the transition zone (TZ)
located at the base of primary cilium that regulates the entry of membrane and cytosolic proteins
into the cilium.
Progress is intimately linked to technical improvements in biophysical research putting us in the
unique position to elucidate the fast kinetics and 3D transport routes of macromolecules as they
transport through the sub-micrometer NPC or TZ in live cells. In the first four years of the current
five-year MIRA grant, we have completed the development of single-point edge-excitation sub-
diffraction (SPEED) microscopy and successfully applied the new method to solve several critical
questions pertaining to nuclear transport and cytoplasmic-ciliary transport. We have included our
major findings in thirty manuscripts and published them in prestigious scientific journals such as
Nature Structural & Molecular Biology, Nature Communications, Protein Science, and Nature
Protocols.
Currently we are highly motivated to work on the following new research topics: 1) Development
of a new optical imaging system termed enhanced photon microscopy aiming at doubling photon
collection efficiency from fluorophores, which will significantly improve optical resolutions when
integrated with epifluorescence microscopy, laser scanning confocal microscopy, SPEED
microscopy and other super-resolution microscopy; 2) Mapping the spatial organization of
dynamic disordered protein motifs in the NPC to distinguish between, and advance upon, FG-
organizational models; and 3) Understanding the gating mechanism for the cytoplasmic-ciliary
transport of membrane proteins. In summary, during the next funding period of the MIRA grant,
we will continue to develop new microscopy imaging techniques and solve long-standing
unanswered questions in both nucleocytoplasmic and cytoplasm-cilium transport mechanisms."

 Ischemic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of death in the world and affects approximately 1% to 2%
of the general population. Sphingolipids, a lipid class bearing signaling properties, have been implicated in
numerous cardiac pathologies. Sphingolipids are formed by serine palmitoyltransferase, a heterodimeric enzyme
comprised of the subunits Sptlc1 and Spltc2. This heterodimer combines serine and palmitoyl-CoA to generate
dihydrosphingosine, which serves as a scaffold for generation of all downstream sphingolipids (e.g. ceramides,
sphingomyelins, glycosphingolipids, sphingosine-1-phosphate, etc.). Despite their implication in pathology,
sphingolipids are required by all eukaryotic cells; depletion of Sptlc2 in cardiomyocytes led to cardiac dysfunction
(Lee, SY et al. 2012 J. Biol. Chem). However, previously identified a novel pool of myocardial sphingolipids
These lipids arise from a dimerization of Sptlc1 with a novel SPT subunit, Sptlc3. We previously published work
showing that Sptlc3 is strongly induced in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Here we show that Sptlc3 is also induced in
human ischemic HF and in mouse models of both acute and chronic ischemia. The products of the Sptlc1/3
complex, which we showed are pro-apoptotic, also increase in human ischemic heart and mouse models.
Therefore, we propose that the canonical sphingolipids derived from Sptlc1/2 heterodimer are homeostatic, but
in some cardiac insults (lipotoxicity, ischemia) Sptlc3 is induced, changing the intracellular sphingolipidome and
leading to deleterious outcomes. This would present the opportunity for therapeutic intervention directed toward
atypical, Sptlc3-derived sphingolipids, leaving the homeostatic sphingolipid pool intact.
 The scientific premise behind our hypothesis is that sphingolipid metabolism could be targeted to prevent
ischemic injury. Our hypothesis is that ischemia induces these atypical sphingolipids, or a subset thereof, which
promote apoptosis and are thereby toxic to cardiomyocytes, and that blocking their production will attenuate
ischemic injury. This will be tested in 3 aims: 1-to test whether cardiomyocyte-specific depletion of Sptlc3
will attenuate ischemic injury and/or heart failure in acute or chronic ischemia in mice, 2-to determine the
mechanism(s) of Sptlc3 upregulation in acute vs. chronic ischemia and identify the downstream
metabolic pathways and resulting subset of atypical lipids that are produced; and 3-to determine the
mechanism(s) by which the atypical lipids induce apoptosis. This proposal will establish the role of non-
canonical sphingolipids in ischemic cardiomyopathy and will lay the foundation for further research on potential
targeting of the pathway as an innovative therapeutic option to prevent ischemic injury and heart failure and
improve patient outcome."

The proposed research focuses on the application and development of magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR
as a tool for structural investigations of amyloid peptides and proteins. The research covers four major
topics.
A. Structure of Amyloid Peptides and Proteins
 (1) Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40: Using 1H detected and DNP magic angle spinning (MAS) and cryoEM we plan the
 following experiments on Aβ: (a) a determination of the structure of Aβ1-40; (b) the structure of the
 pathologically important plaque seeded Aβ1-42; (c) the structure of the N-terminal tail and the binding of
 antibody Aducanumab to the tail; (d) and the structure of mutants for Aβ1-42.
 (2) Beta-2-microglobulin (β2m) and DeltaN6-β2m: We plan to determine the structure of the 93 AA β2m-DeltaN6 variant of the dialysis related amyloidosis (DRA) protein. In addition, DeltaN6 is thought to be the
 catalyst that seeds β2m plaques in-vivo. We therefore also intend to study mixtures of β2m and DeltaN6.
 (3) Amyloid polymorphism: We intend to determine the structure of the three polymorphs of the
 amyloidiogenic peptide GNNQQNY from Sup35. These are present in a consistent 1:1:1 population
 and will provide the first study of the manner in which defined structural changes alter 13C and 15N
 shifts. 1H, 13C and 17O NMR will be used to characterize the structure around the H2O molecules in
 the GNNQQNY lattice.
B. NMR methods None of the above structural studies would be possible absent NMR methods to assign
 spectra, measure distances and torsion angles, to enhance signal intensities, etc. We therefore plan
 to continue the development of the methods essential for these structural investigations. (a) We plan
 to continue these experiments by initially preparing U-17O/13C/15N GNNQQNY to further develop the
 spectroscopy and then to apply it to spectroscopy of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40. The experiments will employ 1H
 detection and DNP in order to optimize the sensitivity. PAR and PAIN have been essential to MAS
 NMR structure determinations but they are semiquantitative methods to measure 13C-13C and 13C-15N
 distances. Using SPINEVOLUTION software and experiments on model systems, we plan to develop
 these approaches into quantitative distance measurement techniques."
10868705,"Abstract:
 The loss of lung endothelial barrier function and endothelial cell (EC) death is a primary pathogenic feature
of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although it appears that fundamental immune cell processes
are at the core of ARDS-mediated vascular injury and dysfunction, the actual mechanism of endothelial cell
death regulated by immune cells remains largely unknown. As a result there are currently no effective
pharmacologic therapies. In order to develop more effective therapeutic strategies, it is therefore necessary to
understand the precise mechanisms that link immune cell function to vascular dysfunction.
 This proposal focuses on a new molecular paradigm whereby immune cells (monocytes) drive endothelial
cell death. Our extensive supportive data have lead us to formulate the overarching hypothesis that links lung
endothelial injury during ARDS to the pyroptotic function of monocyte/macrophage derived GasderminD
(GsdmD) encapsulated in circulating microparticles(MP) in association with purinergic receptor, P2X7. To
determine the specifics of this novel pathway, we propose the following specific aims. In Aim1, we will
delineate the role of monocyte derived GasderminD in mediating endothelial pyroptosis in the mechanism of
ALI. We will use available murine model along with in vitro and ex vivo model of ARDS patients to study
GsdmD mediated endothelial injury. In Aim2, we will determine the regulation of MP encapsulated GsdmD’s
cytopathic function by monocytes. We will study the mechanism how phosphorylation of GasderminD regulates
its cytopathic behavior and vulnerability to ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Finally, in Aim3, we will delineate
the role of P2X7 in the mechanism of MP GsdmD mediated endothelial cell death. We will study the
mechanisms of extracellular MP-associated GsdmD engagement to target cells mediated by the functional
purinergic receptor P2X7.
 These studies will be the first to elucidate the injurious behavior of extracellular GsdmD in coordination with
the purinergic receptor, P2X7 encapsulated in MPs, which may play a central role in lung injury. Execution of
these studies will lay the foundation for a significant mechanistic advance regarding the cellular interplay
between immune cells and endothelia that may provide opportunities for devising novel therapeutic targets that
lessen the severity of lung vascular injury."
10873025,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the US; however, we do not fully understand the pathogenesis of
COPD and lack disease-modifying therapies. Forkhead box protein P1 (FoxP1) is a transcriptional repressor that
participates in lung epithelial development. Recent data from the UK Biobank, ECLIPSE, and COPDGene
cohorts implicate FoxP1 as an important predictor of airflow limitation. However, a role for FoxP1 in the
pathogenesis of COPD remains unexamined.
 Preliminary work suggests that FoxP1 protein is reduced while FoxP1 mRNA is increased in the lungs of
humans and mice with COPD compared with controls. Specifically, we find that exposure to cigarette smoke
causes the E3 ligase FBXO24 to ubiquitinate FoxP1, resulting in its proteasomal degradation in lung epithelial
cells in vitro. The resulting loss of FoxP1 protein increases FoxP1 mRNA because FoxP1 is known to repress
its own promoter. Unexpectedly, loss of FoxP1 protein increases activity of the unfolded protein response (UPR)
as well as levels of the UPR’s apoptosis inducer C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in lung epithelial cells.
Analyses of publicly available FoxP1 ChIP-seq data demonstrates significant enrichment for FoxP1 binding sites
in the promoters of key UPR genes and CHOP in human embryonic stem cells and HepG2 cells. Further,
computational studies identify high probability binding sites for FoxP1 in the DNA sequence of UPR and CHOP
promoters. In vivo, deletion of CHOP reduces apoptosis and emphysema in the lung. Finally, inducible deletion
of FoxP1 by intranasal administration of Cre expressing adenovirus to floxed FoxP1 mice increased cigarette
smoke induced emphysema. Therefore, we hypothesize that cigarette smoke causes FBXO24 to ubiquitinate
and degrade FoxP1 protein in the lung epithelium thereby increasing promotor activity for key UPR genes and
CHOP and inducing apoptosis and emphysema.
 During this award, we will: (1) Test the hypothesis that FoxP1 binds to and suppresses the promoters of
key UPR genes and CHOP in lung epithelial cells by CUT&RUN and luciferase reporter assays, as well as map
FoxP1 binding sites via promoter mutagenesis studies; (2) Test the hypothesis that deleting the FoxP1 gene in
the lung epithelium will increase cigarette smoke induced UPR activity, CHOP, and apoptosis in the lung
epithelium, and increase emphysema; and (3) Test the hypothesis that deleting the FBXO24 gene will prevent
cigarette smoke induced degradation of FoxP1 protein and reduce cigarette smoke induced UPR activity, CHOP
and apoptosis in the lung epithelium, and decrease emphysema. This proposal will investigate the mechanism
for a novel link between FoxP1 and the UPR, demonstrate the functional impact of this mechanism in vivo, and
test the efficacy of counteracting FBXO24 as a therapeutic strategy for COPD in preclinical models. This proposal
reflects our long-term objective of developing new mechanism-based therapies that may have unprecedented
disease modifying ability in COPD."
10873026,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Significant research efforts are currently underway to understand and prevent the pathogeneses of Type
1 and Type 2 diabetes, both of which are associated with the gradual loss of functional insulin-producing b cells.
Progress has been made with using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) populations as alternative sources of
islet cells; however, the efficient production of pure populations of fully functional b cells has not yet been
achieved. Furthermore, the current protocols result in highly variable differentiations depending on the stem cell
source, differentiation procedure and user. In addition, both endogenous and stem cell-derived islet cells display
inherent phenotypic instability and often undergo spontaneous dedifferentiation and/or reprogramming in
pathophysiological conditions, which results in the loss of cellular identity and phenotypic dysfunction. These
challenges suggest that there is still a great need to identify the precise transcriptional and epigenetic
mechanisms that promote the specification and maintenance of islet cell identities.
 We and others have demonstrated that development and maintenance of b cell identity requires the
continuous activity of several non-redundant transcriptional programs. Although many of the transcription factors
that are essential for maintaining a and b cell phenotypes have been characterized, we lack a complete
understanding of how cell-specific gene programs are regulated to specify and maintain these closely related
cell lineages in mice, and there are varying reports related to their respective roles in human pancreas
development. This proposal will allow us to gain a more complete understanding of the basic molecular
mechanisms underlying islet cell differentiation and the maintenance of islet cell identity/function; this knowledge
will pave the way to improved human islet cell differentiation protocols and the identification of better treatments
for islet cell dysfunctions in diabetes. These studies are facilitated by increased access to novel and improved
molecular technologies. Furthermore, our studies in rodent models are providing important biological and
physiological context that will be directly translated into the hPSC differentiation system. Our first aim will
characterize the differential molecular mechanisms that regulate a vs b cell programs in mice. We will focus on
the combined molecular activities of NKX2.2, NKX6.1, KLF4 and CHD4 in regulating endocrine cell fate
decisions. We will also take an unbiased approach using combined single cell ATAC-Seq and RNA-Seq to
characterize the transcriptional landscape associated with islet cell fate decisions in vivo. The second aim will
characterize the role of the chromatin modifier protein CHD4 in regulating b cell development and function, and
in modulating NKX2.2 and NKX6.1 regulatory activities. The third aim will begin to apply this knowledge to the
directed differentiation of human islet cells from hPSCs. We propose to identify the necessary and sufficient
functions of NKX2.2 and NKX6.1 in regulating a and b cell fate decisions. We will also use this platform to identify
the chromatin and gene expression landscapes regulated by NKX2.2 and NKX6.1 during these lineage choices."
10873029,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The burden of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) is growing as the
global population ages. Consistent with a newer model of geroscience, clinically detectable cognitive impairment
and AD/ADRD are hypothesized to represent the end of a lifelong aging process in which genetic predisposition,
environmental insult, and lifestyle factors interact to drive pathology. In fact, many risk factors for AD/ADRD are
measurable in childhood and midlife many decades before clinical detection. This lifespan view of aging,
together with the disappointing results of AD/ADRD prevention trials in late life, suggest that there is a promising
opportunity to design interventions that target at-risk individuals in midlife to slow the aging process before
debilitating brain decline has been cemented. Shifting AD/ADRD prevention research to midlife, however,
presents a significant challenge: identifying viable outcomes of intervention. In a typical clinical trial, incidence
of AD/ADRD is the intervention target as well as the measured outcome. While methodologically sound, this
design will be challenging to export to midlife because it will require trials to last 20 or more years to use
AD/ADRD diagnosis, which is uncommon before 65, as the outcome. One alternative strategy is to find midlife
surrogate biomarkers that index sub-clinical changes in biology and cognition that are indicative of premorbid
AD/ADRD. Such premorbid changes in midlife biology and cognition could further help identify causal disease
mechanisms. In this competing renewal application, we propose to quantify individual differences in midlife for
one such group of potential surrogate biomarkers: MRI measures of structural brain integrity, which are known
to be associated with AD/ADRD later in life. Specifically, we propose to follow up at age 52 a population-
representative cohort of 1037 infants born in one city in one year and comprehensively studied ever since: the
Dunedin Study. Through our prior award (R01AG049789), we successfully collected high-quality, reliable MRI
measures of structural brain integrity at age 45 in 93% of still-alive and participating Study members (N=875).
The proposed second wave of MRI data collection at age 52 will allow for the quantification of individual
differences in at-risk structural brain changes (e.g., greater increase in WMH, cortical thinning, and hippocampal
atrophy) between ages 45 and 52. We will then examine the extent to which these individual differences are
predicted by AD/ADRD risk indexes, trajectories of cognitive decline, and the pace of biological aging, which we
have tracked across five decades. We will also map individual differences in at-risk midlife structural brain
changes onto blood AD/ADRD biomarkers. Importantly, the Dunedin Study design allows for testing of
associations in the absence of age and/or cohort effects in a large population representative sample. The very
low attrition and absence of attrition bias further afford opportunity to examine associations across the full-range
of cognition including low- and high-functioning individuals. These features will help generate novel translational
findings of immediate impact for midlife AD/ADRD intervention and prevention research."
10870503,"Abstract
The spondyloarthropathies (SpAs) are human diseases, characterized by sacroiliitis and overlapping clinical
features, of unknown pathogenesis. The prototypical SpA, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), is one of the best known
and strongest examples of a disease associated with an HLA allele, specifically HLA-B27, an association known
for 50 years. Since HLA-B27 is a major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecule, it seems likely
that it is involved in disease pathogenesis by presenting peptide antigens on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to
CD8+ T cells, the canonical function of MHC-I molecules. However, due to lack of direct support of this
hypothesis, and conflicting data from previous HLA-B27 rodent models, other hypotheses became more
favored, even though genome-wide association studies and lack of association of AS with certain HLA-B27
alleles that affect peptide display support a role for HLA-B27 in antigen presentation in disease. Recent studies
from the applicant’s laboratory in collaboration with an international group showed clonal expansion of certain
T cell receptors (TCRs) on CD8+ T cells in the joints of patients with AS and eye of patients with anterior
uveitis, a frequent complication of the SpAs, that can occur in isolation and is also associated with HLA-B27.
These TCRs were used to identify peptides from bacterial and human proteins that are presented by HLA-B27
to trigger TCR reporter cells. Importantly, several of these TCRs recognized both bacterial and self-peptides
presented by HLA-B27. Crystallographic studies showed the basis for this TCR cross-reactivity. These studies
strongly suggest the overall hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis of AS, the basis for this proposal: Antigen-
specific CD8+ T cells in HLA-B27+ individuals clonally expand in response to bacterial challenge then attack
normal tissues expressing the cross-reactive self-protein(s). To test this model, the applicant proposes here to
create a mouse expressing a relevant TCR and HLA-B27 for such mechanistic immune response studies that
are otherwise impossible to pursue in humans. To avoid other technical and knowledge limitations of prior
HLA-B27 rodent models, they will produce other modifications. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this proposal
are to: 1) Generate HLA-B27 mouse models; and 2) Perform functional analyses of T cells and APCs in HLA-
B27 mice. Thus, this proposal will lead to the development of a mouse model for detailed mechanistic studies
to further explore the pathogenesis of HLA-B27 in AS and related diseases, and indeed lay the foundation for
mechanistic studies of other HLA-associated autoimmune disorders."
10873244,"In high HIV prevalence regions, women are at high risk for HIV during pregnancy and breastfeeding. To protect
women and reach elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission, the World Health Organization recommends
offering oral tenofovir (TFV)-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to HIV-negative pregnant and postpartum
women in high-burden settings. Although most pregnant Kenyan women with HIV risk factors accept PrEP when
offered, >50% discontinue PrEP within 30 days of initiation and sub-optimal adherence is common. To date, no
intervention studies to improve PrEP adherence include pregnant or postpartum women. We adapted an SMS
communication platform (mWACh) to send PrEP-tailored, theory-based SMS to facilitate adherence among
pregnant women who initiate PrEP. In a non-randomized pilot, we found that mWACh-PrEP recipients were more
likely to persist with PrEP use and to self-report high adherence. We propose a randomized trial to determine
the effect of the mWACh-PrEP tool on PrEP adherence during pregnancy through the postpartum period. We
will also gather data on cost and delivery using the Proctor Implementation Outcomes Framework to expedite
translation into routine practice. Our overarching hypothesis is that mWACh-PrEP will improve PrEP adherence
among mothers at-risk for HIV, be acceptable to patients and providers, and be cost-effective. By leveraging our
team’s research infrastructure in Western Kenya, we are uniquely positioned to execute the following AIMS:
Aim 1- To determine the effect of the mWACh-PrEP tool on PrEP adherence during pregnancy through the
postpartum period among women who initiate PrEP within ANC-PrEP. We will conduct a 2-arm randomized trial
comparing mWACh-PrEP vs standard of care (SOC, i.e. in-clinic adherence counseling) among HIV-uninfected
pregnant women with high HIV acquisition risk (defined by validated risk score) who initiate PrEP. The primary
outcome will be adherence at 6 months postpartum (TFV hair levels >0.038 ng/mg; consistent with 7 pills/ week).
Secondary outcomes will include STI incidence, adherence cofactors, and prevention-effective adherence (time-
varying alignment of adherence with risk behaviors). Exploratory outcomes will include HIV incidence and
perinatal outcomes by arm. Hypothesis: mWACh-PrEP will increase PrEP adherence compared to SOC.
Aim 2– Evaluate barriers and facilitators of mWACh-PrEP implementation within routine ANC. Using the Proctor
framework, we assess acceptability and feasibility by conducting interviews and focus-groups with ANC-PrEP
users, providers, and health planners. Hypothesis: Indications for readiness of mWACh-PrEP will be identified.
Aim 3– Estimate the cost-effectiveness of implementing mWACh-PrEP within ANC-PrEP, per HIV infection and
disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. We use data from Aims 1 and conduct micro-costing and time-and-
motion studies to estimate the cost of mWACh-PrEP from a payer perspective. The incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio (ICER) per HIV infection and DALY averted compared to SOC will be calculated. Hypothesis:
Incorporating data on PrEP and ANC outcomes with improve ICERs for mWACh-PrEP."

In the past decade, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been rising in incidence, and is linked to a 2-4 fold
increase in developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias later in life1–5. TBI presents as a progressive
neurodegenerative injury characterized by cognitive deficits and neuropsychiatric impairment4,6. Currently,
there are no available treatments to prevent, slow, or reverse the chronic progression of neurodegeneration and
accelerated AD after TBI. In many neurodegenerative conditions, including AD, Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, aberrant mitochondrial fission has been identified as a critical component of
pathogenesis7. It has also been implicated in the acute stages of concussive TBI8–10. The goals of this project are
to characterize the changes in regulation of mitochondrial fission that occur in acute and chronic TBI, and to
determine whether pharmacologically limiting aberrantly high mitochondrial fission after TBI provides a
neuroprotective strategy for TBI and TBI-induced accelerated AD.
To address my goal, I propose the following aims, using an established mouse model of TBI:
 1. Determine how TBI affects expression, modification, and activity of the key mediator of mitochondrial
fission, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1). I will measure expression of Drp1 across a comprehensive list
 of brain regions at early and late timepoints after TBI. I will also measure post-translational
 modifications, oligomerization activity, and expression of regulatory proteins of Drp1.
2. Determine how pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial fission after acute TBI mitigates pathology
and symptoms at acute and chronic timepoints after TBI. I will administer injured mice with P110, a
 small peptide inhibitor of the key mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 which has already been
 determined to be neuroprotective in TBI, and then investigate pathological changes across an array of
 histological measures, ultrastructural changes via transmission electron microscopy, and bioenergetic
 changes via Seahorse analysis.
3. Determine the efficacy of P110 treatment in mitigating TBI-induced acceleration of Alzheimer's disease.
I will administer P110 to 5xFAD mice following mild TBI, and use behavioral testing to determine
P110's efficacy in reducing accelerated neurocognitive deficits. I will also use histological methods to
monitor changes in plaque deposition as a function of TBI and P110 treatment.
Through completing this project, I will acquire new lab techniques, including behavioral testing,
immunohistochemistry, biochemical assays, and both confocal and electron microscopy. I will also foster
collaboration with researchers in related fields of neurodegeneration, and develop clinical insight into the field
of neurodegeneration. This proposal outlines a rigorous training plan by which I will establish the skills needed
for a successful career as a physician-scientist in the fields of neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatry."

The main objective of the Central Administrative and Management Core (CAMC) is to serve as the anchor and
to provide administrative oversight for the Comprehensive NeuroHIV Center (CNHC) at Temple University and
Drexel University in Philadelphia. The overall objective is to improve and expand research related to neuroHIV
and neurological diseases associated with viral infection of the CNS including neurobehavioral impairment and
mental disorders. The infrastructure created by the CNHC during the last 10 years offers unique expertise to
local, regional, and national neuroHIV investigators with focus on our strengths of gene editing and delivery,
mammalian progenitor cells and iPSC cultures, assist investigators with genetic analysis of virus-infected cells
before and after editing procedures, and support for a full-range of state-of-the-art microscopic and imaging
analysis. At the same time, the CNHC will coordinate the NeuroHIV Community Partnership and Disparity Core
affecting PWH, the newly developed core that is now included in our program. The CAMC will assist with liaising
with current and potential community partners in fostering synergy among the patient population and the
participant researchers. Tkhe Center offers its unique expertise in functional cellular assays including
microelectrode array assay to study neuronal cell behavior in response to external stress. Furthermore, the
Center will enable investigators to initiate clinical and neurobehavioral examination with a well-established cohort
of people with HIV (PWH) longitudinally examined at Drexel University College of Medicine. The CAMC will
provide the infrastructure for coordinating and overseeing all activities of the CNHC and facilitating synergistic
interaction among the cores and other NIMH-supported Centers. The CAMC will delineate the strategic plan,
identify short- and long-term objectives, execute detailed plans to be implemented, carry out internal and external
reviews and assessment tools based on established criteria to ensure productive and efficient use of resources
to achieve the overall objectives of the CNHC. It will also offer biostatistical support for data analysis and
interpretation obtained from the basic science and clinical cores. In addition, this Core will coordinate with the
Scientific Cores to disseminate information to the participants as well as Core users, recruit Core users, solicitate
pilot applications, catalogue all original data generated by the Cores, facilitate and track all material distributed
by the Cores, including, but not limited to, cell lines, viral stocks, and clinical specimens."

The current HIV-1 pandemic is one where people living with HIV (PWH) have had well-suppressed infection with
therapy for prolonged periods of time. This has guided research towards focusing on (i) comorbidities (aging,
cardiovascular, cancer, metabolic, and immune activation), (ii) side effects of ART, (iii) neurocognitive and
behavioral disorders (occurs approximately 40% of time), (iv) socioeconomic inequalities, stigma and
discrimination, sexual and gender disparities, interpersonal relations, and neuropsychological problems including
depression across the PWH community, and (v) new therapeutics and cure strategies. Research advances in
these diverse areas require an interdisciplinary approach with participation of investigators in basic, behavioral,
and clinical research. Toward this end, the overall aim of the Developmental Research and Mentorship Core
(DRMC) is to provide support for innovative pilot projects in neuroHIV and. HIV research addressing emerging
scientific priorities and mentorship of the next generation of HIV researchers. The DRMC will provide
infrastructure and support for pilot investigations, progress evaluation, guidance, and mentorship. This Core
application describes the progress during the current funding period, experience of the Core Directors, the
process to recruit and review innovative project applications, and the role the Core will play in mentorship of
clinical and basic science faculty and trainees at various levels. In the last five years (years 6-10), 19 (5 from
cost share) awards were given mostly to junior investigators. Awardees of pilot monies have been extremely
successful with 31 published manuscripts and 9 grants awarded from research related to the recent pilot grants.
Over the next 5-year period, the DRMC will fund six pilot applications per year. Two will be funded by the. DRMC
and four from institutional support to provide a more optimal pilot project program and to expand our efforts to
enhance the recruitment and development of underrepresented minority (URM) research investigators. With
regards to mentorship, the short-term goal is to assist junior, more senior faculty new to HIV, and URM faculty
in developing a successful proposal for pilot study funds. The long-term goal will be to provide training and
mentorship to awardees that will foster and strengthen their careers in neuroHIV into the future. The DRMC will
provide an organization and structure that will effectively integrate new project development, funding of
preliminary research, mentorship and establishing new interdisciplinary collaborations. The DRMC will work
closely with the Central Adminstrative and Management Core (CAMC) and scientific cores to promote high
research priorities and overarching objectives of the CNHC. It is anticipated that this core will play a pivotal role
in enhancing and ensuring the success of neuroHIV investigators, expand outreach and support of URM, and
advance neuroHIV research and execution of the CNHC mission."

The current human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) pandemic is one where people living with HIV (PWH)
have had well-suppressed infection with therapy for prolonged periods of time. This has guided research towards
focusing on (i) comorbidities (aging, cardiovascular, cancer, metabolic, and immune activation), (ii) side effects
of antiretroviral therapy (ART), (iii) neurocognitive and behavioral disorders (occurs approximately 40% of the
time), (iv) social and structural determinants of NeuroHIV disparities, and (v) new therapeutics and cure
strategies. All of these areas rely on access to PWH and associated samples from PWH. Given these high-
priority areas of research, the Clinical and Translational Research Support Core (CTRSC), led by Dr. Wigdahl,
will have as its main SERVICE OBJECTIVE to enroll participants (White, Black, Hispanic and corresponding
uninfected participant cohorts) to continue the development of a rich and well-managed clinical population that
can provide data, advice, technical expertise, and reagents to address many of these questions. One of the main
research themes of this center focuses on latency, reservoirs, and cure strategies including reservoirs like the
central nervous system (CNS). As such, there is a pressing need to understand the genetics of the viral reservoir
and the genetic nature of the HIV-1 quasispecies in individuals well-suppressed by ART. Immunophenotyping
will also be performed to understand the immune response in PWH experiencing the aging process as well as
other comorbid conditions including substance abuse. In addition, having longitudinal samples from
neuropsychologically well-characterized PWH will facilitate longitudinal investigations involving biomarkers and
immune factors underlying neuroHIV. The CTRSC will accomplish these goals by (1) refinement and utilization
of the clinical cohort to examine parameters of HIV-1 disease and a number of comorbid factors (Szep/Pirrone),
(2) utilizing comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation to characterize the nature, progression, and
correlates of neurocognitive impairment in HIV-1 (Schultheis/Devlin), and (3) characterization of virological and
immunological parameters (Nonnemacher/ Haddad). The CTRSC will interface with the Central Administrative
and Management Core (CAMC) and will work closely in Aims 1 and 2 with the NeuroHIV and Community
Partnership and Disparities Core (NHCPDC). It will use the Viral Gene Editing and Bioinformatics Core (VGEBC)
for experimental design and informatic support of next-generation sequencing services (Aims 1 and 3) and the
Cell Biology and Functional Analyses Core (CBFAC) to help develop cell lines and isolate and develop primary
cell populations (Aim 3). Finally, the CTRSC will interact with early-career and established investigators from
within and outside the HIV community to develop new research questions and grants using the Developmental
and Research Mentorship Core (DRMC) and by providing scientific guidance in discovery, translational/clinical,
or behavioral/neuropsychological aspects of neuroHIV. Services will be advertised broadly internally at Drexel
and Temple and extramurally."
10873684,"SUMMARY
Despite many people with HIV (PWH) having well-suppressed infection with antiretroviral treatment (ART), some
populations of PWH experience disparities in their engagement in the HIV care continuum from timely HIV
diagnosis to viral suppression. These disparities, particularly the delayed initiation of ART and disruptions to HIV
care and ART adherence, may place populations deemed at risk or hard to reach at further risk of neuroHIV-
related complications, including neurocognitive impairments and neurobehavioral sequelae as well as other
comorbid clinical problems. Reducing HIV-related health disparities and health inequities is one of the four goals
of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy. The Comprehensive NeuroHIV Center (CNHC) is well-positioned not only to
support research that addresses the mechanisms of neuroHIV, but also how to facilitate exciting interdisciplinary
collaborations to investigate, prevent, treat, and address disparities that may contribute significantly to neuroHIV-
related disease in marginalized populations. By supporting a community-engaged research paradigm, the CNHC
will maximize the impact of neuroHIV scientists’ research for populations affected by health disparities while
leveraging community members’ expertise about their needs, strengths, and experiences. Thus, in this renewal,
we have initiated the NeuroHIV Community Partnership and Disparities Core (NHCPDC) to foster community-
partnership and interdisciplinary collaborations that examine, address, and prevent disparities involving
neuroHIV. The NHCPDC will aim to (1) conduct a community needs assessment to refine the Core’s research
infrastructure services; (2) serve as a primary resource to guide culturally competent research that engages
communities and addresses neuroHIV disparities; and (3) disseminate research findings in bidirectional
communication with the local and broader community to address neuroHIV disparities. The NHCPDC will work
in synergy with the Central Administrative and Management Core to complement its support by aiding research
involving neuroHIV disparities; the Developmental Research and Mentorship Core to support a diverse group of
researchers and NHCPDC-related studies; and the Clinical and Translational Research Support Core to enhance
its services for culturally competent research and expand its recruitment efforts involving underrepresented
groups at greater risk of developing neuroHIV; and all Cores, including the Viral Gene Editing and Bioinformatics
Core and the Cell Biology and Functional Analysis Core, to help disseminate findings and facilitate community
awareness and involvement with respect to the development of neuroHIV. The Core will increase the number of
interdisciplinary collaborations and resulting studies and publications. In synergy with the other Cores, the
NHCPDC will enhance the quality of the neuroHIV research enterprise by supporting research related to
neuroHIV disparities and the continuum of HIV care to prevent, treat, and understand neuroHIV disease in
marginalized populations most at risk."

The failure of traditional mental health services to significantly reduce the disproportionate involvement of
people with serious mental illnesses (SMI) in the criminal justice system highlights a basic but overlooked fact:
mental illness is not a primary driver of criminal justice involvement. Research has consistently shown that
people with mental illness face the same risk factors for justice involvement (i.e., “criminogenic” risk factors) as
those without mental illnesses. Research has also found that justice-involved people with SMI have high levels
of criminogenic risk factors and that these risk factors mediate their risk of recidivism. Yet, most interventions
for justice-involved people with SMI do not target criminogenic risk factors as a goal of treatment. This gap
between research and service provision represents untapped potential to reduce rates of justice involvement
among people with SMI, by expanding their continuum of services to include interventions that directly target
criminogenic risk factors. Our recent NIMH-funded randomized controlled trial (1R34MH111855-01; PI: Wilson)
demonstrated that when adapted for use with people with SMI, criminogenic-focused interventions can
successfully engage key treatment targets and outcomes associated with criminogenic risk factors among
prisoners with SMI. Given that up to 50% of people with SMI receiving treatment in the community-based
mental health system have had some criminal justice system involvement, developing criminogenic-focused
interventions for delivery in community mental health settings has great potential to optimize their potential
impact, both in terms of the numbers of people with SMI who can benefit and in terms of potential reductions in
future criminal justice involvement. This R34 proposal brings together a team of nationally recognized experts
to engage a deployment-focused approach to the development and preliminary testing of a new, scalable, and
sustainable group-based, criminogenic-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy intervention developed
specifically for use among people with SMI in community-based mental health settings. This proposed study
includes three aims. The first aim will engage user-centered design methodologies to optimize the
development of the new intervention. The second aim will conduct a small pilot randomized controlled trial to
test the preliminary effectiveness of the new intervention. This pilot trial will engage an experimental
therapeutics approach to examine how the new intervention engages the intended treatment targets and
outcomes. The third aim will use qualitative research methods with key stakeholders to identify implementation
strategies that both maximize and expediate the scalability and sustainability of the new intervention in
community based mental health settings."

Childhood obesity remains highly prevalent in the United States and is a major contributor to chronic disease.
Evidence suggests that obesity in childhood persists into adulthood, predisposing children to cardio-metabolic
diseases. Despite national efforts to expand prevention and treatment, racially/ethnically diverse children and
those from low-income households have not benefitted equally from such efforts. Children require coordinated
and frequent care for weight management, but multiple socioeconomic and geographic barriers, exist for children
living in low-income households and perpetuate health disparities. Better solutions are needed to improve access
to care and ongoing participation that impact health outcomes. Telehealth is an approach that can improve
access, participation, and mitigate barriers, though simply using it is not sufficient to promote equitable access;
other barriers may be introduced and result in inequities. The key question is: how can we modify in-person
pediatric weight management programs for telehealth to be equitable? The goal of this mixed methods study is
to examine telehealth approaches for childhood obesity to understand multi-level factors that impact access and
participation in care and adapt a pediatric weight management program for telehealth. For this mentored career
development application, we propose leveraging Connect for Health, a study funded by NHLBI and Patient
Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) that is implementing an in-person pediatric weight management
program. Guided by implementation science frameworks, we will analyze electronic health record (EHR) data of
current telehealth approaches, conduct qualitative interviews, develop targeted telehealth adaptations to
Connect for Health, and pilot test the optimized telehealth program. My overarching hypothesis is stakeholder-
informed telehealth adaptations will result in equitable access to the Connect for Health pediatric weight
management program. As a clinician-scientist, the long-term goal of my research is to optimize pediatric health
care delivery by improving health outcomes and access to care through implementation science. I have
assembled a mentorship team with expertise in childhood obesity, health equity, and implementation science.
Along with my research and training plan, I will develop skills in advanced quantitative analyses, mixed methods
design, and implementation science that will enable me to achieve my career goals."

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a devastating microvascular complication of both type 1 (T1D)
and type 2 diabetes (T2D). It has been shown to have a heritable component, but prior searches
for the genetic determinants of this condition have had limited success. In the Genetics of
Nephropathy – an International Effort (GENIE) Consortium, a collaboration between Queen’s
University Belfast, University of Dublin, University of Helsinki, University of Michigan, University
of Pennsylvania and the Broad Institute, we have leveraged an ongoing co-funding mechanism
between Ireland, Northern Ireland and the US. This international genomics consortium
enucleated a larger Diabetic Nephropathy Collaborative Research Initiative, which coalesced to
assemble nearly 20,000 samples from participants with T1D, with and without kidney disease.
We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and discovered 16 new signals at
genome-wide significance. The strongest signal centered on a protective missense coding
variant at COL4A3, which encodes an integral component of the glomerular basement
membrane, implicating this aspect of kidney biology in DKD. In this award, we propose to build
on this established infrastructure to undertake the following Specific Aims: (1) to significantly
expand our sample size by including ~150,000 samples with DKD in the context of T2D, thereby
substantially increasing our power to discover shared and distinct risk factors for DKD in T1D
and T2D, and to use computational tools to derive biological insights into DKD pathogenesis; (2)
to generate a genome-wide epigenomic dataset in both peripheral blood and human kidney to
inform the relevance of genetic findings, enable the construction of predictive tools, and infer
causality via Mendelian randomization; and (3) to create an experimental pipeline centered on
animal, cellular and organoid models of DKD to pursue functional validation of promising genetic
findings. This ongoing close collaboration of multidisciplinary and synergistic research groups
should advance our knowledge of the molecular determinants of DKD, identify potential
molecular targets for therapeutics, and facilitate clinical prediction."

Predictive models play an essential role in disease prevention and control. Recent advances in scientific
research have allowed more thorough and in-depth data collection from epidemiological studies (e.g., GPS
data, climate data, wearable device data). However, due to the many variables collected and the relatively
short time frame for epidemiological data collection during some of the epidemics, missing information is
unavoidable, and subsequent updates of the database may be necessary. How to incorporate data with partial
information, i.e., with missingness, and predictors measured dynamically over time, into existing models to
perform more accurate and efficient predictions remains a challenge. Recently, the PI and his team have
developed predictive models for various purposes among several neglected and emerging infectious diseases,
including schistosomiasis, COVID-19, and human seasonal influenza. While conducting these studies, we
identified several practical issues prohibiting a broader implementation of the proposed models, such as
missing data and a lack of adaptive mechanisms based on dynamic inflows of predictors. Existing models
adopting the complete data analysis approach will significantly reduce the statistical power and cause potential
bias. Moreover, predictive models applied in epidemiological infectious disease studies often rely on historical
data collected up to a time point without taking into consideration of future data inputs. Meanwhile, the
development in statistical and machine learning methods laid the foundation for new dynamic predictive
models based on trajectory data, with recent progress in functional concurrent regression and incremental
learning. However, these methodological advances have been poorly integrated into field applications. Even in
recent COVID-19 research where advanced dynamic models have been developed, balancing the data flow
and prediction window has not been well studied. In addition, existing models often require a large amount of
variable collection, so a practical two-stage approach allowing limited data collection early on can be more
time- and cost-effective. In this MIRA proposal, we aim at refining predictive models for several neglected and
emerging infectious diseases. Specifically, three coherent projects with distinct research activities will be
pursued, which include: 1) refining hotspot prediction models for schistosomiasis interventions; 2) development
and validation of prognostic risk models for COVID-19 in the US, with methods development on missing data
handling and functional regression for dynamic prediction; 3) development and validation of a vaccine benefits
score for human seasonal influenza. The refined models are expected to be accompanied by new and more
general predictive algorithms involving missing data processing and dynamic prediction mechanisms to
enhance model performance and adaptability. The methodological development from this proposal will also
inform other epidemiological studies with similar challenges and have a broader long-term impact beyond the
scope of the infectious diseases covered in the currently proposed projects."
10890033,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have word-learning difficulties, with particular
weaknesses in developing rich semantic representations over time that can be flexibly applied to new contexts.
This negatively impacts academic performance, functional independence, and quality of life. Despite this, there
are very few evidence-based intervention techniques that have been directly examined in children with ASD.
Within the psychological learning literature, there is a promising teaching technique that highlights not only the
input that individuals receive when learning but also opportunities to recall or produce newly taught information.
The retrieval of new information is not only important for the assessment of learning, but for learning itself. It is
believed that effortful retrieval practice (repeated spaced retrieval RSR) enhances encoding because retrieval
of new information prompts individuals to identify features of the word or concept that are necessary to
reconstruct the material, which leads to an enriched and potentially elaborated memory trace to support future
retrievals. Although retrieval practice studies have yielded robust learning effects in adults, its application to
child learning is in its infancy. Given the striking learning effects that have been documented in adults and
some emerging findings in children with developmental language disorder, retrieval practice has great potential
to enhance word learning in children with ASD. RSR holds promise for children with ASD because its use has
been found to facilitate not only learning of word form (corresponding to the sounds that comprise a word), but
also word meaning (corresponding to semantic features associated with the newly taught word), which is a
particular weakness in children with ASD. Also, RSR may be a key clinical approach to use with children with
ASD because it has been found to strengthen not only item-specific learning (e.g., labeling pictured referents
that were explicitly taught), but also to enable generalization (e.g., correctly applying newly taught adjectives to
novel referents or labels to different referents of the same kind). Thus, Study 1 will assess whether RSR of
newly taught labels (nouns) results in more robust learning of word form and meaning of nouns relative to a
learning schedule that has the same amount of study without retrieval (repeated study, RS). Also, Study 1 will
examine whether RSR promotes generalization in children with ASD in a task that tests children's extension of
labels to referents that are similar to but distinct from the referents that were explicitly taught. Study 2 will
assess whether RSR facilitates adjective learning, which allows for more stringent analysis of broader
language learning and generalization. Across Studies 1 and 2, addressing specific aim 3, we will examine
generalization using pictures of similar referents (Study 1) or similar attributes on novel referents (Study 2).
Lastly, we will assess whether ASD severity moderates the RSR effect, after controlling for cognitive and
language abilities, addressing specific aim 4. Findings from this study will inform our theoretical understanding
of language acquisition in children with ASD and will lead to clear clinical implications."

Patients with high-risk TP53 aberrant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have a shorter survival than other
CLL patients. We previously found that the BTK inhibitor acalabrutinib (A) and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax
(V) are highly effective at killing CLL cells ex vivo. We developed AVO, a new time-limited triplet combination
regimen combining AV with an anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab (O). The AVO clinical trial and correlative
laboratory studies on primary samples from this trial comprise the key elements of this project.
The first aim of the project is to determine the efficacy of the AVO combination regimen in patients with
previously untreated TP53 aberrant CLL. We hypothesize that AVO will be a highly efficacious and well-
tolerated novel agent triplet regimen, with individualized therapy duration guided by achievement of
undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD). This hypothesis will be tested through determining the
proportion of patients who achieve complete response (CR) with uMRD, as well as characterizing the safety of
the regimen, in an investigator-initiated, phase 2, multicenter clinical trial of AVO in patients with previously
untreated CLL.
The second aim of the project is to assess whether MRD clonal dynamics, pre-treatment mitochondrial priming,
or genomic complexity predict clinical response to AVO. We will utilize a next-generation sequencing (NGS)
based technology, Adaptive ClonoSEQ, to assess whether MRD clonal dynamics with this assay can more
accurately predict survival and guide treatment duration decisions compared with conventional flow cytometry-
based MRD. Through functional interrogation of CLL cell mitochondria by BH3 profiling, we hypothesize that
patients with higher levels of mitochondrial priming at baseline and/or early on treatment will achieve a higher
rate of CR with uMRD on AVO. Genomic predictors of response will also be assessed through stimulated
karyotype and mutational profiling with a 95-gene NGS ‘rapid heme panel’ (RHP).
The third aim of the project is to elucidate mechanisms of resistance to AVO, including acquired somatic
mutations, modulation in mitochondrial priming, alterations in phosphorylation, and kinase activity. We will use
RHP to evaluate the pattern of somatic mutations as they develop. We will also evaluate whether CLL cells
that are typically dependent on BCL-2 at baseline will develop alternative survival dependencies on other anti-
apoptotic proteins at progression. In addition, we will assess whether BCL-2 family protein phosphorylation
may represent a functional resistance mechanism, and whether PP2A activators can help reverse this and
thereby restore sensitivity. And we will use high-throughput kinase activity mapping (HT-KAM) to identify which
kinases are activated in resistant patients to identify new, potentially therapeutically actionable targets.
Elucidating resistance mechanisms will inform the design of future novel agent combination therapy trials, with
the goal of decreasing the risk of acquired therapy resistance in CLL and eventually other B cell malignancies."

Our proposed efforts align directly with a goal of RFA-NS-18-019: optimization of transformative technologies
for modulation in the nervous system. Specifically, we seek to optimize microelectrode arrays (MEAs) and
ultra-microelectrode arrays (UMEAs) for large-scale circuit manipulation that will control neural activity at
cellular resolution with high temporal resolution. Our goals are to 1) advance CNS MEA and UMEA electrical
microstimulation by testing the separate hypotheses that MEAs and UMEAs can deliver safe, effective levels of
cortical electrical stimulation and 2) advance research by generating transformative tools and technologies that
will be widely used throughout the research community. Here we propose combining computational modeling,
engineering optimization, and in vivo measurement to address these challenges and produce advances in
microstimulation and tools for the community. Our Aims are to 1) engineer approaches to non-damaging
charge, 2) engineer approaches to enable selective and graded activation of targeted neural elements, and 3)
document the performance of the innovations from Aim 1 and Aim 2. Via an outstanding team working together
to address this interdisciplinary problem, our innovative approach will result in 1) models to deliver non-
damaging currents from MEAs and UMEAs; 2) evaluation of the models to optimize MEA and UMEA design for
microstimulation; and 3) experimental assessment of the outcomes of our designs, both within our team and
with our collaborators. Our transformative results will lead to model-based optimization of reliable and high-
fidelity multichannel microstimulation technologies enabling sustainable, broad dissemination and user-friendly

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder caused primarily by the
degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Current therapies for PD are palliative but no
disease-modifying therapies exist today. Mutations in the VPS35 (PARK17) gene have been identified as a
cause of late-onset, autosomal dominant PD, with a single mutation (D620N) detected in PD individuals and
families worldwide. How mutations in VPS35 precipitate dopaminergic neurodegeneration in PD remains
obscure. It is critical to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration due to
VPS35 mutations in order to understand the pathophysiology of PD and develop new therapeutic strategies.
VPS35 is a core component of the retromer complex responsible for the recognition and sorting of
transmembrane protein cargo from endosomes to the Golgi network or plasma membrane for recycling. How
familial mutations influence VPS35 retromer function in PD-relevant neuronal populations and animal models is
not known. We have developed a novel viral-mediated gene transfer model of PD in adult rats where the
overexpression of human D620N VPS35 induces the degeneration of nigral dopaminergic neurons, thereby
formally establishing a pathogenic role for the D620N mutation. In the present application, we propose to exploit
this disease model to elucidate the full repertoire of PD-related neurodegenerative phenotypes induced by
D620N VPS35, including the development and progression of dopaminergic neuronal and axonal degeneration,
striatal catecholamine and motoric deficits, neuropathology, protein aggregation and ultrastructural
cytopathology, and altered macroautophagy, as a function of increasing transgene dosage (Aim 1.1). We will
evaluate perturbations in retromer protein interactions by quantitative proteomic analyses of brain tissue from
this model and primary neurons to identify putative molecular mechanisms underlying the D620N mutation, and
we will determine whether selected protein interactors are important for neurodegeneration (Aim 1.2). Our
studies will also clarify the mechanism of the dominant D620N mutation in this rodent PD model and will address
whether D620N VPS35 may act in a dominant-negative manner. Accordingly, we will use viral vectors to deliver
short hairpin RNAs to silence VPS35 expression in nigral dopaminergic neurons of rats to create a VPS35 loss-
of-function model and conduct rescue experiments with human VPS35 variants to determine whether the D620N
mutation is functional or impaired (Aim 2.1). Similar rescue studies will be conducted in new conditional VPS35
knockout mice with selective deletion in neurons (Aim 2.2). Finally, we will evaluate the interaction of VPS35
with LRRK2 in this rat model of PD to determine whether LRRK2 kinase activation is critically required for
neurodegeneration induced by D620N VPS35. We will determine if LRRK2 deletion (Aim 3.1) or pharmacological
kinase inhibition (Aim 3.2) in this rat model is neuroprotective. Our proposal is novel, innovative and timely and
will provide critical insight into the mechanisms of PD-linked VPS35 mutations using transgenic rodent models."

 Protein-ligand binding events underlay all life processes. Protein design tests and extends our knowledge of
protein folding and function through the creation of proteins from scratch. This proposal aims to develop a
computational method for the design of proteins that bind to any small molecule with high affinity and
selectivity. The state-of-the-art in ligand-binding protein design critically relies on random experimental
optimization and screening. If we truly understand how proteins bind small molecules, we should be able to go
directly from computer models to tight binders. The hypothesis that drives this proposal is that proteins use a
vast but now enumerable number of molecular interaction motifs combinatorially throughout evolution to create
the binding sites of modern-day proteins. Computational methods will be employed to uncover this set of
interactions in the large database of protein structures available in the protein databank (PDB). Binding sites
will be designed by sampling motifs for all functional groups of a ligand onto a protein backbone. We call this
design method Convergent Motifs for Binding Sites (COMBS). COMBS was used to design ABLER, the first
ligand-binding protein designed from scratch to bind its target ligand—the antithrombotic drug apixaban—with
an unprecedentedly high affinity, without experimental optimization of sequence. ABLER has potential clinical
relevance as an anti-clotting antidote, although that is outside the scope of the proposal. High-resolution crystal
structures of ABLER agree with the design model, both in overall topology and the intended molecular
interactions with the ligand. Aim 1 of this proposal focuses on designing variants of ABLER to increase affinity
and probe the molecular bases for the observed drug-protein interactions. Aim 2 focuses on the role of water in
ligand-binding protein design, motivated by the water-mediated protein-ligand interaction found in the crystal
structure. In this Aim, I will curate a database of water-protein interactions from the PDB and use these to
sample water-mediated protein-ligand interactions during design. I will also learn to use explicit-water
molecular dynamics simulations to critically assess the roles of water in binding. Aim 3 uses COMBS to redesign
the binding site of pyrrolysine tRNA synthetase for incorporation of charged unnatural amino acids (such as
sulfotyrosine) into mammalian cells, since laboratory evolution and library screens for this goal have so far been
unsuccessful. These aims will augment my training in molecular biology, computational protein design, and
protein structural characterization (X-ray crystallography and NMR). The K99 portion of this work in the
DeGrado lab will expose me to all aspects of the scientific process, from inception to publication. Bill is a world
expert in protein design, and his insight is critical to the success of the project. At UCSF, I will gain much through
my regularly scheduled meetings with Ethan Weiss, who brings the perspective of a physician scientist with a
long history of antithrombotic research and clinical applications. My collaboration with UCSF professor Lei
Wang will expose me to the field of unnatural amino acid incorporation and will be critical for applying COMBS
to the most impactful targets for mimics of post-translational modifications. The research and training proposed
herein will greatly complement my current skillset and background, which will be essential to my research
program as I transition into an independent principal investigator."

 The interaction between our diet, metabolism by the microbiome, and the downstream biological effects
on the host are key foundational knowledge that will guide the development of precision medicine integrated
with nutrition. To characterize the function of these individual metabolites that are transformed from foods or
fully synthesized by the microbiome will improve the mechanistic understanding of Microbe-Diet-Host
interactions. Despite this importance, the community lacks a knowledge management center that centralizes
and aggregates bioactivity and function of these metabolites that hinders the ability of researchers to reuse
knowledge in a high throughput fashion and build off the discoveries of others. The proposed “Collaborative
Microbial Metabolite Center” or CMMC proposed here will fill this void in the scientific landscape, aiming to
integrate microbial metabolite discovery and activity from PAR-21-253 grantees and the broader microbial
metabolomics community. The CMMC will build a centralized microbial metabolites bioactivity knowledge base
that aims to work with the grantees and community to define standards to represent bioactivity, handle
community depositions of knowledge and supporting raw data, aggregate depositions into corroborated
knowledge, apply knowledge to new data, propagate knowledge into previous uncharacterized molecules, and
integrate with other community knowledgebases that host complementary knowledge for microbial metabolites.
All data, knowledge, and tools will be made findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).
 This proposal will 1) Build the web portal for microbial metabolites with search, export, and analysis
functions. 2) Build a microbial metabolite knowledgebase with the accompanying R01 grantees, NIDDK, and the
larger scientific community. 3) Coordinate data sharing activities, training and technical support and organize a
yearly meeting.
 The PIs and Co-Is are well suited to address the needs and build the proposed knowledge base, due to
their expertise in microbial metabolomics (Dorrestein), microbiome (Dorrestein, Knight), knowledge base
creation (Dorrestein, Wang, Knight, Bandeira), community outreach (Dorrestein, Wang), platform training

10895325,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Thrombosis is the leading cause of mortality among patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). MPNs
are characterized by excessive production of red blood cells, platelets, and/or leukocytes. Thrombosis risk in
MPNs is thought to be primarily secondary to excess clonal MPN cells. However, at present, the interaction
between the vascular endothelium and clonal MPN cells is poorly characterized. Clonal MPN growth is driven
by dysregulated Janus kinase-signal transductor and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling. The
JAK2V617F+ mutation occurs in up to 70% of MPN patients and increases the risk of thrombosis 6-fold.
Additionally, MPN patients have a higher risk of VTE in slow-flow splanchnic vasculature. Several in vitro and
in vivo studies demonstrate that endothelial cells (EC) with the JAK2V617F+ mutation express pro-adhesive and
thrombotic proteins, suggesting that EC signaling may contribute to increased thrombosis. My primary
objective is to define how EC activation contributes to MPN thrombosis. My central hypothesis is that within
the EC vascular, the JAK2V617F+ mutation evokes a pro-inflammatory and thrombotic cascade. In preliminary
studies, I evaluated blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOEC) isolated from JAK2V617F+ patients. In JAK2V617F+
BOECs and in TNF-α-activated JAK2WT ECs, ruxolitinib and fedratinib (JAK1/2 inhibitors approved for use in
MPN) reduced tissue factor (TF) expression and activity. Additionally, Compared to JAK2WT ECs, JAK2V617F+
BOECs express higher levels von Willebrand factor (VWF), and growth arrest specific 6 (Gas6) protein. Gas6
is a vitamin-K dependent protein S homolog, which promotes both TF expression and triggers platelet and
monocyte activation after binding to receptors Axl, MERTK, and Tyro3. Interestingly, in preliminary studies,
JAK2V617F+ individuals had significantly higher plasma levels of Gas6, Axl, and MERTK than controls.
Importantly, recent work has shown that blockade of the Gas6-Axl pathway kills JAK2V617F+ hematopoietic stem
cells in vitro and reduces spleen size and prolongs survival in JAK2V617F+ mice. However, these studies did
not evaluate whether the Gas6-Axl-MERTK axis contributes to MPN thrombosis. Phenotypic variability
limits use of JAK2V617F animal models to assess hemostasis and thrombosis. Therefore, I propose to use
endothelialized microfluidics models to assess how JAK2V617F expression increases EC activation. Using an
endothelialized microfluidics model, I will culture JAK2V617F+ EC under physiologic shear to assess for changes
in pro-coagulant and adhesive function. Furthermore, I will assess pro-adhesive and thrombotic interactions
between JAK2V617F+ EC and whole blood. I will also explore how Gas6-Axl-MERTK signaling in JAK2V617F+ ECs
increases the pro-coagulant and pro-adhesive environment. Collectively, the proposed research will establish
the contribution of shear to JAK2V617F+ EC activation and evaluate Gas6-Axl-MERTK signaling in JAK2V617F+
pro-thrombotic activation."

Over one million people live in U.S. nursing homes, two-thirds of whom have Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (AD/ADRD) and one-quarter of whom are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Dual-eligible
residents with AD/ADRD often receive low-quality nursing home care at high costs, due in part to the conflicting
financial incentives created by Medicaid and Medicare. Nursing homes rely on generous Medicare payments
for short skilled nursing home stays. At the same time, nursing homes care predominantly for Medicaid-funded
long-stay residents, stays for which Medicaid payment often does not cover the costs. This creates conflicting
incentives for nursing homes and fragmented care for dual-eligible residents. This includes high rates of
potentially avoidable hospitalizations as nursing homes shift the high costs of caring for a sicker resident to a
Medicare-paid hospitalization. It also causes nursing home residents to cycle between the nursing home and
hospital, increasing the use of Medicare-covered skilled nursing home stays on return to the nursing home,
which may be unnecessary and costly to Medicare. One potential solution to these conflicting incentives is for
states to increase Medicaid per-diem rates, which would decrease the Medicaid-Medicare payment differential.
This would better align incentives for nursing homes to provide higher-acuity care for residents rather than
transferring them to the hospital. It would also eliminate the incentive to provide Medicare-funded skilled care
due only to the higher profitability of these stays, rather than the potential clinical benefit to residents. Another
potential solution is to use globally capitated payments for nursing home stays, which hold nursing homes
financially accountable for spending. A prominent example of this is Medicare-established institutional special
needs plans (I-SNPs) for dual-eligible nursing home residents. I-SNPs are specialized Medicare Advantage
plans that bear risk for all Medicare-covered spending for nursing home residents and as a result, may
incentivize nursing homes to invest in capabilities to better manage high-acuity residents in the nursing home
rather than in the hospital, allowing nursing homes to higher-intensity skilled care without a preceding
hospitalization. Despite the promise of these approaches and urgent need to decrease fragmentation, little is
known about how to reform nursing home payment to accomplish this. This is particularly important for
individuals with AD/ADRD given their large numbers in nursing homes, high likelihood of being dually enrolled
in Medicare and Medicaid, the high costs of care, and poor outcomes from unnecessary and burdensome
transitions of care. Our overall objective is to examine ways to align the historically misaligned incentives
created by the Medicare and Medicaid programs in nursing homes and, in doing so, substantively improve care
for residents with AD/ADRD. These results will provide critical and rigorous evidence on how to integrate
Medicaid- and Medicare-funded care for dual-eligible nursing home residents with AD/ADRD and improve
outcomes. These results will inform current policy debates and future directions of ongoing integration efforts."

 The abnormal aggregation of transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) in neuronal
inclusions is the defining pathologic hallmark of approximately half of frontotemporal lobar degeneration cases
(FTLD-TDP). Substantial heterogeneity exists in the clinical disorders associated with FTLD-TDP, which
reflects regional differences in neurodegeneration. Neuropathologic studies have suggested that the regional
cortical burden of aggregated TDP-43 may be responsible for neurodegeneration and ensuing clinical
heterogeneity. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the region-specific accumulation of aggregated
TDP-43 are not understood. We hypothesize that: 1) in view of the subdivision of FTLD-TDP Types (A-D) and
variability in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathologic change (LATE-NC),
presence of atypical neuropathologic features may signal novel TDP-43 structures and post-translational
modifications (PTMs); 2) among TDP-43 proteinopathies, each neuropathologic phenotype is related to a
distinct structure of TDP-43 filaments, TDP-43 PTMs, and seeding properties. To investigate these
hypotheses, we propose to combine our collective expertise in neuropathology, molecular genetics, molecular
characterization of misfolded proteins, fluorescent multiplex immunohistochemistry, digital spatial profiling,
quantitative digital image analysis, and cryo-electron microscopy to study our study population, which includes
clinicopathologically well-characterized cases from the Dementia Laboratory’s Brain Library and cases from
other researchers. The project specific aims provide a foundation for in-depth analysis of TDP-43
proteinopathies. Aim 1 combines innovative neuropathologic methods for mapping TDP-43 inclusions,
misfolded TDP-43 in different neuronal and glial populations, glial response, and for determining how TDP-43
amyloid folds relate to the phenotype. Aim 2 leverages cutting-edge technology to identify novel PTMs that
coexist with the presence of misfolded TDP-43. RT-QuIC assay might reveal differences of TDP-43 seeding
properties. Aim 3 uses the most advanced cryo-EM technology to determine the structures of the TDP-43
amyloid filaments."
10885454,"Project Summary
 Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that develops after exposure to a
traumatic event. Despite the availability of evidence-based treatments for PTSD, over half of patients dropout of
these treatments prematurely, and up to 72% still meet criteria for PTSD at posttreatment. Thus, there is an
urgent need to identify the factors that increase risk of PTSD to guide prevention and early intervention strategies.
Sleep disturbances (i.e., difficulties falling or staying asleep) are a significant risk factor that contribute to PTSD.
Sleep disturbances are common within the acute aftermath of trauma and thus represent a treatment target for
early intervention to prevent PTSD. However, the ability to leverage this information for preventive efforts is
thwarted because individuals vary in their susceptibility to stress-related sleep disturbances, yet no research has
identified who is at greatest risk of sleep disturbances within the acute aftermath of trauma. This precludes the
ability to triage high-risk trauma patients most in need of early intervention. Further, despite understanding sleep
disturbances increase PTSD risk, we do not know the mechanisms that explain this relationship and hence
cannot yet develop early interventions focused on specific mechanisms that modify risk for the disorder.
Therefore, this study aims to: 1) identify individuals with a trait susceptibility to acute sleep disturbances after
trauma, and 2) determine the mechanisms by which these sleep disturbances predict PTSD.
 This study will leverage data from the AURORA study (NIMH U01MH110925), a large emergency
department-based network that longitudinally followed trauma survivors from the acute aftermath of trauma (e.g.,
motor vehicle collision) to one year later. The AURORA dataset includes multiple assessments of patient-
reported outcomes and psychophysiological functioning, including objective sleep using actigraphy and fear
extinction using fear-potentiated startle. The applicant will learn to use these psychophysiological methods to
accomplish the study aims, as well as skin conductance response and heart rate, and advanced statistical
techniques for longitudinal analyses. To support the applicant’s long-term career goals of investigating the sleep
physiology underlying mechanisms of PTSD risk, the applicant will also receive advanced training in sleep
physiology and polysomnographic (PSG) assessment, such as quantitative measures of PSG using spectral
analysis, with a special focus on Rapid Eye Movement sleep. This study is expected to be significant because it
will enable the early identification of potentially vulnerable individuals who might develop PTSD, toward whom
sleep-focused preventive efforts can be targeted. This is a vital step in reducing the significant burden that PTSD
imposes on both the individual and society because efforts to prevent PTSD require the ability to accurately
screen for risk to target those most in need of early interventions. This is a major priority of the NIMH and is
directly in line with Objective 2.2 of its Strategic Plan of identifying and understanding risk factors, biomarkers,
and behavioral indicators of mental illness."

 Brain metastasis (BM) affects millions of cancer patients and represents an unmet clinical challenge.
Advances in targeted- and immuno-therapies have prolonged cancer patients’ survival via better control of
primary cancers and extracranial metastases, but the incidence of BM is increasing steadily upon disease
recurrence. Sadly, patients having symptomatic BMs do not respond well to current treatments and have
extremely poor survivals. The brain has unique structural and biological features, thus the interaction of BM
tumor cells with the brain physical environment are distinctive and underexplored. Deeper understanding of these
unique interactions is critical for developing better therapeutics for BM. Recently, we found that microglia, which
are myeloid-derived innate immune cells in the brain, were activated upon BM cell extravasation into the brain
parenchyma. Further, Lag3 on microglia binds to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II on BM cancer
cells, and this interaction inhibits early-stage BM outgrowth. Interestingly, MHC-II is severely downregulated in
human and mice BMs compared to their primary tumors. MHC-II genes are known to be silenced by epigenetic
modifications in cancer cells, e.g., EZH2-induced 3meK27H3, or increased histone deacetylase (HDAC) function.
Indeed, knockout EZH2 in cancer cells increased BM cell surface MHC-II molecules and decreased BM growth
in mice; and treating cancer cells with clinically-applicable EZH2- and/or HDAC-inhibitors increased MHC-II
expression. These findings led us to hypothesize that MHC-II on BM cells and Lag3 on microglia dynamically
interact to control early-stage BM outgrowth, and restoring MHC-II expression in BM using epigenetic drugs may
boost brain innate immune responses and provide novel strategies to treat BM. We will test our hypothesis by
interrogating how microglia, a unique innate immune component in the brain, interact with BM tumor cells along
the temporo-spatial progression of BM. Also, early-stage BM biology is severely understudied, since most
surgically resected patients’ BMs are late-stage lesions. We will explore the interaction between BM and the
unique brain environment during BM development and discover novel biological determinants that are critical for
early-stage BM using enhanced MRI imaging to precisely locate early stage BM lesions, and by spatial gene
expression profiling (Aim 1). To uncover mechanisms that boost the innate immune response in early stage BM,
we will assess how the tumoral MHC-II/microglial Lag3 interaction functionally controls BM outgrowth and we
will elucidate the epigenetic regulation of MHC-II expression in BM cells (Aim 2). Lastly, we will test whether
therapeutically increasing MHC-II with clinically-applicable epigenetic drugs boosts immunity and inhibits BM in
preclinical models and test the potential synergy of combining epigenetic modulators with existing immune
checkpoint therapies (Aim 3). In summary, our proposed studies focus on revealing the dynamic interactions and
crosstalk of BM cells with the innate immune compartment within the brain and developing novel early
intervention and therapeutic strategies using epigenetic drugs to enhance the immune response and treat BMs."

Childhood maltreatment is the most important risk factor for substance use, with maltreatment and household
dysfunction accounting for about two thirds of the population attributable risk for drug dependence and iv drug
use. Hence, there is a substantial subset of individuals with substance use disorders who experienced
maltreatment and a substantial subset who did not. Those with maltreatment tend to have an earlier age of onset,
more severe course, more comorbid symptoms, higher rates of relapse following treatments, and are more likely
to have abnormalities in brain morphology. A critical question is whether the maltreated ecophenotypic variant
is a distinctly different disorder or simply a more severe manifestation of the same underlying disorder. Our
previous efforts during the first ten years of this award resulted in important new discoveries regarding type and
timing of maltreatment, gender differences, predisposing symptoms and specific brain changes that were
prospectively predictive of risk for developing substance use problems in maltreated youths. Our goal during this
phase of the award is to compare maltreated and non-maltreated individuals with histories of “hard drug”
substance use disorders, with opioids as primary drug of abuse, as well as unexposed non-substance using
controls, to provide the first comprehensive test of the ecophenotype hypothesis that there are unique maltreated
and non-maltreated substance use disorder subtypes with distinctly different molecular and neurobiological
signatures. We further propose that neurobiological alterations associated with attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder serve as the primary risk factor in the non-maltreated subtype rather than brain changes associated
with early life stress and maltreatment. Verifying that there are two distinctly different pathways to substance
use disorders would have critically important implications for prevention, treatment and design of future
research studies, as each pathway may require distinctly different strategies for prevention, treatment and
discovery. The second aim of the award will be to determine how exposure to maltreatment during sensitive
periods becomes biologically embedded and to specifically determine how much inflammation and sleep stage
disruption mediate the effects of maltreatment on brain morphometry, brain network architecture and
symptoms predisposing to substance use. The purpose of this aim is to identify the most important mediators as
potential therapeutic targets to prevent the emergence of substance use disorders in high-risk maltreated youth.
Further, ongoing effects of inflammation and sleep disruption on neurobiology and behavior may serve as a
barrier to recovery and targeting these mediators in maltreated individuals with opioid and other substance use
disorders may facilitate recovery. Hence, one aim of this award is to markedly advance our understanding of
substance use by testing the hypothesis that maltreatment and ADHD are not just risk factors for substance use
disorder but distinctly different pathways, while the second aim is to discover potential therapeutic targets to
prevent emergence of substance use and to facilitate recovery."

The regulation of the number and composition of AMPA receptors is a critical feature in maintaining brain
function. AMPA receptor regulation has been implicated in numerous brain disorders including drug addiction, a
disorder that affects more than 20 million patients in the US alone. AMPA receptors are glutamate-gated ion
channels, responsible for the process of learning and memory, and dysregulation can lead to reinforcement of
additive behaviors. AMPA receptors are associated with diverse auxiliary subunits. These auxiliary subunits
regulate both AMPA receptor functional activity expression at synapses. Mechanisms of how auxiliary subunits
regulate AMPA receptor expression are poorly understood. I have preliminary data indicating that a class of
auxiliary subunits, called cornichon homologs, regulate AMPA receptor assembly, specifically the transition from
receptor dimers into functional tetramers (Aim 1). I will evaluate human AMPA receptor variants associated with
neurodevelopmental disorders that potentially disrupt auxiliary subunit interactions and affect receptor assembly
(Aim 2). To evaluate receptor biogenesis and trafficking, I will take a novel approach by dual tagging AMPA
receptors and their auxiliary subunits to identify intracellular changes. I will also measure changes to synaptic
transmission and plasticity due to loss of AMPA receptor - auxiliary subunit interactions. Results from these aims
will provide insights into the intracellular processing of AMPA receptors and potential avenues for therapeutic
targets. The knowledge I gain in neurobiology and acquired techniques from the F99 Phase will be essential for
my transition into a postdoctoral position in neuroscience. For the K00 Phase, I plan to pursue training in a
laboratory focused on in vivo electrophysiology and imaging to investigate the process of drug addiction in rodent
models (Aim 3). The ultimate goal of this proposal is to learn innovative techniques to investigate changes at the
molecular and organismal level and to develop the expertise and independence to become an neuroscientist."
10897299,"Microtubule targeting agents (MTAs) are commonly prescribed to treat many types of cancers; yet their use for

(MOA). Our recent results show that ST-compounds pass the blood brain barrier (BBB) and exhibits in vivo
therapeutic efficacy in a preclinical mouse model of GBM.
 This new R01 uses complementary expertise and approaches to study how the novel MOA of ST-
compounds differs from known MTAs and its therapeutic efficacy in several preclinical mouse model of GBM.
Specifically, it leverages several innovative technologies, including live-cell imaging and artificial learning
algorithms, to better understand why GBM are particularly sensitive to the antitumor activity of ST-compounds.
Experiments will be performed on patient-derived GBM (PD-GBM) in culture and include measure of real-time
changes in GBM cell migration, cell division and cell cycle fate as fundamental readouts of tumorigenesis. In
vivo experiments will be done on both genetic orthotopic mouse models of GBM and orthotopic mouse model
of PD-GBM. Our aims are:
1: Differential impact of MTAs on the migration and mitosis of GBM in culture.
2: Differential impact of MTAs on the viability and fate of GBM in culture.
3: Therapeutic efficacy and mechanism of ST-401 in GBM models in vivo.
Our immediate goal is to increase our understanding of the precise MOA by which MTAs regulate GBM
tumorigenesis and how this interacts with standard care treatments. This work will help set a solid foundation
for the development of a new class of MTAs for the safe treatment of patients diagnosed with GBM."

 The dysfunction and death of pancreatic β cells are key features in all types of diabetes. It was recently
shown that increased proinsulin misfolding occurs well before the onset of diabetes and is responsible for
events, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to β-cell dysfunction and death in diabetes. There
is currently no interventional means that suppresses proinsulin misfolding. In our preliminary studies, we
identified a small molecule (named as PTTD) that protects β-cells from ER stress-induced death in a high-
throughput screen. We discovered that PTTD suppressed the ER stress-induced activation of all three
branches (IRE1, PERK, and ATF6) of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in β-cells under ER stress.
We then observed that PTTD eliminated the accumulation of misfolded proinsulin while increasing mature
insulin production in β-cells and that PTTD suppressed purified insulin protein misfolding/aggregation in cell-
free biochemical assays. Importantly, in in vivo animal studies, PTTD significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia
in multiple mouse diabetes models of β-cell failure. These exciting results demonstrate that suppression of
proinsulin misfolding by PTTD protects β-cells and ameliorates diabetes. In this application, we will use PTTD
as the starting molecule to develop potent analogs as first-in-class proinsulin misfolding inhibitors. To achieve
this, we will use an approach that integrates iterative and parallel medicinal chemistry with in vitro and in vivo
efficacy and DMPK studies with specific aims. In Aim 1, we will improve and optimize our lead compound,
PTTD, through medicinal chemistry-based structure-activity relationship studies. In Aim 2, compounds with
improved potency will be characterized physicochemically and pharmacologically using standardized ADMET
and in vivo PK assays. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the in vivo efficacy of lead PTTD analogs in two well-
established diabetes models of proinsulin misfolding and progressive β cell loss. Completion of this work will
not only identify PTTD and its analogs as first-in-class chemical suppressors of proinsulin misfolding for β-cell
protection, but also establish the suppression of proinsulin misfolding as a new therapeutic direction for
diabetes, which will serve as a foundation and provide a lead compound that may guide further development of
proinsulin folding therapeutics."

Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is among the leading causes of death in AIDS-related opportunistic
infections and causes 15% of AIDS-related mortality globally. In Uganda, CM accounts for 60% of adult
meningitis in hospitalized patients. Even with treatment, the current mortality rate for CM is 65%, with
surviving patients often exhibiting neurological impairment. This poor survival is due to a complex
interaction between 1) failure to control fungal replication and 2) deleterious host immune response. To
reduce CM deaths, we must simultaneously mitigate Cryptococcus virulence while rebalancing
detrimental host responses towards protective immunity. The long-term objective of our research team
is to identify novel treatment strategies for CM that reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this
devastating disease. Our University of Minnesota, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, and
Makerere University research team has collaborated on CM clinical studies since 2009 – including three
NIH-funded trials. While similar clinical infrastructures are now present throughout Africa, there is still
limited ability to perform associated basic and translational research related to CM. Thus, we will
continue to build the infrastructure, knowledge base, and human capacity among African investigators
to perform basic research in genomics and immunology that is translatable to clinical practice.
Our research group has made two key discoveries that influence patient mortality with CM: a) an
immune signature associated with patient mortality, and b) that Cryptococcus genotype affects both
patient mortality and immune response. Specifically, our preliminary genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) identified 38 Cryptococcus genes associated with immune response and patient mortality in
closely related Ugandan CM patient isolates. Thus, the scientific objective for this proposal is to define
the impact of these Cryptococcus biomarkers on the immune response, and validate a subset of the
biomarkers in a mouse model of cryptococcosis. Two specific aims will accomplish this goal. In the first
aim, we will identify genomic differences and biomarkers in Cryptococcus isolates that influence patient
mortality and neurocognitive deficits after CM that encompass the genetic diversity present in Uganda.
We will then analyze associations between these genetic differences and patient immune responses in
the second aim to define both fungal genetic and human immune biomarkers that can be used in clinical
practice as the first step towards development of a diagnostic bioassay. Taken together, these
translational studies will define the molecular processes underlying CM and translate this information
(i.e. biomarkers) into novel clinical assays to identify high-risk individuals for acute mortality or
neurological impairment who would benefit from tailored medical care."
10896936,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Primary metabolic pathways in cancer are useful targets for therapeutic intervention. However, intratumoral
heterogeneity in cancer metabolism is a major challenge for anti-cancer therapy. Reducing metabolic variance
by reprogramming cancer metabolism is essential to enhance efficacy of inhibitors targeting metabolism. Our
long-term goal is to overcome metabolic heterogeneity through reprogramming metabolic networks to increase
the number of cancer cells vulnerable to metabolic inhibitors. To reach this goal, our novel strategy is to reduce
metabolic variance among cancer cells by targeting BACH1, a master regulator of metabolism-related
transcription in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), to obtain maximal response of drugs targeting metabolic
pathways. Our previous molecular and metabolomic profiling of breast tumors revealed that BACH1 suppresses
mitochondrial metabolism. Thus, BACH1 depletion made TNBC cells more sensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors.
These findings led to the novel concept that BACH1 depletion increases the proportion of cancer cells with higher
dependency on mitochondrial respiration and restricted tumor metabolic plasticity. Our preliminary studies
indicate that BACH1 also suppresses lactate catabolism, which is a primary pathway for lactate oxidation in
mitochondria of cancer cells. In support of this finding, recent clinical studies showed that lactate catabolism
depends on lactate transporter (MCT1). In TNBC cells, BACH1 represses transcription of genes that encode
enzymes involved in lactate catabolism, including lactate transporter (MCT1), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB),
and mitochondrial pyruvate carriers. Specifically, BACH1 depletion sensitized cancer cells to blockade of MCT1
or LDHB. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that BACH1 is the key determinant of whether cancer
cells produce lactate or consume lactate. The primary objective of this proposed study is to link BACH1
contribution to lactate catabolic variance, and to better understand regulation of lactate oxidation in TNBC. Using
multiple innovative approaches, including in vitro and in vivo breast tumor models and a combination of
transcriptomics and metabolomics, we will interrogate BACH1 regulation of lactate catabolism and define the
underlying molecular regulatory mechanism in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, using patient-derived xenograft
and syngeneic mouse models, we will investigate whether BACH1 inhibition (through the repurposed non-toxic
FDA-approved drug, panhematin) increases breast tumor vulnerability to drugs targeting the lactate transporter
MCT1. By combining cell biology and in vivo assays, this study will provide comprehensive insights into how
cancer cells use lactate as a substrate, whether metabolic variances are reduced by targeting BACH1, and how
to achieve better therapeutic strategies using lactate catabolism inhibitors."

deaths that occur each year from failures of finding viable kidney matches for transplant, to reduce the nearly 4-
year time on donor waitlists, and to reduce the number of failed transplants. The current process for screening
deceased donor kidneys uses two methods: 1) pathological scores based on anatomical features from a biopsy
(tubules, glomeruli, etc.) and 2) the Kidney Donor Profile Index (KDPI) derived from the donor’s medical history
(hypertension, diabetes, weight, etc.). However, clinical research indicates that those current methods have
limited discriminative power. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an imaging technology that can obtain
high-resolution, non-invasive, cross-sectional images of biological tissues in situ and in real time. We have
demonstrated that OCT can provide non-invasive, real-time, histopathological information of the kidney that is
impossible to obtain using any other known procedure. We have demonstrated that OCT imaging of human
kidney histopathology both prior to and following their transplant can be used to predict post-transplant renal
function. Furthermore, these preliminary trials have demonstrated that OCT imaging of human donor kidneys
with a hand-held unit in the operating room is safe and that the entire kidney can be evaluated within a relatively
short period of time. From a recently finished clinical study with 169 human transplant kidneys, we found that in
the expanded criteria donor (ECD) kidneys (or marginal kidneys), increased tubular lumen diameter was able to
predict delayed graft function (DGF) prior to implantation. In this proposal, we will develop a novel OCT device
with intelligent scanning and deep learning to evaluate donor kidney viability before transplant. By scanning the
whole kidney surface, our device intends to eliminate the uncertainty created by the biopsy/KDPI paradigm. The
OCT imaging studies will be correlated with post-transplant renal function in order to establish imaging algorithms
and guidelines for OCT imaging of kidneys prior to their transplant. Our central hypothesis is that more
comprehensive morphological parameters as measured by OCT can be used to determine post-transplantation
renal function. The specific aims of this proposal are: 1) Develop robot-assisted automatic 3D scanning OCT
imaging device to image human kidneys prior to their transplantation. 2) Develop deep-learning-based image
processing algorithms to quantitatively assess the OCT parameters as indicators of the functional status of
kidneys, using histology scoring system as the gold standard. 3) Derive the diagnostic criteria for assessing
transplant kidney function and perform prospective clinical studies to assess the accuracy of predicting post-
transplant function using OCT."

A significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) in lifetime smokers harbor somatic mutations in the
KRAS oncogene (KM-LUADs). Due to enhanced screening, KM-LUAD is increasingly being detected at earlier
pathological stages, thus posing a growing public health burden that warrants improved early treatment.
Despite this urgency, early changes that conceive KM-LUAD and that would thus likely comprise ideal targets
for interception remain poorly characterized. Previously, our group and others have shown that tobacco
exposure leads to a pervasive field of injury that is composed of molecular (e.g., KRAS mutations) and
inflammatory changes in normal-appearing epithelium and in the lung, and that are prevalent in the LUADs
themselves. We and others have also previously described molecular and immune changes, including a
decrement in host immunity, that are associated with development of lung premalignant lesions (PMLs) and
KM-LUAD. These earlier studies have shed light on events that are likely implicated in early lung tumor
development. Yet, especially for a cancer like KM-LUAD that is causally related to smoking, the identity and
properties of specific cell populations that trigger a field of injury as well as its progression to PML and KM-
LUAD are not known. In our preliminary efforts, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of lung tissues from
a human-relevant mouse model of tobacco-associated KM-LUAD. We found a population of Krt8+ alveolar
cells (KACs) that was greatly increased early on in lungs exposed to tobacco carcinogen but not control saline
and that were also associated with tumor cell onset. KACs displayed intriguing properties that allow us to
surmise that they perhaps represent KM-LUAD progenitors: they amassed the same driver Kras mutations
found in the resultant LUADs; they expressed transcriptomic programs and cell-cell interactions that are highly
pertinent to KM-LUAD including augmented p53 as well as pro-inflammatory IL-1β and NF-κB signaling; and
their expression profiles were highly enriched in human PMLs and LUADs. We also found that KACs were
markedly increased in the human LUAD ecosystem relative to matched normal lung. Our preliminary findings
motivate the hypothesis that oncogenesis of KACs in concert with pro-inflammatory signaling mediated
by IL-1β/NF-κB underlie initiation and development of PML and KM-LUAD. To address our hypothesis we
will 1) characterize at single-cell resolution evolution of KACs to PML and KM-LUAD, as well as determine the
role of p53 signaling in this process; 2) discern the role of pro-inflammatory signaling in promoting evolution of
KACs to PML and KM-LUAD; and 3) use multiple approaches including drug screening to determine whether
targeting KACs will intercept PML and KM-LUAD development. At the conclusion of our studies, we will have
unraveled novel paths in the phenotypic evolution of KM-LUAD as well as laid the foundation for development
of new strategies that inhibit the inception of this dire malignancy."

 2 This career development project will provide a path for a highly qualified candidate with a combined MD/PhD
 3 degree into a career as an independent investigator in reproductive science. Female infertility due to disorders
 4 of androgen excess or insufficiency is a growing problem in the U.S. and worldwide with high mental and financial
 5 costs. Androgen imbalance is implicated in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and diminished ovarian reserve
 6 (DOR); however, while the phenotypic effects of androgen activity in the ovary are significant, little is known
 7 about the underlying molecular pathways. This proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms of androgen actions
 8 in ovarian follicle growth and atresia, which are disordered in PCOS and DOR. The research direction stems
 9 from the recent finding by the candidate that the androgen-regulated mRNA transcriptome in ovarian granulosa
10 cells is surprisingly small, and focuses on non-coding RNA regulation by androgens in granulosa cells. The
11 proposal also builds on prior studies of paxillin as a mediator of androgen signaling in prostate cancer. The role
12 of paxillin as a regulator of the androgen receptor expression is assessed for the first time in granulosa cells in
13 this proposal. The effects of paxillin loss in granulosa cells on follicular development and fertility will be examined
14 in a granulosa cell-specific knockout mouse model. The molecular mechanisms involving microRNA regulation
15 by androgens in granulosa cells will be studied in cultured mouse and human cells. The hypothesis is that
16 androgen effects in granulosa cells are mediated in large part by microRNAs, and are enhanced by paxillin. The
17 project has the potential to suggest novel therapeutic avenues for PCOS, a disease with sub-optimal
18 management options. The training plan capitalizes on the applicant’s strong research background and long-
19 standing interest in female fertility. She aims to build on her technical skills, develop as a leader and a member
20 of the scientific community, and transition to independence in research. The mentor is a physician-scientist who
21 is a world expert in paxillin and androgen signaling, mouse genetics and ovarian biology with a long track record
22 of mentoring successful trainees. The training will take place in a highly collaborative environment where
23 expertise in reproductive research techniques is abundant. The applicant has assembled an advisory committee
24 comprised of world experts in ovarian biology, paxillin, steroid signaling, and microRNA sequencing. She will
25 take advantage of University-sponsored courses in translational research methods, leadership and professional
26 development, as well as research seminars, national meetings and one-on-one instruction. At the end of this
27 project, she plans to write several first-author publications, run a lab independently, mentor a graduate student
28 and apply for an R-01 grant."
10897089,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common but poorly understood condition that
predisposes asymptomatic individuals to leukemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is associated with
increased mortality. A recently-discovered condition, CHIP is characterized by the acquisition of age-
associated somatic mutations that promote the expansion of specific blood cell populations, or clones, in a
process called clonal hematopoiesis (CH). While CHIP-associated mutations, such as mutations in the
epigenetic regulator Tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), are frequently observed in leukemia,
individuals with CHIP are at an even greater risk of CVD, including coronary heart disease and early-onset
myocardial infarction, and the mechanisms underlying these cardiovascular manifestations are not well
understood. While loss of Tet2 in hematopoietic cells accelerates atherosclerosis via the secretion of
interleukin-1 (IL-1β) from pro-inflammatory macrophages, inhibition of IL-1 signaling only partially prevents
atherosclerotic plaque formation, suggesting that additional inflammatory pathways contribute to this
pathology. Indeed, our group has demonstrated that hyperactivation of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and
downstream pro-inflammatory transcription factors promote CH and that a feedforward loop involving these
pathways in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) propagates CH. However, it is not yet know if
these pathways contribute to CHIP-associated CVD and if HSPCs play a direct role in this context.
We hypothesize that the complex inflammatory response in Tet2-deficient CHIP-associated CVD relies on a
pro-inflammatory feedforward loop between HSPCs and multiple mature hematopoietic lineages mediated by
IL-1β, IL-6, and MYD88 signaling and that suppression of established CVD requires downstream inhibition of
these pathways. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) to interrogate the
inflammatory pathways underlying CHIP-associated CVD and (2) to investigate whether HSPCs and mature
myeloid lineages contribute to a pro-inflammatory feedforward loop in CHIP-associated CVD. The objective of
this fellowship is to determine the inflammatory signaling pathways and hematopoietic lineages underlying
CHIP-associated CVD and to investigate their feasibility as therapeutic targets. To address these aims, genetic
and pharmacologic approaches will be used to dissect the contributions of these pathways and cell types.
Innovative techniques, including single cell-RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and ultrasound, will be employed
to elucidate the cell-type heterogeneity of CHIP and to monitor translationally-relevant indicators of disease
progression and therapeutic response. The significance of this proposal is the identification of potential
therapies for established CHIP-associated CVD. As patients with CHIP often present with established CVD, a
better understanding of these pathways and the development of therapeutic agents that can effectively
ameliorate established CVD would significantly improve the clinical care of these patients."

Over the past 23 years, we have conducted the first-ever randomized controlled trial (RCT) of foster care as an
alternative to institutional care for young children, the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP). We now
propose in this supplement application support for our staff to finalize data collection on the Bucharest sample.
The assessments will provide novel and important data regarding the transition to adulthood and allow us to
answer timely questions about the possibility that adolescence is a second period of marked sensitivity to
environmental influences and neural reorganization during which positive caregiving experiences may mitigate,
at least in part, the negative effects of early adversity on cognitive, emotional, and neurobiological processes
as well as psychopathology. The proposed analyses will make use of the intensive repeated assessments that
have occurred beginning when participants were infants and toddles still living in institutions, following them
after randomization to care as usual or foster care placement through childhood and adolescence. The
longitudinal design is unique in measuring multiple constructs over time spanning early, middle, and late
childhood, as well as the pre-pubertal period and the transition to adolescence. This allows us to examine
whether domains of development that were unaffected by the early intervention (e.g., Cognitive Control) may
improve during adolescence among children in stable caregiving placements, as well as whether additional
improvements occur in domains that were positively influenced by the intervention, but where children
continued to show difficulties compared to typically developing children (e.g., Reward Responsiveness). These
questions will be examined not only using behavioral data, but also in several neurobiological domains that no
prior study of early adversity has assessed over such a long period. This includes EEG, ERP, MRI, and DTI
data in the neuroimaging domain, as well as comprehensive measures of cognitive, social, and emotional
functioning at every time point. Our unique data allow us to evaluate whether specific domains of cognitive,
emotional, and neurobiological development “recover” or “catch-up” for children who experienced severe early
deprivation followed by stable caregiving in adolescence. We will also assess the effects of early adversity and
positive caregiving experiences on the emergence of developmentally appropriate competencies during young
adulthood. Determining the relevance of adolescent caregiving experiences in shaping psychopathology in
emerging adulthood is essential to designing interventions that have the potential to buffer the effects of early
adversity in the US and worldwide."

 Bioprinting plant virus nanoparticles for immunotherapy and relapse prevention of ovarian cancer
High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most common and severe form of ovarian cancer and women
with HGSOC have a poor prognosis. Immunotherapy approaches that induce systemic antitumor immunity, in
particular those that prevent relapse, are urgently needed for HGSOC. We propose to employ plant virus-like
nanoparticles (VLPs) combined with slow release antigen depots as a cancer vaccine approach to launch sys-
temic antitumor immunity during remission to block relapse. Our data indicate that intraperitoneal (IP) admin-
istration of plant VLPs in a mouse model of ovarian cancer modulates the tumor microenvironment to relieve
immunosuppression and generate adaptive anti-tumor immunity and memory against tumor antigens. The VLPs
are non-infectious, non-cytotoxic, and non-cytolytic, but the highly repetitive nature of the proteinaceous VLPs
triggers innate immune activation and associated adaptive immune response. Building on this, we will develop
a VLP biopolymer formulation to enable effective immunotherapy following surgical debulking in HGSOC. We
will incorporate irradiated tumor cells as source for patient specific tumor antigens; the cells will be delivered
together with the VLPs which act as adjuvant to launch long-lasting anti-tumor immunity. The proposed immu-
notherapy implant will be produced through an innovative 3D bioprinting technique; specifically, rapid, microscale
continuous optical bioprinting (µCOB). This platform offers control over both the topographical complexity and
the cellular and material composition of the scaffold at micron-level resolution. Our rapid 3D bioprinting process
allows for photopolymerization of multiple biocompatible materials, and facilitates incorporation of VLPs and/or
cells. The engineering design space and tunability of this approach is impeccable; in particular the implant will
be designed so that therapeutic doses are released in programmed intervals (prime/boost) vs. continuous slow
release. We will fulfill three specific aims: 1) Bioprint VLP biopolymer implants and test various configurations to
optimize slow, continuous release vs. staged, e.g. weekly release of the therapeutic VLPs. The implants will
undergo rigorous quality control and reproducibility testing and released VLPs will undergo structural analysis
and biological testing. 2) Evaluate efficacy of the immunotherapy implants vs. soluble VLPs will be evaluated
using mouse model of ovarian cancer (ID8vegf/defb29). Immunological investigation will provide insights into the
mechanism of the immunotherapy. 3) To further explore vaccine parameters and model very low endogenous
patient antigen loads during remission, we will bioprint biopolymer implants to deliver VLPs and antigen (from
irradiated cells) prior to challenge with ID8vegf/defb29 cells. For future translational approaches, patient tumor
from surgical debulking and/or patient neoantigen peptides would be used. The clinical significance is high: we
envision a simple modification to the current treatment work-flow, where small degradable vaccine implants are
left in the intraperitoneal (IP) cavity during surgery or administered subcutaneously (SC) post-surgery, or both."

Cardiac conditions are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Over 400 million people are living
with cardiac conditions, and 18 million people die annually. In the U.S., coronary heart disease affects 18.2
million adults and heart failure affects over 6.5 million people, of whom over 30% are hospitalized for acute
exacerbations annually. Patient-reported outcomes provide healthcare professionals and patients with insight
into where patients are on the disease trajectory, both during routine management and during recovery from a
major clinical event. The overall goal of the Improve the Meaning of Patient-Reported Outcomes to eValuate
Effectiveness for Cardiac Care” (IMPROVE: Cardiac Care) study is to establish population and individual
minimally clinically important differences (MCIDS), which are the smallest improvement that is meaningful to
patients with cardiac conditions. In Aim 1, the investigators will establish MCIDs in patient-reported outcomes
for patients with coronary heart disease recovering from coronary artery bypass surgery, or with heart failure
recovering from a hospitalization. In Aim 2, the investigators will establish MCIDs in patient-reported outcomes
for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction undergoing disease management in the ambulatory
setting. For both Aims 1 and 2, we will use three statistical approaches including: 1) anchor-based methods
(associated changes in PROs and clinical indicators, mean changes, receiver operating characteristics), and 2)
conditional anchor-based methods (using multivariate logistic regression). In Aim 3, investigators will determine
how patient-reported outcomes from patients with cardiac condition can inform clinical decision-making. Guided
by the Data-Frame Theory of Sensemaking, we will evaluate 60 patient and healthcare professional dyads
making clinical decisions using patient-reported outcome health information with: 1) video ethnography to
measure communication behaviors; and 2) reflexive interviewing based on videoed clinical encounters to
describe how patient-reported outcomes are incorporated into the sensemaking process. Overall, the IMPROVE:
Cardiac Care study will establish minimally clinically important differences that can be used to identify patients
who are not optimally recovering from a cardiac event, and use the MCIDs to target early interventions. The
investigators will also develop a novel framework for how patient-reported outcomes can be meaningfully
incorporated into clinical practice."

Even transient developmental hearing loss (HL) can cause lasting deficits to auditory perception, affecting
speech and language acquisition and subsequent educational attainment for many children. Although research
suggests that developmental HL can impair temporal processing (e.g., amplitude modulation processing), there
is evidence that impairments to the perception of the spectral content are closely correlated with speech
comprehension. Furthermore, there is evidence that these deficits are due, in part, to a long-lasting reduction in
the strength of inhibitory synapses in auditory cortex (AC). Therefore, the goals of this proposal are to assess
the impact of developmental HL on a spectral modulation (SM) detection task in gerbils and to identify a causal
relationship between perceptual deficits and reductions in GABAB receptor-mediated inhibition in AC. The core
hypothesis of this proposal is that developmental HL will cause a reduction in the function of postsynaptic
GABAB receptors, thereby impairing AC encoding of spectrally modulated stimuli and leading to SM detection
deficits. Two aims test predictions emerging from this hypothesis: Aim 1A will determine the influence of
developmental hearing loss on detection of SM stimuli. Gerbils will be reared with bilateral earplugs from P11-
23, a time when AC inhibition is particularly vulnerable. Twelve days after earplug removal, animals will be tested
on a SM detection task. SM thresholds will be obtained across 10 days so that perceptual learning and
asymptotic performance can be compared between control and HL-reared animals. Aim 1B will determine
whether developmental HL impairs AC neuron encoding of SM stimuli using an awake-behaving preparation.
AC will be implanted with an electrode array and recordings will be acquired during SM task performance. Neural
sensitivity to a range of modulation depths will be measured between normal hearing and HL animals. Aim 2 will
test the prediction that reduced functional GABAB receptors in AC contribute to impaired perception of SM after
developmental HL. Using a novel AAV vector to express a gerbil-specific GABAB receptor subunit (Gabrb1b)
obtained from the recently sequenced gerbil genome in AC after developmental HL. The AAV-Gabrb1b vector
will be injected bilaterally into AC after earplug removal. Behavioral testing will then be performed to determine
whether normal SM detection thresholds are restored. Together, these aims will advance our understanding of
the neural mechanisms underlying perceptual deficits attending developmental HL and identify a path towards
developing the first pharmaceutical treatments for its lasting consequences."

We have recently found that patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) have a dampened response to the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and this leads to persistent production of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα. In a murine Jak2V617F MPN model, pharmacologic blockade of IL-10R signaling enhances the selective advantage of Jak2V617F mutant cells. The objective of this project is to define how JAK2V617F mutant HSC gain a selective advantage over wild-type (WT) HSC when IL-10R is blocked. Our central hypothesis is that dampened IL-10R signaling creates an inflammatory state that negatively affects WT but not JAK2V617F mutant HSC, thus endowing JAK2V617F mutant cells a selective advantage. Moreover, we hypothesize that dampened IL-10R signaling is an intrinsic feature of those predisposed to acquire MPN. In Aim 1 we will determine the prevalence of an IL-10 resistance phenotype among MPN families. We have found that MPN patients display an inability to respond to IL-10, which we term the “IL-10 resistance phenotype”. However, cases with a family history of MPN have not been systematically evaluated for the phenotype, nor have unaffected family members. We will determine the prevalence of the IL-10 resistance phenotype in affected and unaffected members of our growing MPN family registry which currently contains 53 MPN families. In Aim 2 we will identify the genetic basis for blunted IL-10R signaling in MPN. We will perform targeted DNA sequencing and gene expression profiling (i.e., RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and differential DNA methylation analysis) to identify the underlying mechanism responsible for dampened IL-10 signaling in MPN. Using sorted peripheral blood monocytes we will use Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC chips to determine if MPN patients and unaffected family members with blunted IL-10 signaling have differential methylation of IL-10R signaling genes. Gene expression profiling will be performed in parallel to determine if the methylation pattern accurately predicts gene expression. We will also perform targeted DNA sequencing, focusing on cytokine receptor pathway genes, and paying close attention to any genes found to have differential methylation and/or expression, to identify the genetic basis for blunted IL-10 signaling in MPN patients."

Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) affects ~3 million people in the U.S. and is a mortal and
morbid disease. HFrEF impairs a patient’s ability to exercise and perform activities of daily living. Although weak
cardiac pumping ability clearly contributes to chronic disability associated with HFrEF, abnormal skeletal muscle
function in patients with HFrEF is also a key debilitating factor. Skeletal muscle is therefore a vital target for
treatment of HFrEF. Dietary inorganic nitrate enhances aerobic exercise capacity and muscle power in patients
with HFrEF, as demonstrated in our preliminary studies. The overarching aim of the proposed clinical trial is to
determine whether inorganic nitrate in a once-a-day oral gelcap format, offers a new, safe, and effective
treatment for ameliorating the impaired exercise performance due to HFrEF.
 The Aim of the R61 component of this grant is to set up the infrastructure necessary for the phase II
clinical trial and to begin the trial. This includes compounding the inorganic nitrate (KNO3)/placebo capsules and
all safety testing, obtaining Institutional Review Board approval, ClinicalTrials.gov registration, REDCap
database development, Recruitment Enhancement Core (REC) engagement, Clinical Translational Research
Unit (CTRU) project approval, enrollment and assessment and dose administration of the first subjects.
 The Aims of the R33 component are to determine the effectiveness of acute (2 hours after a single dose)
and chronic (after 6 weeks of once-a-day dosing) KNO3 treatment (10mmol) vs. placebo on quadriceps muscle
power and on aerobic exercise performance (V̇O2peak) in patients with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction
<45%). We hypothesize that both acute and chronic dosing of 10mmol of KNO3 will improve exercise
performance in HFrEF. To test this hypothesis, we will perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-arm design study. Patients with stable New York Heart Association class I-III HFrEF will undergo
screening and phenotyping before completing baseline peak muscle power and aerobic performance
measurements. On visit 2, subjects will receive a single dose (1 capsule) of their assigned treatment (10mmol
KNO3 or placebo) and will repeat the measurements of exercise performance after 2h. Subjects will then continue
with their assigned treatment (KNO3 or placebo, 1 capsule daily) for 6 weeks. On visit 3, subjects will repeat the
tests of exercise performance. The primary endpoints are maximum quadriceps muscle power, measured using
an isokinetic dynamometer, and aerobic exercise performance, based on V̇O2peak. Max exercise time and max
muscle velocity, tolerability and safety of KNO3 vs. placebo treatment and their effects on hemodynamics, plasma
nitrate, plasma nitrite, breath nitric oxide (NO), and heart failure symptoms (using well-validated questionnaires)
will also be quantified in this phase II, single-center clinical trial. The potential impact of finding a new, safe
and effective treatment that helps millions of patients beat the physical disability of HFrEF is enormous."
10895100,"Mammalian hantaviruses (order Bunyavirales, genus Orthohantavirus) are zoonotic RNA viruses that cause
severe vascular inflammatory disease in humans, with case-fatality rates of up to 40%. These negative-sense,
tri-segmented viruses are maintained, persistently and asymptomatically, within wild rodent and insectivore
reservoir populations worldwide. As the first line of antiviral defense, innate immune signaling and type I
interferon (IFN) act to limit viral replication and production of infectious progeny, preventing tissue dissemination
and systemic infection. A dominant hypothesis posits that asymptomatic reservoir persistence is maintained
through innate immune suppression, which allows for sustained viral replication without damaging inflammation.
Evidence to support this hypothesis includes observations by our group and others that hantavirus infection of
natural reservoir target endothelial cells (EC) results in dampened innate immune signaling and IFN-stimulated
gene (ISG) expression. We now show that EC from the natural reservoir host (Rattus norvegicus) for Seoul virus
(Orthohantavirus seoulense, SEOV) support sustained viral replication and infectious virion production in the
presence of exogenous type I IFN and robust ISG expression. In contrast, the related Hantaan virus is highly
susceptible to IFN-mediated restriction in human and rat EC, both of which represent non-reservoir hosts.
Similarly, SEOV replication in human EC was reduced in the context of type I IFN signaling, either through
exogenous treatment or induced by viral recognition receptors. Together, this led to our overall hypothesis that,
through coevolution, SEOV has developed mechanisms to directly target rat antiviral effector proteins induced
by type I IFN and inhibit their functionality. Our data further suggests that mechanisms of inhibition seen in rat
cells are ineffective in the setting of human infection. The unique tractability of the natural rat host and the distinct
divergence in immune modulation provides an opportunity to identify critical SEOV protein – host antiviral protein
interfaces that prevent viral restriction in reservoir, but not human EC. Our team brings decades of experience
in virology, innate immune signaling, and in identifying human host protein interactors for diverse families of RNA
viruses, as well as all of the necessary reagents, assays, and expertise for success. Using novel monoclonal
antibodies directed at each of the SEOV proteins to capture authentic viral protein complexes in the context of
infection, we will undertake an innovative comparative proteomics approach to contrast the SEOV interactome
in reservoir rat and non-reservoir human primary EC (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we will perform validation and functional
analysis of selected IFN-induced antiviral host partners isolated in Aim 1 to test their significance for viral
replication and progeny production in reservoir and non-reservoir host cells. This approach to identify unique
virus-host interactors is the first described for a reservoir host of any hantavirus species and will yield insights
into mechanisms of persistence and human disease."

 End-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis causes an enormous clinical and economic burden,
affecting over 550,000 Americans and costing ~$49 billion annually. Home dialysis is a preferred treatment for
ESRD, offering better quality of life than in-center hemodialysis at reduced cost. Yet, uptake of home dialysis is
low and there are stark racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in uptake. There is limited understanding of
organizational structures and processes that lead to higher home dialysis uptake and reduced disparities. This
proposal applies rigorous health services research techniques to examine the ESRD Treatment Choices (ETC)

interviews and national large claims databases, this research aims to (1) Identify changes in structures and
processes of care in response to the ETC Model; (2) Identify facility and practice structures and processes of
care associated with home dialysis uptake; and (3) Assess the impact of the ETC Model on socioeconomic and
racial/ethnic disparities in home dialysis uptake. The knowledge gained in this project is highly likely to
influence healthcare policy and the delivery of kidney disease care on the national scale by revealing effective

SNPH is normally expressed only in axons. Surprisingly, under support from a R21, we discovered that SNPH
intrudes into dendrites of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum and causes excitotoxicity in a rodent model (Shiverer)
for Progressive MS (Joshi et al., 2019, Cell Reports, Article In Press 15th October). This discovery suggests
that targeting SNPH to block intrusion into dendrites is a novel treatment for Progressive MS. In this follow-up
RO1, we will address three important questions raised by our R21 discovery highly relevant to the basic
science and clinical aspect of MS. In Aim #1, we will test the hypothesis that the pathology of dendritic SNPH
intrusion in the grey matter is de-coupled from the pathology of white matter. We will test this hypothesis by
showing that curing white matter pathology in the Shiverer model (by genetically suppressing axonal
degeneration and by remyelination therapy) will not prevent the pathology of dendritic SNPH intrusion. In Aim
#2, we will test the hypothesis that dendritic SNPH intrusion causes excitotoxicity by biasing the activation of
NMDA receptors towards the pro-death, extra-synaptic NMDA receptors. In Aim #3, we will test the hypothesis
that the glutamate released by synaptic activity, when it spills over to the extra-synaptic region as exacerbated
by dysfunctional glutamate uptake, constitutes an early glutamate signaling cascade that triggers dendritic
SNPH intrusion.
Conclusion – SNPH is a key protein that controls mitochondrial movement with multi-faceted effects on
neuronal behaviors in health and disease. Since the cloning of SNPH in 2000, the studies of SNPH in neurons
have been exclusively in axons. The Novelty of this RO1 is a paradigm shift to pioneer the study of SNPH in
dendrites. The Translational Significance is the surprising discovery that dendritic SNPH mediates
excitotoxicity in Progressive MS, thereby opening up new insights to treat MS in this incurable late-phase."

 Nutrient mobilization fuels the metabolic activity needed to fight or escape threats and is a critical
component of the central nervous system (CNS) response to stress. While mild stress-induced hyperglycemia
is associated with improved survival in critical illness, severe or chronic responses are associated with
development of diabetes. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a crucial role in coordinating the
response to stress; however, the specific mechanisms and neural circuits by which the brain mediates SNS-
dependent stress responses, including nutrient mobilization, remain poorly understood. Pre-autonomic neurons
in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) modulate SNS outflow to multiple organs and can
mediate a diverse range of responses, including hepatic glucose production, glucose disposal, and energy
expenditure. We have recently identified a subset of VMN neurons (marked by cholecystokinin b receptor (Cckbr)
expression (VMNCCKBR neurons)) that are activated by stressors (including restraint and noxious stimuli) and
mediate glucose and lipid mobilization as well as defensive freezing behaviors, suggesting that VMNCCKBR cells
coordinate multiple responses to specific stressors. Single nucleus RNA-Sequencing (snRNA-Seq) analysis of
the VMN reveals that VMNCCKBR neurons distribute across multiple transcriptionally defined classes of neurons
within the VMN (VMN T-types) and they project to multiple brain regions, including the preoptic area (POA;
involved in metabolism) and the periaqueductal gray (PAG; implicated in the behavioral response to threats).
The goals of this proposal are to define the anatomic neural circuits and functional mechanisms of
VMNCCKBR neuron-mediated nutrient mobilization and to test the hypothesis that VMNCCKBR neurons
mediate metabolic and behavioral stress responses through independent neural pathways. We will
identify the target tissues of VMNCCKBR neurons using optogenetic-stimulated norepinephrine turnover and will
determine the mechanisms through which VMNCCKBR neurons regulate acute hepatic glucose production using
stable isotope fluxomics. We will then assess whether VMNCCKBR-dependent lipid mobilization contributes to
glucose production chronically. To identify which populations of VMNCCKBR neurons regulate nutrient mobilization
versus defensive behaviors, we will use retrograde tracing followed by snRNA-Seq to define clusters that project
to the POA and PAG respectively. We will then use optogenetic activation of VMNCCKBR neuron terminals
projecting to the POA and PAG to establish the functional outputs of these cell classes. This work will define the
anatomic and functional mechanisms driving SNS-dependent stress-mediated nutrient mobilization. Completion
of this project will provide training in liver and white adipose physiology, neuroanatomical tracing, behavioral
phenotyping and genomic bioinformatics, allowing me to become an expert in central nervous system regulation
of glucose homeostasis and providing the tools necessary to transition to an independent career as a physician-
scientist."
10869945,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Over the past two decades, high rates of opioid prescribing have led to widespread
opioid use and epidemic levels of adverse opioid-related outcomes. Early interventions focused on reducing
opioid prescribing through the development of practice guidelines and implementation of programs and policies
to increase prescription opioid management and monitoring. While overall opioid prescribing has declined in
recent years and may have contributed to reductions in prescription opioid-involved overdose death rates in
2012 and 2013, the rate has since risen to a new high, comprising 40% of all opioid-related deaths in 2016.
Furthermore, prescribing remains elevated in disadvantaged groups and areas, highlighting a need to better
understand how individual characteristics intersect with health system and population-level factors in the
pathways from opioid use to fatal and non-fatal overdose. Using a multi-level approach, the proposed project
examines trajectories from opioid treatment for chronic non-cancer pain to opioid overdose and fatality,
accounting for: 1) individual sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (e.g. sex, age, race/ethnicity,
comorbidities), 2) opioid treatment patterns (e.g. dosage, duration, formulation), 3) county-level health system
(e.g. facilities, services) and population characteristics (e.g. percent poverty, minority, unemployed, disabled),
and 4) state-level policies (e.g. Medicaid policies, Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs). Opioid treatment
patterns will be assessed using national Medicaid Analytic Extract (MAX) data, adjusting for individual
characteristics. Risk of overdose based on individual characteristics and treatment patterns will be assessed
using MAX data for medically treated non-fatal opioid overdose and National Death Index (NDI) data for fatal
opioid overdose. Overdose outcomes will be further assessed using county-level Area Health Resource File
(AHRF) data and state-level policy measures. Contextualizing individual outcomes within wider health care
systems and social and geographic settings supports NIDA’s strategic plan to increase the public health impact
of research. Additional substantive and methodological training will contribute to the applicant’s long-term goal
to develop an independent academic research career and generate and disseminate robust evidence to inform
effective interventions to reduce opioid-related morbidity and mortality. The training aims include advanced
study and application of: 1) innovative methods to characterize clinical care patterns over time, 2) social and
spatial epidemiology theory and methods to study multilevel influences on health, 3) policy drivers of health
and health care, and 4) professional development for conducting ethical, independent research. The research
and training are supported by an interdisciplinary mentorship team of Columbia University researchers with
expertise in substance use and policy research, clinical and spatial epidemiology, and statistics with additional
support from external collaborators in health services and policy research methods. This project and career
development plan will prepare the applicant to secure R01 funding to extend this line of research."
10870040,"Project Summary / Abstract
The Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) recently published a “roadmap” for the types of medicines that are
needed to support the long-term goal of malaria elimination and eradication. The roadmap consists of a wish list
of target candidate profiles (TCP) and medicines (target product profiles, i.e., TPP). With the most recent revision
to the anti-malarial target candidates and product profiles the MMV highlighted the need for identifying new rapid
acting medicines for active case management while other drugs are needed for chemo-protection and chemo-
prevention with long-acting molecules, and/or parenteral formulations (i.e., TCP-2) (Burrows, JN et al., 2017,
Malaria Journal, 16:26). According to their updated roadmap new drugs are needed to protect populations
entering areas of high endemicity during the final stages of malaria elimination. And drugs with causal liver-
stage activity are needed for chemoprevention to prevent infection or outbreak of resistance during malarial
seasons. This TCP has been modeled on the combination drug atovaquone + proguanil.
As a potent and selective inhibitor of the parasite’s cytochrome bc1 complex ELQ-300 selectively targets
Plasmodium falciparum in the blood and liver stages and even kills parasites developing in the midgut of the
mosquito vector. Unlike atovaquone, ELQ-300 is a selective inhibitor of the Qi site of the target enzyme complex.
With support from the NIH and US DOD we have been successful in developing an oral formulation of prodrug
ELQ-331 for use in humans for weekly prophylaxis against malaria. In the present application we seek NIH
support for work to develop ELQ derivatives that more effectively and comprehensively inhibit the parasite
cytochrome bc1 complex. Advanced designs for improved ELQ constructs are supported by preliminary data
provided with the application as well as our extensive knowledge of Endochin-Like Quinolone derivatives as
inhibitors of the Plasmodium falciparum cytochrome bc1 Qo or Qi sites. Superior molecules will advance through
a down-selection test cascade for assessment of selective potency and lack of mammalian cytotoxicity,
metabolic stability, solubility in simulated intestinal fluids, resistance propensity and mode of action as well as
efficacy against blood and liver stage malaria in mice. Prodrugs of superior molecules will be explored to assess
for enhancement of oral bioavailability and antimalarial performance over parent molecules."
10897107,"Shaping the Indications for Periodontal Adjunctive Antibiotics in dental practice: A PBRN Clinical Trial
Periodontitis is a bacterial inflammatory disease that has been reported to affect nearly 40% of Americans
aged 30 years or older. If left untreated, periodontitis can lead to tooth loss and patient-perceived morbidity.
Historically, antibiotic use has been an integral part of periodontal disease treatment. However, antibiotic
stewardship calls for rationalizing their prescription to reduce antibiotic misuse and development of resistant
strains. Across medical disciplines, there is a clear direction to identify individuals who in fact may benefit
from antibiotic use and to provide guidelines for their use. As of 2018, the American Dental Association has
developed evidence-based guidelines limiting circumstances for prophylactic antibiotic use in dental
practice; however, no national guidelines exist for antibiotic use in treatment of periodontal infections
because of lack of adequately powered trials assessing disease- and person-specific indications. Thus,
dentists are left to decide when adjunctive antibiotics are indicated, and which dental patients need them to
achieve periodontal health. In the context of periodontitis treatment, a biological rationale exists to support
adjunctive antibiotic use against periodontal pathogenic bacteria, but clinical results of their use have
presented conflicting results. Currently, very limited documentation of the prescription patterns and utilization
of antibiotics as periodontal treatment adjuncts among US practitioners exist. Nonetheless, data from
academic studies suggest that adjunctive systemic antibiotics may only be beneficial for certain populations,
as the biological response to treatment is highly variable across individuals. This marked variability warrants
the identification of person- and/or disease-related characteristics that are linked to maximum benefit from
adjunctive antibiotic treatment. Consequently, clear guidelines can then be established for tailored
indications for their use with the ultimate goal of minimizing antibiotic misuse in periodontal treatment to
avoid development of antibiotic resistance. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of
adjunctive Amoxicillin/Metronidazole combination antibiotics to non-surgical periodontal therapy in clinical
practices within the National Dental PBRN by conducting the largest randomized clinical trial (RCT) of
adjunctive antibiotics. Further, within this PBRN study, current decision-making factors for adjunctive
antibiotic prescription will be surveyed to assess the state of affairs in clinical practice. Importantly,
leveraging the well-powered RCT dataset, high responders to adjunctive antibiotic treatment will be identified
and the predictive validity of decision-making factors currently employed by clinicians will be assessed to
develop clear indications for prescription. Collectively, results of adjunctive antibiotic use at present are
ambiguous because indications are based on empirical information without evidence-based guidelines,
which may lead to antibiotic misuse and lack of efficacy. The present pragmatic well-powered RCT was
designed to enable the development of evidence-based guidelines for periodontal adjunctive antibiotic use."
10897111,"Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), transmitted via the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), is of growing public health importance as the etiologic agent of the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America, Lyme disease (LD), which continues to increase in incidence. Although often framed as a pathogen in the Enzootic Transmission Cycle (ETC), there is no evidence that Bb elicits disease in either the reservoir or tick hosts between which it cycles. Here, we conceptualize Bb-infection in I. scapularis ticks as a facultative mutualism that is influenced by microbial dynamics within ticks and the broader context of ecological interactions between ticks and vertebrate hosts comprising the ETC. Ixodes scapularis is a valuable candidate to study networks of ecological interactions, as its microbiome encompasses the spectrum of relationships in which microbes can engage with arthropod hosts from transitory, commensal environmentally-acquired microbes to heritable obligate, intracellular endosymbionts, the most predominant of which is Rickettsia buchneri (Rb). Focusing on interactions hypothesized to influence the Bb-ETC, the proposed study will characterize Bb colonization in ticks, evaluating changes in Bb abundance and gene expression as a function of the presence of the putative nutritional endosymbiont Rb and the tick microbiome as characterized by 1) the relative abundance of bacterial taxa (16S ribosomal RNA) and 2) manipulated, categorical microbiome assemblages (i.e., natural-field collected ticks; artificial-lab reared; and disrupted-lab reared in sterile-containers (SA1). Bb effects on tick life-history traits, survival, metabolism and behavior and associated gene expression (of Bb and tick) will be measured, estimating the benefits/costs of Bb-tick associations, and testing potential mechanisms (SA2). Finally, the cumulative impacts of within-ticks, tick-microbe, and tick-microbiome interactions (Bb-Rb interactions and categorical assemblages) will be estimated and evaluated for the Bb-ETC using two modeling frameworks. An agent based model will focus on microbe-mediated differences in tick bloodmeal engorgement, development, survival, behavior, and fecundity (SA3.1). A compartmental model of Bb-ETC dynamics over a broader time scale will also consider seasonality across multiple cycles. Models, developed in parallel with and informed by field and lab experiments and empirical data will be leveraged to develop a formal tick vectorial capacity definition inclusive of important components and effects of the tick microbiome (SA3.2). These results then will be leveraged to improve understanding of Bb-ETC and prediction of LD risk indicators."

In response to RFA-AA-20-007, which calls for the development of medications to treat Alcohol Use Disorders
(AUD), this U01 application proposes research to advance the CB1 neutral antagonist AM6527 towards IND-
enabling studies for treating AUD. The current therapies for AUD are either behavioral or is limited to drugs
such as disulfiram, acamprosate and naltrexone, which are restricted to specific patient populations in terms of
their therapeutic effects. Given these epidemiological, and economic issues related with AUD, there is an
urgent need for novel pharmacological interventions that are more acceptable and selective towards treating
AUD. Rimonabant, a CB1 antagonist, has proven to have unacceptable adverse effects, possibly resulting
from its CB1 inverse agonist actions. In contrast, AM6527 is a novel, selective, CB1 cannabinoid-receptor
neutral antagonist that is devoid of inverse agonist activity. The preclinical pharmacology of AM6527 in rodents
and other prototypes within this class of compounds in nonhuman primates strongly supports their potential
utility as therapy for AUD. AM6527 has a favorable safety profile, without evidence of adverse side effects
(e.g., nausea, depression) that have been reported with CB1-receptor inverse agonists such as rimonabant
and taranabant in preclinical and clinical studies. Based upon these positive preclinical data indicating its
effectiveness as a CB1 antagonist, we plan to move AM6527 toward IND-enabling studies in preparation for
first-in-man studies to treat AUD. Specifically, our work in this U01 proposal is designed to meet the following
aims: Chemistry, manufacturing, and controls of drug substance, non-GLP preclinical safety studies including
hERG, genotoxicity, ADME and dose escalation studies in two species. The subsequent steps will comprise:
Chemistry, manufacturing, and controls of drug product including formulation development, cGMP scale-up,
stability, and analytical methods; toxicokinetics with single and repeat 28-day dosing safety pharmacology,
followed by advisement on product development planning, IND preparation and preclinical regulatory strategy."

The destruction of β cells in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is mediated by islet-reactive cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that
infiltrate the pancreatic islet. Extracellular Vesicles (EVs) are bilayer membrane structures of diameters 30 –
1000 nm released into the blood by cells throughout the body, at concentrations on the order of 1010 per ml.
Their molecular content of proteins, dsDNA oligomers, microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNAs, and other analytes,
may play multiple functional roles via EV trafficking, and may also provide a diagnostic report back on the
disease site or tissue of origin. As such, EVs can serve as potential sources of T1D biomarkers, perhaps even
providing insights into the genetic and functional characteristics of the pancreatic islet microenvironment.
We propose a program pursuing T1D biomarkers from islet-derived vesicles that couples our cutting-edge,
microfluidic nanoparticle enrichment technology to a suite of multiparameter analytical methods. In AIM 1, we
utilize a distinct set of bulk and single-EV (sEV) transcriptomic and proteomic methods to comprehensively
investigate the molecular contents of islet cells from healthy donors and individuals with T1D, and EVs derived
from those cultured cells. This will yield a set of proteins and RNAs that can uniquely identify EVs from β cells,
as well as insights on the heterogeneity of the islet EVs. Here we also begin to resolve the molecular
signatures that are unique to T1D pathogenesis. The study of islet-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is often impeded by
the limited access to donor islet tissues. The fact that islet-infiltrating CD8+ T cells shed EVs into the blood
stream provides a unique opportunity for monitoring the activities of the islet-infiltrating T cells with circulating
EVs. In AIM 2, we propose a nanoparticle technology to capture T-cell receptor (TCR) bearing EVs in
circulation. We plan to characterize these EVs from healthy and T1D sera to determine the EV populations that
arise from pancreatic islet infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Monitoring these EV populations can reveal key local
events in the pancreas such as T cell activation and cytotoxicity. As we anticipate a low blood abundance of
islet-derived EVs, in AIM 3, we provide a microfluidics-enabled solution to enrich EVs derived from pancreatic
β cells and infiltrating CD8+ T cells from human sera. This integrated sample processing workflow allows
automatic isolation of islet-derived EVs from limited volumes of serum, with minimal hands on time. Analysis of
banked serum specimens will yield a set of candidate biomarkers associated with T1D development, which will
be validated and refined with an independent cohort. Importantly, the proposed study will not only provide EV-
based T1D biomarkers, but also generate datasets that are of high value to the design and development of
antigen-specific immunotherapies for T1D.
Our multidisciplinary team is comprised of scientists and clinicians with expertise in EV biology, T1D
pathogenesis, immunology, multi-omic disease diagnostics, computational biology, and assay development."
10889797,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The molecular tools that allow for targeting specific cell types in mammalian retina are essential for
understanding how this complex tissue works and responds to disease. Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)
provide safe and long-lasting expression and offer a powerful way to target retinal cells in a rapid, cost-
effective, and efficient manner. The challenge is to develop AAV-based tools that allow for cell-type- or
subtype-specific labeling and manipulation so that only the desired retinal cell types will be targeted.
 One of the major strategies for developing cell-type-specific AAVs is to integrate mini-promoters that can
drive cell-type-specific gene expression into AAVs. To design such mini-promoters, Cis-regulatory modules
(CRMs) in the genome, e.g., enhancers, which are considered as the primary determinants of cell-type-specific
gene expression, are often combined with minimal basal promoters. Multiple methods have been developed to
nominate cell-type-specific CRMs for AAVs. However, the efficiency has not been high, especially for non-
abundant cell types or sub-types in the retina.
 We have pioneered the study of cell-type-specific CRMs in the retina and explored strategies that can
increase the efficiency of identifying them. Putative CRMs are often nominated based on chromatin
accessibility due to the binding of transcription factors (TFs) and consequent low nucleosome occupancy.
However, many of the chromatin accessible putative CRMs are not active and fail to drive cell-type-specific
gene expression in vivo. We found that pre-screening of chromatin accessible putative CRMs based on the
density of cell-type-specific TF binding sites (TFBSs) can significantly increase the efficiency of identifying
active cell-type-specific CRMs. Based on this result, we hypothesize that cell-type-specific CRMs can be
efficiently designed based on cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and by enriching for cell-type-specific
TFBSs, and integrating these CRMs into AAVs can render specificity.
 The proposed studies will test this hypothesis in two aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether cell-type-
specific CRMs can be efficiently nominated based on cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility and TFBSs
enrichment. In Aim 2, we will determine whether assembling cell-type-specific TFBSs into synthetic CRMs can
provide cell-type-specificity in AAVs.
 In summary, the proposed studies will develop novel strategies for designing cell-type-specific CRMs
and generate valuable AAV tools to advance retinal studies. As AAV-based gene therapy was approved by
FDA for treating inherited retinal dystrophy (e.g., Luxturna), this study could also benefit future gene therapy."
10891498,"Lymphocytes must correctly localize to mount effective immune responses. To do this, lymphocytes
migrate through tissue environments with very different biophysical characteristics, including extravasation
from blood vessels and crawling through cell-packed or extracellular matrix-rich tissues. To navigate through
these diverse environments, lymphocytes squeeze through constrictions and migrate in low- or high-adhesive
environments. However, there is a key gap in the understanding of how specific cytoskeletal effectors regulate
force generation, shape changes, and cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions during lymphocyte migration in
different settings. Given their relevance to immune function, primary T lymphocytes are a highly significant
model to investigate cytoskeletal regulation of the varying modes of amoeboid cell motility in three-dimensional
(3D) environments. Formin family proteins are cytoskeletal effectors involved in mediating actin network
remodeling. Formin-like-1 (FMNL1) and Diaphanous-homologue-1 (mDia1) are the two most highly expressed
Formins in T cells. We recently determined that FMNL1 is required for T cell transendothelial migration (TEM)
and trafficking to inflamed tissues. Interestingly, our preliminary data support that FMNL1 and mDia1 have
distinct functions in T cell migration through confined environments. Our goal is to achieve a more
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms by which the cytoskeleton enables migration through diverse
tissue environments by determining the mode of action of Formin proteins in T cell motility. We will investigate
the mechanisms by which Formins generate mechanical forces during T cell migration, the contribution of
Formins in promoting T cell nucleus passage through constrictions, and how Formins regulate T cell motility in
vivo. We will also determine if FMNL1 and mDia1 act independently or in concert with the Arp2/3 complex
and/or Myosin-IIA. Our hypothesis is that to promote migration through complex environments FMNL1
mediates force generation from the back of the T cell while mDia1 creates force and membrane protrusions at
the cell front. To test this hypothesis, we will use a multi-faceted approach, including genetic/mutational
approaches and advanced imaging techniques in complementary model systems in vitro and physiological
environments in vivo. Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms by which FMNL1 and mDia1 promote T cell
transendothelial migration. Aim 2: Determine how FMNL1 and mDia1 regulate T cell motility within 3D
environments with diverse biophysical characteristics. Aim 3: Define how Formins regulate T cell extravasation
and interstitial motility in vivo. Overall, our studies are significant in that they will advance our knowledge of T
cell migration by providing new data to determine the mechanism of action of Formins in T cell motility and if
they cooperate with Myosin-IIA to promote migration through environments with varied biophysical
characteristics. Thus, this work has the potential to provide important insight into novel ways to therapeutically
modulate lymphocyte migration, such as in autoimmune settings and inflammatory diseases."

essential for their ability to replicate intracellularly, which is the specialized type IV secretion system (T4SS)
called Dot/Icm. The Dot/Icm is an incredibly versatile secretion apparatus that has the capacity to translocate
into host cells a repertoire of over 300 different proteins with different biochemical functions and diverse structural
properties. The goal of this project is to determine the structure and assembly of the Dot/Icm machine and
elucidate how the individual Dot and Icm proteins contribute to machine function at the molecular level. We will
combine advanced cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) with genetic and biochemical approaches to determine
the pathway of Dot/Icm machine assembly (Aim 1) and to determine the mechanism by which cytosolic ATPases
recruit effectors and mediate changes in the Dot/Icm structure (Aim 2). Furthermore, we aim to characterize the
translocation pore in the host cell membrane that serves as the protein-conducting channel for Dot/Icm effectors
(Aim 3)."

Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is ensured by using recombination to create crossovers
(COs) between homologous chromosomes. Recombination is initiated by a DNA double-stranded break (DSB)
that can be repaired either as a CO or a noncrossover (NCO), but how any given DSB is slated for CO or NCO
repair has remained enigmatic despite a detailed understanding of the genetic networks involved. In the
current proposal, we describe our approach for addressing how the CO/NCO decision is made and how
genome-wide CO patterning mechanisms act locally at a DSB to influence repair outcome. We will use
chromosome structural variants as a system for manipulating DSB repair outcome in Drosophila melanogaster.
We recently showed29 that heterozygous inversions suppress COs locally outside the inversion breakpoint by
altering repair outcome in favor of NCOs and that they simultaneously trigger a genome-wide increase in COs
by altering repair outcome in favor of COs. We are building two research areas based on these results. First,
we are exploring how heterozygous inversions shuttle DSB repair away from a CO repair outcome by carrying
out a genetic analysis of recombination in these zones of suppression. This genetic analysis has two parts, a
candidate gene approach to look for genes that change the distribution of COs and NCOs near inversion
breakpoints, and a molecular genetic analysis of recombination events to determine which recombination
pathways are used. We will take a complementary approach to these studies and use Hi-C and super-
resolution imaging to ask if there are local chromosome structure and/or synaptonemal complex changes at
the inversion breakpoint. Our second research area will ask how heterozygous inversions trigger a genome-
wide increase in COs. To determine the mechanisms that mediate this increase, we will cytologically assay the
kinetics of CO formation in heterozygous inversions, determine if normal CO patterning mechanisms are
bypassed in order to facilitate the increase in COs, and determine which recombination pathways are used to
form the increased COs. In sum, we will leverage our understanding of how heterozygous inversions influence
the CO/NCO decision into general models that address how meiotic recombination and crossover patterning
intersect to create the final recombination landscape. Furthermore, these experiments will elucidate how
structural variants lead to chromosome aneuploidy and subsequent infertility in the human population."

 Atrophy is complex and broadly defined as non-specific degradation of tissue and/or cells. Age-related
skeletal muscle atrophy affects approximately 50 million people.1 Due to the increasing aged population,
understanding mechanisms and treatment for muscle atrophy is a public health priority. In the vocal folds
(VF)s, atrophy of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscle is a commonly reported cause of dysphonia.2,3 The
prevalence and etiology of TA atrophy are not yet fully understood, but can occur due to ageing4 and/or
idiopathic/iatrogenic denervation5–11 yielding incomplete glottal closure, decreased maximum phonation time,
and increased glottal airflow.12–14 Importantly, VF atrophy encompasses a multifaceted process that can involve
the VF lamina propria and epithelium as well.15,16
 In the absence of accessible human donor larynges, the rat has emerged as a surrogate to investigate
TA physiology, including atrophy.6–10,17 However, the rat TA differs from human TA in fiber type composition.18
Specifically, the rat TA consists of nearly all type II fibers19 whereas the human TA consists of ~40% type I
fibers and 60% type II fibers.20 The validity of rat models of TA structure and function is an area of debate,
potentially leading to an incomplete understanding of critical biochemical processes. More importantly,
treatment approaches for vocal fold atrophy are limited. This proposal will address this knowledge gap by
comparing atrophic responses (i.e. aging and denervation) across other muscles with varying fiber type
distributions to determine the relevance of fiber type on etiology of atrophy. These data will provide a
foundation for a refined model with the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies to assist the
millions of patients with voice-related disabilities."
10864856,"More than 2 million stroke survivors currently living in the U.S. are obese. Obesity is known to exacerbate age-
related declines in function in these individuals and is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and quality of
life. Weight-loss interventions are well-studied in neurologically healthy individuals and are shown to be effective
for attenuating functional decline and improving quality of life. Despite these established benefits, there is
currently an absence of studies investigating the effects of intentional weight loss on physical and/or
psychosocial function in individuals following stroke. We propose a trial aimed at Enhancing Mobility and
Psychosocial function in Obese Veterans following stroke via Weight loss and ExeRcise (EMPOWER). This trial
leverages a 15-week multidisciplinary approach to weight loss, via an existing lifestyle and weight management
program, including caloric restriction, with or without concurrent supervised exercise training, as the catalyst by
which remediation of physical and psychosocial impairments promote enhanced recovery in obese Veteran
survivors of stroke. We posit that successful weight loss will result in improvements in physical and psychosocial
function (compared to control subjects) and that concurrent exercise will result in improved outcomes when
compared to weight loss alone. The VHA 2010 Management of Stroke Rehabilitation Guidelines recommends
that patients receive a formal rehabilitation assessment, the results of which should be used to determine the
appropriate level of care and develop evidence-based interventions. However, without information regarding the
effects of obesity and weight management on physical and psychosocial function as well as data on the long-
term benefits of the program, evidence to guide decisions regarding the most appropriate approach to post-
stroke rehabilitation for obese Veteran stroke survivors will remain elusive and recommendations for best
available treatment cannot be met. Data from the proposed trial will have important clinical significance by
determining the extent to which this type of program improves (or not) physical and psychosocial outcomes in
Veterans following stroke and will provide a foundation for future studies aimed at establishing effectiveness of
this approach to post-stroke care for Veterans."
10866533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Activation of ion channels upon binding multiple ligands at distinct subunits or domains is essential for synaptic
transmission and cellular signaling. Despite recent advances in understanding their 3-dimensional structure,
there remains for many channels a fundamental gap in our understanding of the sequence of events by which
multiple binding sites and domains coordinate to open and close the channel pore. A major barrier to bridging
this gap is that ensemble-averaged binding measures from many channels at once occlude observation of the
distinct asynchronous binding steps that underlie the sequence of binding events at each individual channel. To
overcome this barrier, I will use innovative single-molecule fluorescence methods developed in my lab in
combination with my prior expertise with zero-mode waveguide nanophotonic arrays that enable optical tracking
of each individual binding step. The objective of this proposal is to determine the energy landscape for 1) the
sequence of stepwise binding events that drive activation of cyclic nucleotide gated (CNG) channels critical for
visual and olfactory sensation, and 2) modulation of GABAA receptors by benzodiazepines (BZDs), one of the
most widely prescribed psychotropic drugs today. The rationale is that optical tracking of individual binding
events that are the chemical stimuli by which these channels operate will enable determination of the sequence
of distinct energetic events that must at least partially occur prior to pore opening and thus are difficult to measure
with electrophysiological approaches. The specific aims will: 1) Establish the energy landscape for sequential
binding at a CNG channel; 2) Quantify the likelihood of CNG channel opening with each distinct binding step,
which will test existing disparate model predictions; 3) Develop a mechanistic model for CNG channel activation
that accounts for each distinct binding step; 4) Determine the energy landscape for BZD-binding or sequential
agonist binding at GABAA receptors, and 5) Establish whether or not BZDs alter distinct agonist binding steps.
The proposed research is significant because it will provide a necessary foundation for understanding the
dynamic sequence of events governing ligand-driven behavior in these channels, which currently remain only
poorly understood. The results will have an immediate positive impact as a quantitative benchmark for
computational, structural, and functional studies aimed at uncovering the physical basis for the observed
changes in energy. Ultimately, understanding the full sequence of events during channel activation is essential
not only to advance our fundamental knowledge of ion channel mechanisms, but also to facilitate development
of therapies targeting distinct steps in the activation pathway. Long-term, this knowledge will enable the rational
design of new therapies to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life."

Mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic damage are early pathological features of the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-
affected brain. Microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) plays a major role in AD and have deleterious effects
on mitochondrial and synaptic function. Accumulation of abnormal Tau, including Tau oligomers, causes
mitochondrial and synaptic damage, inflammation, and memory impairment. The underlying mechanisms of
abnormal Tau accumulation and strategies to eliminate them to restore mitochondrial function remain largely
unknown. Cyclophilin D (CypD) is an integral part in the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition
pore (mPTP), leading to cell death. Loss of CypD protects against Aβ-induced mitochondrial and synaptic injury.
However, the role of CypD in tau-mediated mitochondrial and Tau pathology has not been explored. In our
preliminary studies, we found that CypD specifically interacts with tau in AD brains and Tauopathy model. Loss
of CypD robustly reduced hyperphosphorylated Tau and Tau oligomers and restored mitochondrial and cognitive
function in human mutant Tau mice. Furthermore, CypD-deficient Tau mice revealed suppression of induction of
proinflammatory mediators. These exciting results lead us to hypothesize that CypD-mediated mitochondrial
dysfunction provokes neuroinflammation, contributing to abnormal tau metabolism and clearance. To test this
hypothesis, we will investigate whether blockade of CypD promotes abnormal tau clearance consequently
reducing tauopathy and thereby alleviating tau-induced aberrant mitochondrial and cognitive decline in AD.
Utilizing novel genetically manipulated CypD-AD mouse models and neuronal culture with altered CypD levels
in tau-rich environment, and AD cybrids containing patient AD-derived mitochondria, we will elucidate CypD-
dependent mechanisms underlying Tau pathology, clearance, mitochondrial alterations, and neuroinflammation."

Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has recently emerged as a powerful tool to obtain high-
resolution protein structures in their native state. Although major advances in hardware, data
collection, and data processing have enabled close to angstrom resolution of protein structures,
obtaining good specimens remains challenging and has become the bottleneck in single-particle
cryo-EM. Cryo-EM requires protein molecules embedded in a very thin layer of vitreous ice. This
is not easy because some proteins diffuse quickly to the air-water interface of such a thin sample
before vitrification and immediately undergo denaturation, aggregation, or adopting preferred
orientations. These events render the sample unsuitable for cryo-EM. Also, problems with protein
particles not going into the holes of the sample grid are encountered. We hypothesize that protein
particles can be distributed more uniformly on and maintain proximity to the grid surface by
covalent attachment. This proposal seeks to facilitate quality specimen preparation by developing
a specimen platform that utilizes the tetrazine ligation, a highly efficient biorthogonal reaction, to
capture and covalently attach protein particles to the grid surface. We will achieve this objective
by pursuing two specific aims: 1) develop tetrazine functionalized monolayer graphene grids, and
2) evaluate the quality of the resulting grids for single-particle cryo-EM. Unlike affinity grids that
rely on reversible noncovalent interactions to bring proteins close to the grid surface, our covalent
capture approach is innovative in capturaing proteins irreversibly. This prevents the release of
already bound particles and is particularly advantageous for low protein sample concentrations."

10873172,"Abstract: Racial and ethnic disparities in maternal adverse outcomes remain a significant public health
problem. Studies conducted in New York City (NYC) hospitals have shown that minority women are more likely
to deliver in low-quality hospitals and that they are also at a higher within-hospital risk of severe maternal
morbidity (SMM) than white women, even after accounting for type of insurance. Although these studies
represent important pointers in our understanding of SMM disparities, there are still many open questions
about how quality of delivery hospitals drives the higher rates in adverse outcomes observed for minority
women. First, it is unknown whether racial/ethnic differences in delivery hospital quality (between and within)
exist in cities or regions other than NYC, especially in rural areas. Second, there is little information on the
reasons for differences in where women of different racial/ethnic status deliver. Third, previous efforts
examining racial disparities in healthcare delivery have mainly focused on individual-level factors overlooking
the broader macro-level societal and structural conditions (e.g., structural racism) that may be at play. Finally, it
is unknown how important policies such as Medicaid expansion have impacted obstetric hospital quality,
especially minority- and rural-serving hospitals. Research studies investigating higher level factors that
transcend individual-level factors to explain racial/ethnic disparities in maternal outcomes are urgently needed
to design effective interventions. Thus, the proposed study will address the following: 1) Determine the
contribution of delivery hospital quality to racial/ethnic disparities in maternal mortality and SMM; 2) Examine
within-hospital racial/ethnic disparities in risk-adjusted maternal mortality and severe morbidity and identify
whether these disparities are associated with types of medical insurance and broader societal and structural
conditions; 3) Determine societal- and individual-level maternal factors associated with using versus bypassing
high-quality hospitals; 4) Identify the impact of expanded Medicaid income eligibility to adults earning up to
138% federal poverty level on: (Aim 4a) hospital quality (especially safety-net and rural-serving hospitals); and
(Aim 4b) the incidence of maternal mortality and SMM, either overall or by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic
status. We will use birth certificate data linked to hospital discharge data and supplemented by other datasets
from eight U.S. states from 2000-2019 to develop a risk-adjusted maternal mortality and SMM composite
outcome which will allow us to rank hospitals. We will subsequently use hospital ranking to examine the
contribution of hospital quality to racial/ethnic disparities. The aim on Medicaid expansion will make use of a
natural experiment framework and difference-in-difference analysis resulting in comparing each state to itself,
before and after Medicaid expansion. At the end of the study, we will have a better understanding of
racial/ethnic disparities in the health care system among all mothers in eight states and will identify potential
areas for improvement that can have profound implications on reducing disparities."
10873173,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 We and others have shown that stimulation or potentiation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5)
reverses cognitive deficits in rodent models relevant for schizophrenia and other neurological disorders. We have
also made the discovery that co-activation of another mGlu receptor subtype, termed mGlu3, dramatically
potentiates mGlu5 signaling in the hippocampus as well as in in vitro culture systems. We demonstrate here that
co-activation of mGlu3 and mGlu5 induces hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and potentiates induction
of LTP by afferent stimulation. Furthermore, mGlu3 activation enhances hippocampal-dependent learning in an
mGlu5-dependent manner. Using mice in which mGlu3 or mGlu5 can be deleted in a cell-type specific pattern,
we have also found that loss of either receptor from hippocampal pyramidal cells eliminates the ability of mGlu3
agonists to enhance long-term potentiation or improve performance in a hippocampal-dependent cognitive task.
These findings provide a mechanistic bridge to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other human
genetic studies showing associations between polymorphisms in the GRM3 gene and impaired cognitive function
in schizophrenia patients.
 Additional co-expression studies suggest that this specific mGlu3/mGlu5 cross-talk may also occur in
other brain regions that are critical for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
For example, mGlu5 also regulates PFC-dependent cognitive function and our preliminary data suggest that
activation of mGlu5 induces a novel form of LTP at excitatory synapses from the amygdala projections onto a
specific population of inhibitory interneurons that express somatostatin (SST-INs). Mechanistically, these may
reverse reductions in PFC inhibitory transmission that are associated with cognitive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia. Both mGlu3 and mGlu5 are expressed in SST-INs, and both have been implicated in forms of
memory that depend on activation of SST-INs. We have also found evidence for specific signaling interactions
between mGlu3 and mGlu5 in SST-INs. Based on these results, we postulate that mGlu3 and mGlu5 interact to
induce LTP in PFC SST-INs. Furthermore, we hypothesize that either mGlu5 PAMs or mGlu3 agonists will
enhance forms of cognition that require activation of SST-INs in the PFC, and that this response will be increased
upon co-activation of these receptors. Using mGlu3 and mGlu5 subtype-selective modulators, mice lacking each
receptor in a cell-type specific pattern, as well as chemogenetic, optogenetic, and a Drugs Acutely Restricted by
Tethering (DART) approach to modulate activity of specific neuronal populations, we will test the hypothesis that
mGlu3 activation enhances multiple other forms of cognitive function that are regulated by mGlu5 potentiation.
Finally, we will determine if this mGlu3/5 interaction is intact after juvenile exposure of rodents to phencyclidine,
which induces cognitive deficits that may be relevant for schizophrenia."

The goal of the proposed K23 Career Development Award is to provide the PI with the mentorship, knowledge,
and skillset to develop into an independent investigator studying neuroscience-inspired, targeted therapeutics
for comorbid mood and cognitive dysfunction after stroke. The PI's mentoring team will provide him with
training in the brain-based mechanisms of mood disorders, use of functional MRI to examine target
engagement, and clinical trial design and data analytic approaches. The training will incorporate individualized
tutorials, formal coursework, national and international workshops and conferences, research collaboration,
manuscript preparation, and grant writing. The training is integrated in a research proposal that evaluates the
efficacy and target engagement of a digital intervention for the depression-executive dysfunction syndrome
(DED) after stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Post-stroke DED is associated with more
persistent depressive symptoms and executive dysfunction, worse social functioning, and greater loss of
independence than post-stroke depression or executive dysfunction alone. Existing interventions have limited
evidence of efficacy, side effects, and can be difficult for stroke patients to access. Novel and scalable
approaches that target the mechanisms underlying post-stroke DED may yield more efficacious treatment. To
address these barriers, the PI proposes to study a remote intervention for post-stroke DED that combines an
iPad-based digital therapy called AKL-T01 that intensively trains rapid multitasking skills, together with virtual
metacognitive coaching. AKL-T01 is designed to target a common mechanism underlying post-stroke
depressive symptoms and executive dysfunction, which is reduced intrinsic functional connectivity in the
executive control network (ECN). Virtual metacognitive coaching is included to address patient unawareness of
deficits to enhance transfer of training gains to daily functioning. In this pilot clinical trial, N=70 patients with a
first-time stroke and DED will be randomized to receive the intervention, or to a control condition with general
and non-targeted cognitive stimulation together with metacognitive coaching. Participants will complete
measures of executive dysfunction, depressive symptoms, and disability at baseline, week 3 (mid treatment),
and week 6 (end treatment). Participants will complete resting state fMRI scans at baseline and week 6. Linear
mixed-effects models will test the hypotheses that the intervention will be associated with greater
improvements in executive function, depressive symptoms, and disability relative to the control group. Also
tested is the hypothesis that the intervention group will have greater change in intrinsic functional connectivity
in the ECN from baseline to week 6, relative to the control group. This project has the potential to address, in a
scalable manner, a highly debilitating consequence of stroke. It will generate data that can be used to optimize
treatment efficacy, further refine and personalize the intervention, and further validate a target for treatment."
10873284,"The GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat expansion at the C9orf72 locus is the most common genetic
cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and the related neurodegenerative disorder, frontotemporal
dementia (FTD). Documented cellular defects associated with the C9orf72 mutation include loss-of-function
through haploinsufficiency, RNA foci triggered by the C9orf72 transcript variants containing G4C2 repeats, and
the accumulation of toxic dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs). Currently, there is no effective treatment due to the
complex etiology. However, not all C9orf72 mutant carriers develop ALS or FTD, suggesting that other factors
modify the disease onset and progression. Twin studies have estimated that epigenetic factors contribute
about 40% of risk to develop ALS/FTD. DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism that enables
our genome to integrate extrinsic signals, and dysregulation of DNA methylation plays important roles in
disease onset and progression. Interestingly, hypermethylation of the G4C2 repeats and the CpG islands
(CGIs) flanking G4C2 in the C9orf72 promoter were observed in C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients, suggesting a
pathological role for DNA methylation. We hypothesize that the methylation of G4C2 repeats and two CGIs
represents a critical factor in determining the onset and progression of signs and symptoms of ALS/FTD in
C9orf72 mutant carriers. To test this hypothesis, we will apply our DNA methylation editing tool
(CRISPR/dCas9-TET1/DNMT3) to manipulate these methylation events in motor neurons derived from
C9orf72 ALS iPSCs and cortical neurons derived from C9orf72 FTD iPSCs as well as in transgenic mice
carrying a human C9orf72 mutant bacterial artificial chromosome, and then phenotypically characterize the
methylation-edited neurons and mice. Precise editing of CGIs and G4C2 methylations will evaluate the
functional significance of these epigenetic events during the pathogenesis of C9orf72 ALS/FTD and
demonstrate the therapeutic potential of editing methylation for the most commonly known cause of ALS/FTD.
To identify epigenetic factors that modify the disease onset of C9orf72 mutant carriers, we will compare the
disease-affected and non-affected brain regions by single-cell DNA methylation and RNA sequencing of motor
and prefrontal cortex samples from the same C9orf72 mutant carriers diagnosed with ALS or FTD. We will also
compare the methylome and transcriptome of motor neurons converted directly from the skin fibroblasts of the
same C9orf72 ALS patients at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. These comparisons between the
disease-affected and non-affected brain regions and the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic neurons will
determine whether the DNA methylation of CGIs and/or G4C2 is an epigenetic factor modifying the onset of
C9orf72 ALS or FTD. Additionally, these comparisons will identify other novel DNA methylation and
transcriptional events contributing to the disease onset in C9ofr72 mutant carriers, thus guiding the future study
of these factors protective against the development of ALS or FTD in C9orf72 mutant carriers."

The long-term goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the immune mechanisms involved in the
pathogenesis of allergic diseases and asthma. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved and highly regulated
essential homeostatic process that ensures lysosome-dependent bulk degradation of cytosolic proteins and
organelles. Alterations in autophagy have been implicated in numerous conditions afflicting humans, including
aging, cancer, neurodegenerative processes, and immune responses, as autophagy is essential for the
generation of both innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogens. This project is motivated by recent
published data from our laboratory and others, demonstrating that abrogation of autophagy, particularly in
dendritic cells (DCs), induces severe airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in animal models (J Allergy Clin Immunol,
2016; Science. 2017). Moreover, several studies clearly demonstrate that genetic variants in Atg5, a critical
gene in autophagy, are significantly associated with childhood asthma. In support of those studies, our
preliminary results suggest that: A) treatment with autophagy inducers reduces AHR in animal models
sensitized with allergens, B) enhancement of autophagy in dendritic cells induces IL-10 and significantly up-
regulates PD-L2, which in turn robustly polarizes naïve T cells towards Foxp3+ regulatory T cells, C) genetic
ablation of autophagy, particularly in DCs, induces steroid-resistant AHR in murine models, and D) autophagy
is severely impaired in pulmonary dendritic cells obtained from patients with moderate to severe asthma. We
now propose to investigate if enhancement of autophagy, particularly among antigen presenting cells,
ameliorates pathology associated with asthma, suppresses unwanted lung inflammation and ultimately
improves lung inflammation and function. To test this hypothesis, we first designed several approaches utilizing
tissue-specific and conditional knockout murine models established in our laboratory. Second, we intend to
modulate autophagy using a novel and robust autophagy inducer that was discovered recently by our
collaborators at USC. Finally, we will extend our preliminary results in humans by assessing autophagy levels
in the bronchoalveolar fluid and peripheral blood of patients with asthma, and determine if treatment with
autophagy inducers can enhance immune-regulatory pathways. For the human studies we successfully
established collaborations with UCSF pulmonary group and will utilized their lung biopsy repository samples
obtained from well-defined cohorts of patients with asthma including neutrophilic asthma. Furthermore, we
have assembled a team of scientists including a leading expert in autophagy and the chief of clinical
pulmonology at USC to complement our laboratory's extensive experience in pre-clinical models of AHR. We
believe that the results obtained from this study will provide novel insights into an important and previously
unrecognized role of autophagy in asthma."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is devastating for both individuals and society. Because pathology and
neural damage occur so early relative to detectable symptoms, it is important to study early
disease progression, with a focus on detection and treatment. One of the earliest symptoms to
appear in this disease is impairments in spatial navigation, which could be the result of
impairments in navigational computations, memory encoding or retrieval, or some combination of
navigational and memory impairments. Both cortex and hippocampus are important for memory
encoding and navigational computations, with interactions between these two regions supporting
these processes. In navigation, hippocampus is involved in creating a cognitive representation of
the environment. Parietal cortex is involved in the translation of this cognitive representation
based on body-centered location into the appropriate navigation decision. Furthermore,
interactions between these regions have been shown to be impaired during sleep in rodents
modeling Tau and amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation aspects of AD. Thus, we will test the hypothesis
that impaired hippocampal-cortical interactions during navigation underlie deficits in spatial
navigation in a mouse modeling Tau and Aβ aggregation (TAβA; AIM 1). Additionally, we will test
the hypothesis that these interactions can be rescued via 40Hz stimulation of either parietal cortex
or hippocampus (AIM 2). This project will expand our knowledge of systems level dysfunction as
a consequence of TAβA, and how this impacts cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, this project will
provide insight into how new, preliminary treatments for AD designed to ameliorate TAβA effects
systems, spatial navigation, and neural function."

Phenotypic plasticity and its regulation by contextual signals is of central importance to tumor biology. TGFβ is
a major regulator of cell phenotype during development, tissue homeostasis, regeneration, and cancer. Our long-
term goal is to elucidate TGFβ signaling and the principles that govern its effects on normal and neoplastic cells.
This proposal is based on our long-standing contributions to delineating the TGFβ signal transduction pathway,
its context-dependent effects, and its aberrant activity in tumorigenesis and metastasis. The proposed work
builds on recent progress towards understanding how TGFβ-activated SMAD transcription factors regulate
differentiation in stem and progenitor cells (Aragón et al Genes Dev. 2019; Wang et al Cell Stem Cell 2017), the
basis for TGFβ-mediated tumor suppression and the evasion of this effect (David et al Cell 2016; Huang et al
Cancer Disc. 2019), and the development of experimental models of dormant metastasis to expose the role of
TGFβ in this poorly understood, yet highly significant aspect of cancer (Malladi et al Cell 2016). Moreover, we
recently elucidated how TGFβ triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) in pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDA), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and embryonic stem (ES) cells, and how these
phenotypic plasticity events are coupled either to fibrogenesis or to differentiation depending on the epigenetic
context (Su et al Nature 2019). Based on these advances and unique experimental models and human tumor
single-cell analytics that we have developed, we will address long-standing questions of growing importance:
How does TGFβ signaling regulate epithelial cell plasticity in development and cancer? What is the role
of TGFβ-induced intra-tumoral fibrosis during tumorigenesis? What is the relevance of this mechanism
to TGFβ-induced organ fibrosis? How does TGFβ drive metastasis-initiating cells into EMT-linked growth
arrest? Does this state render cancer cells immune-evasive during metastasis dormancy? To investigate
these questions, we will dissect an obscure RAS effector, RREB1, which we recently identified as a key partner
of TGFβ-activated SMAD transcription factors in the induction of fibrogenic and developmental EMTs. We will
elucidate the role of EMT-linked intra-tumoral fibrosis in tumor growth and metastasis. Focusing on metastasis-
initiating cells, we will follow recent evidence that TGFβ imposes a quiescent, immune evasive state that provides
long-term survival to dormant metastasis cells and potentially resistance immunotherapy. Collectively, these
studies will provide knowledge and experimental models to delineate the role of TGFβ in fibrosis, tumor invasion
and metastasis, and will better define how and when to target TGFβ in cancer."

Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) remain a significant public health threat. With a lack of treatment options, the

PR, a wide range of mutations in three two components systems (TCS), phoP/Q, crrA/B, pmrA/B, and mgrB, are
thought to induce PR, but most have not been functionally validated. Additionally, little is known about how these
mutations affect bacterial fitness and virulence, and if they can increase polymyxin minimum inhibitory

elucidate the downstream phenotypic effects of a broad selection of mutations in these genes. Candidate: As
an infectious diseases clinician with a strong background in bacteriology and molecular biology, I am well suited
to pursue translational research focusing on the determinants of antibiotic resistance. Further training in bacterial
pathogenesis, anti-microbial resistance, bacterial genomics, and biostatistics will be crucial for the completion of
the proposed research and advancement of my career. With primary mentor Dr. Anne-Catrin Uhlemann, I have

laboratory at Columbia University Irving Medical Center has the microbiology, molecular biology and sequencing
tools to complete the proposed research. The laboratory contains a large collection of CRE and PRKP clinical
isolates that have undergone whole genome sequencing. Columbia has a long track record of supporting the
career development of young investigators. Approach: Our central hypothesis is that the accumulation of
multiple mutations in the PR cascade leads to rising MICs and changes in bacterial virulence through activation
of unique cellular pathways. To elucidate the contribution of various mutations we will systematically insert these
into two CRKP clinical isolates utilizing our CRISPR-Cas9 system (Aim 1). We will characterize how these
changes affect MIC and LPS. In Aim 2 we will evaluate if PR can alter bacterial fitness and virulence through
growth curves, co-incubation analyses, Galleria mellonella killing assays and a mouse pneumonia model. In Aim
3 we will utilize RNA-seq to characterize the differential phenotypes of the PR mutants by defining the cellular
targets of the TCS. Through this we aim to identify novel pathways involved in PR and virulence and validate
these targets through CRISPR mediated modification. In addition to elucidating how changes in the TCS induce
PR and affect bacterial fitness, this work has the potential to identify novel pathways involved in PR and virulence.
This would yield crucial information necessary for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PRKP infections."

10889467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often leads to epilepsy with a delay of weeks to months after the initial trauma.
Immediately following and for days to weeks after TBI, increased extracellular glutamate leads to hyperexcitation
of neurons, and to neuronal injury. These effects are exacerbated by post-traumatic downregulation of glutamate
transporter 1 (GLT-1), the protein responsible for synaptic glutamate clearance. Long-term, post-TBI glutamate
excitotoxicity leads to a progressive loss of vulnerable inhibitory interneurons and GABAergic intracortical
inhibition, and contributes to a range of chronic post-TBI symptoms, that include post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE).
We identified that short-term treatment with the injectable beta-lactam ceftriaxone (CRO) increases GLT-1
expression and mitigates post-TBI neuronal death and seizures in a rat acquired epilepsy model, albeit
incompletely. CRO-mediated GLT-1 rescue does not persist beyond cessation of treatment, while the TBI-
induced depression of the gene that encodes for GLT-1 persists up to 6 weeks after TBI. Since CRO and similar
injectable antibiotics cannot be given for weeks to months without complications, a sustained non-antibiotic
treatment that can be administered safely and conveniently is highly desirable. The atypical non-bactericidal
beta-lactam clavulanic acid (CLAV) also increases GLT-1 expression and protects against glutamate-mediated
damage in animal models. This well-tolerated, orally available drug can potentially serve as a mainstay of
prolonged post-TBI GLT-1 upregulation strategies aimed at sustained neuroprotection and anti-epileptogenesis.
However, essential questions pertaining to CLAV mechanism and efficacy should be addressed in the preclinical
setting. Based on prior work showing that CRO modulates GLT-1 after TBI, and published data showing CLAV
does the same in other animal models, we propose a set of exploratory experiments aimed to (1) determine the
dose-response relationship between CLAV and GLT-1 expression following TBI, (2) test whether long-term beta-
lactam treatment mitigates TBI-induced long-term GLT-1 depression, oxidative stress, and inhibitory
interneuronal death, (3) test whether long-term beta-lactam treatment prevents or mitigates progressive, post-
TBI decrease in cortical inhibition, seizure threshold, and PTE. Given that no intervention targeting post-TBI
epileptogenesis is available, our proposed experiments will be the first step toward a novel treatment. Despite
the strong implication of glutamate-mediated changes in post-traumatic epileptogenesis, there is presently no
proven long-term clinical method to clear excessive glutamate from the extracellular space after injury. Our
proposal combines established basic science methods with a novel application of CLAV treatment as an
antiepileptogenic intervention which can be administered acutely after TBI. As CLAV is already FDA approved
for human use, positive data from the proposed studies may be rapidly translated to further development of this
post-TBI treatment strategy, and to human trials. Beyond TBI, enhancement of glutamate transport may also
prove useful following various other forms of brain injury."

Cataract is an opacity of the eye lens that can result in blindness. In 2010, cataract affected 15% of the population
by age 60 and nearly 70% of the population by age 80. Despite the disease’s prevalence, surgery that replaces
the lens with a synthetic implant remains the current standard of care. This strategy prevents access to treatment
for people without adequate healthcare. Cataract is caused by protein aggregation in the lens, the majority of
which is comprised of a class of proteins called crystallins. Understanding the mechanisms by which crystallins
aggregate to form cataract is critical for developing therapeutics that can prevent their formation as an alternative
to cataract surgery. Maturation of the lens is accompanied by loss of organelles and protein degradation
mechanisms; therefore, the eye lens is metabolically inactive and crystallins by necessity are extremely long-
lived proteins. Research on their biophysical properties have proven that crystallins are unusually soluble and
stable. However, due to subjection to decades of damaging radiation as well as the loss of lens homeostasis
mechanisms, crystallins accumulate post-translational modifications (PTMs) such as oxidation and deamidation.
These PTMs are thought to alter their solubility and stability, thereby promoting cataract-related aggregation in
the lens. Deamidation, the conversion of asparagine or glutamine to aspartic or glutamic acid, respectively, is
the most common PTM. It has been shown that variants with one or two deamidation sites have increased
susceptibility to aggregation and oxidation as well as decreased stability. The long-term goal of this project is
investigate how deamidation promotes aggregation. This research will be performed on variants with 3, 5, 7, and
9 sites of deamidation and builds on previous insights developed by our lab. I hypothesize that the mechanism
of aggregation of these variants will depend on the extent of deamidation. In variants with fewer sites of
deamidation, I predict aggregation is formed by increased anion-p interactions. In highly deamidated variants, I
propose aggregation increases hydrophobic exposure from altered protein dynamics. Here, I will investigate
these possibilities with solution-state NMR and mass spectrometry dynamics experiments. These will be
complimented with biophysical techniques that quantify the extent of aggregation, dimerization, and oxidation. I
will then look structure of deamidation variant aggregates with solid-state NMR. Finally, preliminary evidence in
our lens suggests the HgS could be performing a novel active role in the lens as a last resort redox buffer. I will
investigate this with proteomics experiments that monitor the disulfide linkages that have been implicated in this
role."
10893351,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pten is a prominent tumor suppressor whose tumor protective ability is exquisitely sensitive to alterations in level
of expression or activity. This property has led to speculation that mechanisms controlling Pten expression, sta-
bility, conformation, homo- and heterotypic protein interactions, localization, or catalytic activity, including post-
translational modifications, are prominent targets for deregulation in human cancer. However, this concept has
not been critically tested at the organismal level, mainly because of difficulty in manipulating Pten in mice due to
its essential role in embryogenesis. Our long-term objective is to close this knowledge gap by the use of mouse
models in which specific Pten domains or regulatory mechanisms are inactivated and to apply the information
gained to develop innovative strategies for the treatment of human cancers with Pten alterations. As the next
step in the pursuit of this goal, our objective here is to understand, at the physiological level, how the phosphor-
ylation status of the C-tail region regulates Pten. Based on extensive preliminary studies, we hypothesize that
individual C-tail serine/threonine residues differentially regulate the stability, localization, interactome and/or
phosphatase activity of Pten in vivo, thereby impacting its tumor suppressive functions in both Akt-dependent
and -independent fashions. We propose to test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. In the first aim, we
will comprehensively examine tissues and cultured cells from a core set of eight nonphosphorylatable and phos-
phomimetic C-tail mutant mice for changes in Pten biological properties and functions. In the second aim, we
will monitor these same mouse strains alongside cohorts of wildtype, Pten hypomorphic and Pten+/– mice for the
development of spontaneous tumors, with emphasis on prostate and mammary gland lesions. Additionally, we
will conduct a comparative analysis of pre-tumorous and tumorous tissues of these strains for alterations in Pten
properties and functions. By completing these aims, we expect to gain insight into the properties of these C-tail
mutants in physiologically relevant settings with regards to protein stability, localization, catalytic activity and
binding partners, and to integrate these findings with information about the biological and tumor suppressive
functions that these mutants have lost, preserved, or gained. The expected overall impact of this innovative
proposal is that it will fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of the normal and neoplastic func-
tions of the second most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. This knowledge will con-
ceptually advance the cancer biology field, improve our understanding of the Akt signaling pathway in normal
physiology and cancer, and lay the foundation for the development of new therapeutic strategies that will improve
the clinical outcome of cancer patients with alterations in Pten."

 The period immediately following discharge from acute psychiatric hospitalization is a time fraught with
gaps and discontinuities in care for many patients. Despite this time of elevated risk, patients often lack
sufficient transitional supports and related resources for returning to the community and resuming long-term
outpatient treatment. The long-term goal is to improve the continuity of care for patients with serious mental
illness (SMI) by supporting a safer and more efficient bridge from hospital to outpatient care. The objective of
this proposal is to test the effectiveness of our empirically-supported, multi-component mHealth intervention
called tFOCUS in comparison to enhanced assessment and monitoring to ensure safety and an adequate
standard of care (“SAFE”). tFOCUS will be deployed during the high-risk period directly from hospital to
outpatient care and provide real-time assessment and intervention to patients via a mobile app, plus user
engagement and clinical status updates to clinicians via a web-based “dashboard.” To speed the translation of
findings to clinical practice, we will rigorously test the effectiveness of tFOCUS in a fully-powered Hybrid Type
1 Effectiveness-Implementation trial, while collecting information on implementation barriers/facilitators to
promote uptake in real world settings. The central hypothesis is that tFOCUS will improve illness self-coping
and treatment attitudes, which will lead to reduced: psychiatric symptoms, rehospitalizations, and suicidal
ideation/behaviors. tFOCUS will also lead to improved post-discharge treatment engagement and illness
recovery.
 The aims of this proposal are: (1) to conduct a fully-powered, RCT (n=180) to test the effectiveness of
treatment-as-usual (TAU) + tFOCUS vs TAU + SAFE; (2) to examine potential mediators and moderators of
treatment effects; and, (3) to identify patient, staff, and organizational/system-level factors that may
facilitate/hinder tFOCUS implementation. The primary outcome will be overall psychiatric symptoms. The
approach is innovative because it is one of the first randomized controlled trials conducted in the U.S.
specifically evaluating an mHealth aftercare support program for patients with SMI directly moving from
hospital to outpatient care. Also, this study is unique in that it will collect data to generate hypotheses about
implementation strategies via a multi-pronged approach involving key stakeholders and additional
implementation ata. Upon successful completion of the proposed R01 research, this study will contribute
significant actionable data that will lay the groundwork for a large-scale Hybrid Type 3 trial of tFOCUS in
diverse hospital settings."
10893448,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
We propose a novel virtual reality intervention to increase abstinence, enhance future orientation and delayed
reward preference, quantify brain responses, and improve recovery outcomes in early recovering alcohol use
disorder (AUD) persons. We also intend to demonstrate that aged future selves representing alternate futures
are the ‘active ingredient’ of the intervention. Impaired future orientation and discounted future outcomes
appear to be a behavioral endophenotype for AUD and other addictions. With recovery attempts usually failing
within 6 months of treatment, there is considerable room for improved efficacy for long-term recovery.
Converging evidence indicates that a hallmark of AUD is preference for immediate hedonic rewards and
impaired visualizing and planning for the future. To enhance visualization of the future, we extend prior work on
episodic future thinking through virtually experiencing plausible alternate futures. Our intervention increases
connectedness with one’s future by immersing subjects in a realistic interaction with their Future Selves in
divergent futures that rely on present decisions. We integrate self-discrepancy theory, focusing on the gap
between “what is” and “what could be” to heighten motivation, and we promote engagement by maximizing the
novelty and emotional salience of the experience. Early-recovering AUD persons enter a compelling virtual
world, are introduced to a time travel narrative, and interact with two digitally age-progressed Future Selves;
one after 15 years of ongoing alcohol abuse, and the other after 15 years of recovery. Both Future Selves
speak to the participant about their recovery rewards, or losses from returning to problem drinking, and
personal struggles during the journey. Strong emphasis is placed on agency, optimism, and decision-making.
After iterative development and tests of feasibility and safety, the paradigm yielded promising preliminary data
showing increased prosocial behavioral change and brain target engagement. Interacting with Future Selves in
virtual reality significantly increased abstinence rates compared to a treatment-as-usual comparison group,
increased identification with the future, increased behavioral delay-of-reward, and enhanced brain activation
and connectivity in executive and introspection networks. The current proposal will test this paradigm in a
larger sample with an expansion of Recovery Future Self interactions (30 daily experiences) to show efficacy
compared to a virtual reality control. Aim 1 will test the effectiveness of the virtual reality intervention on
abstinence and alcohol use outcomes at 1 and 6 months, future self-similarity, and behavioral delay-of-reward.
Aim 2 will demonstrate brain target engagement by showing stronger executive and introspective network
function during decision-making and at rest, and executive network connectivity that correlates with increased
delayed reward preference. Further, brain activation will provide a neural signal that could be used as a
predictive marker for intervention responders. The ultimate goal is to deliver a potent recovery support
intervention that is readily implemented in the context of promoting long-term recovery."
10893630,"Project Summary: A robust autoresuscitatory reflex (AR) is critical to newborn survival from birth. The
transition to independent breathing and accommodation of breathing interruptions, apneas, that are common in
neonates and infants, requires a coordinated cardiorespiratory response for recovery. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-
HT, serotonin) and the brainstem raphe cells that produce it, referred to as Pet1 neurons, organize and drive
successful AR in newborn animals and humans. Unsuccessful AR is understood to be a major contributor to
the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), where alterations in the brain 5-HTergic system have been
described in ~half of human SIDS cases, including increased number of 5-HT neurons of differing morphology
(smaller, simpler, perhaps immature), deficiencies in autoreceptor 5-HT1A binding, and decreased levels of 5-
HT and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2, the rate-limiting biosynthetic enzyme for 5-HT). We propose
investigations to reveal in mice how aspects of this SIDS brain 5-HTergic phenotype develop prenatally. Our
approach is informed by two recent findings. First, Pet1+ neurons in the raphe expressing high levels of 5-HT
identity genes (e.g. Ddc, Vmat2, Gata3, Pet1) have been identified, smaller in size, with modest levels of
autoreceptor 5-HT1A yet remarkably expressing little or no TPH2 and 5-HT. We call these novel cells para-5-
HTergic neurons, signifying their partially shared molecular phenotype, shared location, and developmental
emergence with 5-HT neurons. Second is the discovery of neurotransmitter switching, a noncanonical form of
neuronal plasticity that occurs in response to stressors. Recent data support its role in shaping the 5-HTergic
neuronal system, where stressors may drive some para-5-HT neurons to produce 5-HT as an adaptive
response. Preliminary findings reveal that para-5-HT neurons derived from rhombomere (r) 4 densely and
selectively innervate respiratory and arousal centers, and that gestational exposure to intermittent hypoxia
results in an increased number of TPH2+ cells postnatally with as yet uncertain 5-HT levels. We propose that
para-5-HT neurons are a pliant population that may be transformed when challenged prenatally by
hypoxia to produce 5-HT in newborns as a compensatory mechanism to support AR. We hypothesize
that in response to the major SIDS risk factor of prenatal hypoxia, certain para-5-HT neurons adaptively
transform to produce 5-HT to rectify a 5-HTergic signaling imbalance that hinders the AR and,
alternatively, that an insufficient transformation plays a critical role in SIDS. We will test this by exposing
mice to intermittent hypoxia or normoxia during gestation, characterizing cellular and molecular phenotypes
and querying neurotransmitter transformation (Aim 1); further, we will determine the effect of acute activation
or inhibition of these r4-para-5-HT neurons on the AR in these mice (Aim 2), and we will examine phenotypic
markers of para-5-HT neurons in human SIDS and control brain tissue (Aim 3). This novel, functionally
defined, para-5-HT cell type and plasticity may be highly relevant to newborn viability."

 The current understanding of the pathophysiologic and socio-economic processes that initiate CKD and
the paths by which they progress to ESRD are poorly understood, resulting in limited treatments. There is a
compelling unmet need for prospective studies to accurately phenotype patients with CKD using a combination
of kidney biopsy, clinical, biologic, and socioeconomic factors to develop individualized care to improve patient
outcomes. Over the past four years, at the local level we assembled a highly skilled, interdisciplinary team of
clinical researchers, physician-scientists, clinicians, research nurses, patient advocates and a Community
Advisory Board. This team designed, implemented and sustained a highly successful, ethically sound and safe
recruitment site (RS) for the Kidney Precision Medicine Project: 1) We performed the very first KPMP consortium
kidney biopsy in September 2019 and were the first RS in the consortium to perform 30 kidney biopsies,
successfully enrolling patients with a clinical diagnosis of hypertensive or diabetic chronic kidney disease and
yielding sufficient tissue for research protocols as well as for pathological diagnosis; 2) We collected and linked
clinical, biological and socioeconomic data of the biopsy participants; 3) We focused our efforts on African-
American and Latinx populations at a very high rate in order to address the disproportionate burden of CKD as
well as the historical lack of inclusion of these populations in cljnical research, mandated by the NIH, completing
22 out of 11 (73%) of biopsies among these groups. At the consortium level our team members have made
meaningful contributions to the major organizational and operational aspects of KPMP.
 The main goal in this proposal will be population identification, patient recruitment and obtaining clinical
phenotype data, biosamples and kidney biopsies. To accomplish this goal we will 1) Identify, recruit, enroll, and
biopsy 34 patients annually from 3 large HS serving more than 51,996 patients with CKD and diabetes and/ or
hypertension and follow patients longitudinally; 2) Implement ethically-sound, systematic quality-assured
processes to obtain clinical and demographic data, bio-samples and kidney biopsies from patients with CKD in
a longitudinal clinical study; and 3) Develop and implement patient-centered processes to promote long-term
engagement and retention of study participants in KPMP. Our successful track record as a recruitment site for
procurement of kidney tissue from patients with CKD attributed to diabetes or hypertension from a large, diverse
patient population makes us an ideal site for the continuation of the KPMP. Our ability to recruit patients from
multiple health systems with novel informatics tools, an ethically rigorous approach to consenting for kidney
biopsy and coupled with a rigorous and safe methodology is a powerful combination we bring to the KPMP. Our
innovative approach to this FOA will not only provide the data to generate new knowledge to improve both the
diagnosis and treatment of CKD, but also serve as a model for future kidney precision medicine initiatives and
their expansion over time."

A growing body of literature demonstrates that informal caregiving is a social process and commonly involves
more than a single caregiver especially for older adults with dementia. Historically, caregiving research has
been focused on the psychosocial and physical health and wellbeing of the individual primary caregiver and
has generally overlooked the social contexts in which caregiving occurs, such as the role of interactions among
multiple caregivers. Our recent study to evaluate the scope and potential impact of informal caregiving
networks for persons with dementia (PWD) using an egocentric social network approach, i.e., one based on
the informant's perspective, has revealed that there are complex group dynamics and allocation of care
activities, including financial obligation, among multiple members of the network. We also learned that the
outcomes of caregivers (e.g., financial hardship) and PWD (e.g., hospital admissions) may be offset by
network characteristics and dynamics. The social network approach is well aligned with the phenomenon of
informal caregiving for PWD as it accounts for group dynamics of a social network and helps explain how such
network characteristics affect members' behaviors and well-being. However, for widespread use of caregiving
network assessment in both research and practice settings, a reliable and easy-to-use assessment tool will be
necessary, but no such tools currently exist. In response to RFA AG-23-002, we propose to develop CareNet,
an interactive digital tool with an embedded interview/survey, that will be easily deployed by providers and
researchers to fully characterize a PWD's caregiving network. We will employ an iterative user-centered design
approach, involving key stakeholders (i.e., caregivers, healthcare and social service providers, and
researchers) to optimize design and content considerations. In Phase 1, we will conduct interviews with diverse
informal caregivers to assess their needs and views about the meaning of caregiving from multiple
perspectives, which will inform adaptation of our egocentric caregiving network survey to better reflect the
pluralistic culture of caregiving. In Phase 2, we will conduct a series of usability evaluation sessions with the
key stakeholder participants followed by pilot-testing in a controlled, observational setting. Finally, in Phase 3,
we will field-test CareNet to evaluate usability and acceptability in field settings in which providers and
researchers interact with a caregiver to collect caregiving network data. We will refine features and functionality
in anticipation of large-scale testing of utility and future applications in practice settings. Our final, fully
functional CareNet will promote systematic caregiving network assessment by providers in practice and wide
use of social network analysis for characterizing informal caregiving of PWD by future investigators to expand
the empirical knowledge of informal caregiving."
10893352,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer; frequently diagnosed after it has spread
from the ovary to the omentum fat pad. A major challenge to understanding and targeting EOC is the
heterogeneous nature of the disease, which makes it difficult to develop treatments that effectively target and
destroy all cancer cells. This heterogeneity results in complicated molecular landscapes with subpopulations of
highly invasive and chemoresistant tumor cells. It is critical to understand how this heterogeneity in cancer cells
develops and contributes to EOC disease progression. Polyploidal giant cancer cells represent a small
subpopulation of drug-resistant and dormant cancer cells that survive treatment and later awaken to form new
tumor cells through amitotic budding. Single cell biophysical analysis of tumor organoid cultures will be used to
determine how polyploidal giant cancer cells and other invasive cells contribute to EOC disease progression.
In the EOC tumor microenvironment, cancer cells frequently encounter metabolic stress from nutrient
deprivation, hypoxia, and toxic therapeutics, which can trigger metabolic reprogramming to promote cell survival.
Cells can undergo a metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation to meet energy demands of
survival and invasiveness; this shift in metabolism has been correlated with highly energetic mitochondria, lipid
droplet disappearance (lipolysis), and autophagy. This is especially important in PGCCs, which have increased
nutrient demands in part to their larger size and more invasive phenotype. Additionally, EOC metastases form
from multicellular aggregates that are shed from the primary tumor into the adipocyte-rich abdominal cavity.
Previous studies have demonstrated that peritoneal adipocytes can transfer free fatty acids to EOC cells to
provide cellular energy for metastatic tumor growth. Fatty acids provide a rich energy source for ATP-dependent
actin polymerization and actin-based protrusions are critical for cell migration and during metastasis.
We hypothesize that invasive EOC cells store energy from exogenous lipid sources (including adipocytes and
lipid-rich ascites fluid) in cytosolic lipid droplets, and under metabolic stress use these lipid droplets to generate
mitochondrial ATP that is required for invasive cell migration through autophagy. To prove this hypothesis, we
will use a novel 3D culture model and animal studies to track metabolic changes in individual chemoresistant
EOC cells as well as study heterogeneity in lipid droplet metabolism. The proposed research will investigate the
role of metabolic and treatment stress in activating lipid metabolism (Aim 1) and autophagy (Aim 2), and
determine how metabolic alterations in subpopulations of highly invasive cells (including PGCCs) contribute to
the development of aggressive tumors (Aim 3). The proposed studies will reveal novel mechanisms contributing
to cellular heterogeneity and dysregulated metabolism, along with new therapeutic targets to investigate in EOC."

The cycle of repeated composite-restoration replacements is a pernicious problem—each replacement risks
pulpal injury, increased tooth weakness, and eventually, tooth loss. The problem is pervasive—nearly 70% of all
composite restorations are replacements and the leading cause of failure is recurrent marginal decay. Unlike
amalgam, composite lacks the inherent capability to seal discrepancies at the material/tooth interface. The
adhesive that bonds the composite to the tooth is intended to seal the interface, but the adhesive seal to dentin
is fragile—it is readily damaged by acids, enzymes, and other oral fluids. Bacteria and bacterial by-products
infiltrate the resulting marginal gaps, demineralize and decompose the tooth, and further erode the adhesive,
leading to wider and deeper gaps that create an ideal environment for bacteria to proliferate. Biodegradation by-
products accumulate at the dentin/adhesive interface and increase the virulence of cariogenic bacteria,
provoking a positive feedback loop that escalates the degradation. There is an urgent need to address this
composite/tooth-interface vulnerability through multi-factorial approaches that: i) remineralize damaged dentin;
ii) inhibit bacterial attack; and iii) provide durable polymers. Recent findings from our lab offer significant promise
for meeting this need. First, we have synthesized novel self-strengthening polymers—the self-strengthening
mechanism provides a persistent, intrinsic reinforcement of the polymer network in both neutral and acidic
conditions. We have engineered antimicrobial and remineralizing peptides and tethered them to self-
strengthening-adhesive monomers. Building on our progress, we propose to use both engineered peptides and
antibacterial agents tethered to novel polymers to provide a “bio-hybrid” adhesive that will serve as a durable
barrier to recurrent decay. Our threefold strategy exploits: (i) polymer-tethered engineered peptides and
antibacterial agents to simultaneously provide antibacterial activity, delay biofilm formation, and remineralize
dentin; (ii) self-strengthening polymers that resist hydrolysis-mediated degradation; and (iii) iterative feedback
between synthesis, characterization, and modeling to forecast performance under relevant in vivo conditions."

Giardia lamblia belongs to a group of gut pathogens associated with impaired child development and gut function,
especially in children with inadequate nutrition. Although most Giardia infections in these children are clinically
silent, Giardia may lead to longterm detriments. For reasons that are unknown, many of these children cannot
clear the parasite. Further, infected children may be at risk for gut dysfunction as a result of Giardia infection,
even if they are asymptomatic. We hypothesize that susceptibility to Giardia and subsequent disease result from
a change in the resident intestinal microbial community as a consequence of low dietary protein. Animal models
provide an opportunity to dissect how an individual pathogen like Giardia impacts early life intestinal health, and
a model to understand mechanisms whereby specific nutrients support host defenses and physiology. The
objective of this proposal is to use our novel mouse models of Giardia infection in a state-of-the-art environment
where we can define and control for all microbial exposures in the gut (gnotobiotics). We will combine our
gnotobiotics expertise with expertise in microbial metagenomics and metabolomics for a rigorous examination
of how dietary influences exert a functional change in the complex community or resident intestinal microbes. In
Aim 1, we will determine how resident intestinal microbes normally protect against persistent Giardia infection
by transferring intestinal microbes from a well-nourished animal into susceptible hosts, and vice versa
transferring permissive microbes from hosts with chronic infection into nourished mice. We will specifically
examine whether the ability of microbes to metabolize bile acids are key to protection against Giardia infection,
and whether microbes are necessary for effective immunity. In Aim 2, we will determine how Giardia and protein
deficiency synergize to cause intestinal barrier dysfunction. Our model has a clinically relevant outcome of growth
restriction and loss of intestinal barrier function during the combined insult of limited protein intake and Giardia
infection. We will use our gnotobiotic model to generate metagenomic and metabolomic data that will identify
pathogenic shifts in microbial communities during Giardia infection. We will specifically elucidate the role of
aromatic amino acid metabolites and bile acids on gut function in the protein deficient state, as well as whether
Giardia promotes pathogenic bacterial functions to cause enteropathy. Our gnotobiotic approach is innovative
and will allow us to characterize critical interactions between resident intestinal bacteria and infection with Giardia
that have not previously been elucidated. The proposed research will address longstanding questions related to
the role of Giardia on gut function, and specifically whether Giardia exerts pathogenesis by altering microbial
metabolism. Beyond Giardia pathogenesis, these results are expected to lead to new considerations for how
healthy bacteria provide protection against gut infection, and how chronic enteropathogen exposures cause gut
dysfunction absent diarrhea. We hope to discover new pathways that might leverage emerging microbial or
molecular-based therapeutics to improve health of children vulnerable to malnutrition and intestinal infections."

 The U.S. is facing a serious crisis of rising rates of maternal mortality and severe morbidity, which are
attributable to multiple factors, such as the persistent, deep shortages of maternal care workforce in
disadvantaged urban communities and rural areas. Since half of U.S. counties do not have a single
obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN), access to maternal care is a daunting challenge facing the nearly seven
million reproductive-age women living in those counties.
 To address the problem of unequal distribution of clinicians, policymakers have taken considerable efforts
in recent decades. Among the efforts, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) remains the single largest
policy intervention that has been launched to recruit clinicians to health professional shortage areas (HPSAs).
The NHSC has experienced a dramatic expansion during the past decade, first through the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009 and then by the Affordable Care Act in 2010. Prior studies have found
that these two Acts have raised the NHSC’s annual budget by over 100% and led to a significant expansion of
the NHSC’s clinician workforce, such as OB-GYNs and certified nurse-midwives. However, no study to date
has evaluated the impact of the NHSC expansion on disparities in maternal care and outcomes between the
HPSAs and other areas.
 This proposed project aims to examine these issues and fill the gap in the literature. To our knowledge, it
will be the first study to examine the effect of the recent NHSC expansion on disparities in maternal care and
outcomes. Specifically, the project aims to assess how the recent NHSC expansion affects disparities in (1)
maternal mortality overall and in-hospital mortality in particular, (2) severe maternal morbidity during childbirth
hospitalizations and the associated hospital delivery costs and length of stay, (3) labor and delivery care, and
(4) timing and adequacy of prenatal care and birth outcomes.
 To examine these aims, we will use multiple large, national data files over an extended period of 15 years
between 2005 and 2019. To analyze the data, we will take two complementary approaches, including a
difference-in-differences method, and an instrumental variable approach. Our analyses are expected to provide
rigorous quasi-experimental evidence about the effects of workforce policy changes on disparities in maternal
mortality and severe morbidity, which are key objectives of the Healthy People 2030. Our study findings will
have important implications for the upcoming implementation of the 2018 Improving Access to Maternity Care
Act, the latest NHSC policy change intended to better serve reproductive-age women in HPSAs by further
increasing the NHSC supported maternal care providers."
10895369,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with no cure. IPF development follows a
unique pattern with fibrosis starting at the lung periphery and progressing toward the lung center. Little is
known about the mechanism underlying the periphery-to-center progression of the disease. Recent studies
suggest that the higher level of parenchymal expansion (strain) in the lung periphery serve to amplify and
perpetuate the progression of fibrosis upon initial lung injury. Systematic inquiry of the spatiotemporal
progression of pulmonary fibrosis has been challenging and cost prohibitive, because (1) correlative data on
both lung pathology and lung mechanics are difficult to obtain due to the prolonged disease progression in
human; (2) the most commonly used mouse model of bleomycin-induced fibrosis spontaneously resolves and
therefore fails to fully reflect human fibrosis, and (3) current in vitro lung tissue models do not reproduce an in
vivo-like strain gradient and the complex biomechanics existing in the native alveolar structure. The objective
of this project is to understand the spatiotemporal relation between pulmonary fibrosis and mechanical stretch
in the lung and develop a stretched engineered lung slice (ELS) model to study the multiscale biomechanical
mechanism of differential stretch-induced spatial progression of pulmonary fibrosis. The main hypothesis is
that the high level mechanical stretch at the lung periphery amplifies the pro-fibrotic signaling in injured lung
cells, thus initiating fibrosis and perpetuating the periphery-to-center fibrosis progression in the lung. Recently,
investigator’s team have adopted decellularization technique to create ELSs that support the long term growth
of lung cells in structurally-persevered human lung scaffolds. To utilize the ELS in the study of the fibrosis
progression, investigators plan to adopt a multiscale biomimicry strategy where the integration of ELS with a
gradient stretching device allows macroscopic modelling of the differential strains existing at the lung periphery
and lung center, and the preserved structure in the ELS allows microscopic modelling of the mechanical signal
transduction and cellular injury existing at the single alveolus level. The aims include characterizing the
spatiotemporal evolution of pulmonary fibrosis and mechanical stretch in both human and rat fibrotic lung
samples, developing a differentially-stretched, ELS model to test how realistic strain gradients affect spatial
progression of fibrosis upon epithelial injury, and understanding the multiscale biomechanical mechanism of
stretch induced fibrosis initiation and progression. The combination of mechanical stretching and computational
modeling with the lung slice model will substantially improve the utility of this underutilized model for lung
disease research, thus greatly facilitating the research efforts in pulmonary fibrosis and improving the
understanding of a major disease mechanism that is poorly examined in the past."
10895470,"Project Summary/Abstract
Fluid flow transduction pathways are critical for development, however it is little known how cells sense and
transduce fluid flow signals. Defects in flows and flow sensation result in developmental diseases including
primary ciliary dyskinesia, heterotaxy, and congenital heart disease. While the Polycystin transmembrane
proteins have been implicated in fluid flow sensation and transduction, few other proteins regulating flow
sensation and transduction have been identified. This study aims to characterize novel flow sensory pathway
regulators and build on the Polycystin flow sensory complex using the highly tractable left-right (L-R) patterning
system of zebrafish embryos. In this system an asymmetric fluid flow is sensed by ciliated cells and breaks L-R
symmetry by repressing a key target gene, dand5, leading to asymmetric expression of downstream genes. To
identify flow sensory pathway components in the L-R patterning system, I performed a reverse genetics screen
and identified several novel regulators. Focusing on four of these, my overarching hypothesis is that they
function as part of flow signal sensation or transduction, upstream of dand5 repression. I will test this
hypothesis through two Specific Aims: 1) Test the requirement of novel regulators for cilia formation, motility,
flow generation and flow sensory pathway output using a novel pathway sensor I am building and 2) Test the
hypothesis that pkhd1l1, or Fibrocystin, functions in flow sensation in cilia as part of the Polycystin complex.
Overall, this work will expand our understanding of flow sensory pathways by mechanistically placing novel
regulators into the L-R patterning pathway. Moreover, this work aims to build on the current Polycystin flow
sensory complex by dissecting Polycystin-Fibrocystin interactions, something which will have implications for
L-R patterning and kidney diseases."

This U24 application from the Wake Forest University School of Medicine (WFUSM) describes plans by expe-
rienced investigators and staff to serve as the data coordinating center (DCC) for the IMProving mobility After
revasCularizaTion in Peripheral Artery Disease: the IMPACT PAD Trial (IMPACT PAD), a 2 × 2 factorial N=386
trial. We will build on our successes in dozens of large, long-term trials and epidemiologic studies. Our DCC
experience will help ensure success in the implementation of this trial by overseeing all data related aspects of
the trial. We have a single specific aim: to provide project coordination, administration, data management,
and biostatistical support for the IMPACT PAD Trial. We will accomplish this by facilitating and guiding the
protocol development process, providing scientifically sound study design, excellent operational and analytical
methodology, a dedicated focus on recruitment, high quality follow-up and fidelity to the interventions, moni-
toring safety and working with the DSMB to ensure participant safety and careful study management, working
with the CCC to monitor the seven field centers, and by leading development and maintenance of the protocols,
manual of procedures (MOP), forms and other study documents. We believe that this trial will have nearly all
the complexities of large multi-center studies, particularly for the DCC in standardization across sites.
 We have several strengths: (1) a team whose members are experts in the coordination of multi-center trials,
including several that are ongoing, (2) experience with peripheral artery disease (PAD) trials including the on-
going PROVE trial, (3) experience with exercise trials working with the intervention proposed in this trial and
nutraceuticals, (4) specific project management expertise, (5) a history of efficient and effective communication
with field centers, the executive committee, and the project office, and (6) success working with Dr. McDermott
(of the CCC) on three prior studies (LIFE, ENRGISE, and PROVE).
 WFUSM views clinical trial conduct and coordination as a scientific undertaking, which advances through
continuous evaluation and innovation. While web-based randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been con-
ducted for over two decades, we continue to develop new and innovative strategies for integrating web-based
technology into daily trial activities and incorporating other methods of electronic data capture into trial man-
agement. We coordinated ACCORD, which was the first large-scale RCT coordinated primarily over the web.
The ACCORD system has evolved into the Database for Efficient Administration of Clinical trial OperatioNs
(DEACON) system for web-based trial management which we use for all of our studies. We are constantly in-
venting and evaluating new features to add to the DEACON framework.
 The highly experienced and talented team at WFUSM will create a state-of-the-art DCC for the IMPACT PAD
trial using proven coordinating center models. Personnel will be available from day 1 and have long-standing
working relationships across multiple NIH-funded studies."

The objective or mission of this initiative is to provide support for critical infrastructure to enhance maternal, pediatric, and adolescent HIV therapeutics and prevention, including HIV vaccine research activities on a global scale. To provide opportunities to participate in therapeutic research, clinical trial centers must be situated in areas where infected women and children are located. Domestically, the vast majority of infected women and children are of minority race and ethnicity and often live in urban, inner-city areas in which the medical care system is often overwhelmed and under-funded. Internationally, continuing research in resource-limited countries is critical to address the global problem of pediatric HIV infection.  The funding and conduct of clinical research in such settings offers many challenges though and requires a system that is flexible and responsive, and that ideally provides coordinated care of the mother and child together in a family-centered setting to optimize the maintenance of both woman and child in ongoing health care."
10897188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's Disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) are a leading cause of
death in the U.S. More than 40% of all Medicare patients who die in a given year have AD/ADRD, and the
number of deaths from AD/ADRD are fast growing. Dying individuals with AD/ADRD use more aggressive care
at end of life, including burdensome transitions to the hospital and invasive procedures of questionable benefit,
compared to those with no cognitive impairment. Advance care planning (ACP), the process of discussing and
recording patient preferences for goals of care in the event of patient losing capacity, has been shown to
decrease aggressive treatment and increase use of hospice and palliative care, in particular among AD/ADRD
patients. Barriers to ACP exist, and no research has examined the causal effect of ACP on end-of-life (EOL)
care among AD/ADRD patients using national data. This proposal addresses these gaps by examining two
recent changes in Medicare reimbursement policy: the introduction of ACP billing codes on January 1, 2016,
and the introduction of comprehensive care planning (CCP) billing codes on January 1, 2017. The CCP targets
cognitively impaired patients and consists of several mandated components, including development, revision
or review of an Advance Care Plan. No direct evidence exists on the effect of these two reimbursement
changes on EOL care; in general or among AD/ADRD patients. This proposal will utilize Medicare claims data
merged with several supplementary data sources to examine multiple physician and patient factors associated
with ACP and CCP billing, and will innovatively apply two quasi-experimental study designs to separately
examine the causal effect of ACP and CCP billing on EOL care spending and multiple measures of EOL care
utilization commonly used as indicators for quality of EOL care, among AD/ADRD patients nationwide.
Advanced statistical learning techniques will be employed to further correct bias and improve precision of
causal estimates. The Specific Aims are: (1) To identify the physician and patient characteristics associated
with ACP and CCP billing for AD/ADRD patients; (2) To determine the effect of ACP billing on EOL care
utilization and spending among AD/ADRD patients using a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD); (3) To
determine the effect of CCP billing on EOL care utilization and spending among AD/ADRD patients using an
Instrumental Variables (IV) approach. IMPACT: This project will provide rigorous and critical evidence to
directly inform effective policies targeted at improving EOL care for AD/ADRD patients. Further, this K01
application will establish the applicant as one the few health economists with expertise in AD/ADRD, geriatrics
and palliative care. It will prepare her to become an R01-funded independent investigator in policy evaluations
that lead to improved quality of care and quality of life for the aging population, in particular AD/ADRD patients."

Despite poor clinical outcomes there has been very limited response to therapies targeting hepatic inflammatory
response especially in patients with malnutrition. Sarcopenia or skeletal muscle loss is a major component of
malnutrition in AH and adversely affects clinical outcomes in these patients. Potential mechanisms by which
sarcopenia can aggravate AH include reduced skeletal muscle metabolism of ethanol and impaired ammonia
disposal due to decreased hepatic ureagenesis promoting ammonia induced hepatotoxicity. Even though
targeting sarcopenia is an innovative approach with a mechanistic rationale to improve outcomes in patients with
AH, this is not part of the therapeutic strategy in the ongoing NIAAA funded AlcHep network. Our published and
preliminary data show dysregulated skeletal muscle protein homeostasis or proteostasis in response to ethanol
in myotubes, mouse models, and human patients with alcoholic liver disease including AH. We also observed
that ethanol exposure increases the skeletal muscle sensitivity to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that results in
impaired protein synthesis and increased autophagy and consequent sarcopenia. Interestingly, expression of
canonical LPS receptor, TLR4, is increased in myotubes and in muscles from mice exposed to ethanol and
patients with alcoholic liver disease. Consistently, P65NFkB, a downstream target of TLR4, is activated with
increased. Expression of myostatin, a TGFβ superfamily member, a known transcriptional target of P65NFkB
and negative regulator of skeletal muscle protein synthesis is also increased with LPS and ethanol. Interestingly,
low molecular weight hyaluronic acid, especially fragments 35Kd and lower (HA35) have been reported to inhibit
or modulate TLR4 signaling via specific receptors in a context specific manner. We made a novel observation
that HA35 reversed ethanol and LPS induced reduction in myotube diameter, impaired proteostasis and signaling
perturbations in both myotubes and mice exposed to ethanol. We will use HA35 initially in myotubes exposed to
ethanol and mice chronically fed ethanol with binge (Gao model) that has significant sarcopenia and liver injury
similar to that in human AH. In these preclinical studies, we will determine the molecular mechanisms by which
HA35 reverses sarcopenia in AH. We will study the tissue responses to HA35 in ethanol-fed mice including
skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown and signaling responses. We will translate our preliminary and
preclinical data into clinical application by treating human subjects with HA35, a food supplement, following acute
ethanol exposure. We will also test if HA35 is beneficial in patients with moderate AH, a group of patients for
whom there are currently no therapies available despite significant muscle loss and there are no ongoing clinical
trials in moderate AH in the Alchep network. A data coordinating center will assist with these human studies.
These studies will permit rapid therapeutic translation of our studies using HA35 as a novel, mechanism-based
therapy for sarcopenia in AH, currently a major unmet need in this patient population."

Despite advances in operative technology, intraoperative methods for primary tumor and lymph node
detection have not changed in the past 30 years. To this end, we propose to use a fluorescent and nuclear
labeled anti-EGFR antibody (panitumumab) for targeted dual modality imaging (TDMI) of the primary tumor
and lymph nodes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) In this application, we propose to
use labeled panitumumab since it has been successful in several early-stage studies, we introduce two
novel concepts for intraoperative detection of very small (1 mm3) tumor deposits. First, we combine the
high-resolution/depth-limited imaging properties of optical imaging agents with the low-resolution/not
depth-limited properties of nuclear agents. Second, we show that these two agents can be systemically
administered for the detection of tumor-positive lymph nodes. We provide extensive clinical data in
HNSCC to demonstrate that tumor fragments less than 1 mm3 in size can be detected using anti-EGFR
antibody (panitumumab) as the targeting molecular to fulfill the needs of PAR-20-295 entitled, ‘Optical
fluorescent methods and technologies for sensitive cancer detection in vivo’. While use of anti-EGFR
antibodies for imaging alone is not innovative, innovation should be considered in the context of PAR-
20-295 which requires applications use “…probes with previously demonstrated capabilities for the
detection of small tumors”. To this end, we introduce dual modality imaging and leveraging this for
molecular imaging lymph nodes. This study is designed to meet FDA guidelines for a surgical imaging
trials. Patients eligible for head and neck cancer resection will receive a systemic administration of an anti-
EGFR antibody (panitumumab) labeled with either IRDye800 (pan800) or 111Indium (111In-pan) for
fluorescent and nuclear signal, respectively. After systemic administration of both agents, a SPECT/CT will
be performed to identify the location of tumor-positive margins and tumor-positive lymph nodes. The
patient will then undergo resection of the primary tumor and neck dissection using fluorescent and gamma
probe guidance (while maintaining the standard of care). We hypothesize that introduction of targeted dual
modality imaging (TDMI) will improve intraoperative decision making."

10897196,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 50% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with the current standard of
care will fail this treatment, and there is currently no cure for recurrent or metastatic disease. As
a result of our recently completed studies of the connection between cervical cancer metabolism
and radiation resistance, we have found that cervical cancer is highly dependent upon glutamine.
Recent data has also demonstrated that targeting glutamine metabolism not only limits tumor cell
growth, but also improves anti-tumor immunity by reprogramming macrophages in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) towards a more pro-inflammatory phenotype. Given that radiation
therapy (RT) has also been shown to promote anti-tumor immunity, these findings suggest that
the combination of targeting glutamine metabolism and RT may synergize to enhance anti-tumor
immunity and achieve long term tumor control. The purpose of this renewal R01 application is to
perform preclinical mechanistic studies and a corresponding investigator-initiated clinical trial to
support targeting glutamine metabolism with radiation therapy as a novel therapeutic strategy for
radiation-resistant cervical cancers. Our working hypothesis is that inhibition of glutamine
metabolism enhances radiation sensitivity through synergistic metabolic effects on tumor cells
and immune cells within the TME. In Specific Aim 1, we will test whether the combination of the
glutaminase inhibitor, CB-839, and chemoradiation improves anti-tumor immune responses using
paired human tumor specimens collected in the context of an investigator initiated Phase I/II
clinical trial. In Specific Aim 2, using 2D and 3D co-culture systems, we will determine whether
the cytotoxic effects of inhibition of glutamine metabolism are mediated primarily through
metabolic effects on tumor cells versus the combined effects on tumor cells and macrophages. In
Specific Aim 3, using a patient derived xenograft (PDX) library and a novel genetically
engineered mouse model (GEMM), we will determine whether the radiation modifying properties
of CB-839 are dependent upon metabolic editing of the tumor microenvironment, and test new
therapy combinations that will support future clinical trials. This work will generate a mechanistic
rationale and test predictive biomarkers for the inhibition of glutamine metabolism and RT, and in
so doing complete the first-in-human trial of CB-839 + chemoradiation in cervical cancer. This
clinical trial is unique in that it includes an investigational new drug, CB-839, administered with
both conventionally fractionated external beam RT as well as high dose rate hypofractionated
brachytherapy. This design will provide valuable data in humans regarding the effects of RT dose
and fractionation on chemoradiation and CB-839 associated changes in the TME."
11114668,"ABSTRACT
Targeted cancer therapy, in the form of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been a game changer for patients with
cancers driven by activating mutations in genes encoding these proteins. Yet, while we are seeing overall survival
beneﬁts unlike with any new agents in over a decade, cures remain elusive, or non-existent, as resistance to
these agents reliably emerges. The process driving this resistance is the same process that drives invasive
pests' resistance to pesticides, pathogens' resistance to antibiotics and many other phenomena in life: Darwinian
evolution. While this is being increasingly recognized, it has yet to change the paradigm in cancer research where
most projects are centered on a hunt for actionable mutations conferring resistance. While these secondary
mutations are often druggable themselves, we submit that this is a never-ending race that evolution will always
win. We hypothesize that an approach centered instead on studying the evolutionary process itself can help
break this cycle. While there is a robust theoretical literature modeling cancer evolution with mathematics, there
is a relative paucity of research connecting this theory to empirical biology or clinical medicine. To address this
shortcoming, we have worked for the past three years to develop a ﬁrst-in-class evolutionary game assay to
directly measure the eco-evolutionary interactions driving the emergence of resistance in vitro. This assay allows
us to directly parameterize an evolutionary game theoretic model with empiric studies in any system. Here, we
propose to extend our initial observations revealing a vast heterogeneity in evolutionary dynamics under different
agents in vitro to allow for clinical translation by extend ouring assay to an in vivo system. We posit that the new
methods and understanding we will gain during this proposal will beneﬁt the cancer research community as a
whole, as well as provide novel opportunities for therapeutic interventions aimed at disrupting and altering the
evolutionary mechanisms driving resistance."

 This is a renewal application for the Rutgers University CounterACT Research Center of Excellence,
leaders in the discovery and development of drugs to treat poisoning from exposure to chemical threat agents.
The Center focuses on vesicants including sulfur mustard, nitrogen mustard, and other mechanistically related
chemicals and is organized into three Research and Development Projects, each focused on a major vesicant
target: the skin, the cornea and the lung. The overall goal of the Center is to identify specific targets in these
tissues that can be used for therapeutic intervention. To accomplish this goal, mechanistic research using
appropriate translational models for the skin, cornea and lung is being performed by scientific experts in each
of these areas. The Research and Development Projects are supported by a Pharmacology and Drug
Development Scientific Support Core and a Pharmaceutics and Medicinal Chemistry Scientific Support Core,
each consisting of investigators with considerable expertise in drug discovery, delivery and development.
Through mechanistic research, the Rutgers Center has 1) discovered and prioritized several efficacious lead
compounds and 2) developed innovative formulations and delivery systems that augment pharmacological
activity and improve pharmacokinetic profiles. Three lead compounds, two for mustard-induced ocular injury
and another for mustard-induced lung injury, are FDA approved for other indications, and are being advanced
for use as mustard countermeasures. Furthermore, IND-enabling studies have been completed on a lead
compound discovered to be effective against mustard-induced skin injury. The Rutgers CounterACT Center
has established strategic corporate partnerships for advanced drug development with lead compounds and
support by BARDA. A Research Education Core directed at students, postdoctoral trainees, technical staff, and
new and established investigators has been highly successful at training a skilled workforce in
countermeasures. During the next grant period, we will 1) identify and develop second generation drug
products with improved effectiveness, 2) disseminate key findings about mechanisms of toxicity and novel
testing strategies and models, 3) advance current drug leads through the FDA approval process and 4) expand
training and workforce development opportunities. By meeting key research, development, and training
milestones, the Center is well-poised to advance new and repurposed drugs through the approval process for
treating vesicant poisoning in humans."
10897032,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Trauma to the spinal cord disrupts neural pathways that convey signals between the brain and spinal
sensorimotor networks (SSN) that reside below the injury site, resulting in chronic paralysis. There is currently
no cure for spinal cord injury (SCI); however, recent studies involving a small number of humans with SCI have
shown that paralyzed functions can be restored by electrically stimulating the dorsal surface of the lumbosacral
spinal cord. Last year, our team reported the use of lumbosacral epidural stimulation (ES) with intense
rehabilitation enabled recovery of independent standing and stepping by a man with complete paralysis due to
a mid-thoracic SCI that occurred several years prior. The stimulation systems that are implanted in humans with
SCI were originally developed, and subsequently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for use
in humans to treat intractable neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action through which ES alleviates pain is
thought to involve inhibition of pathologic signals transmitted through the dorsal sensory roots and ascending
dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Contrary to pain treatment, computational modeling and electrophysiological
studies indicate ES enables motor functions after SCI via excitation of dorsal root signaling to downstream SSNs.
Assuming appropriate parameters of ES (e.g., pulse frequency, pulse width, pulse amplitude, location on the
dura mater) are applied, SSNs are capable of producing robust motor outputs that result in functions such as
weight bearing standing and/or walking. However, currently available scientific evidence does not explain how
ES interacts with nearby spinal structures to produce functional gains in humans with chronic paralysis. To
address this gap in knowledge, we will temporarily implant spinal electrodes in 32 humans with lower extremity
paralysis to stimulate the dorsal sensory roots and/or dorsal surface of the spinal cord during 10 days of
rehabilitation. Dorsal root stimulation (DRS) and ES waveforms will be independently-controlled to inhibit and/or
activate nearby structures. Each stimulus pulse will be synchronized to electrophysiologic recordings of
downstream neuromuscular activity in order to characterize SSN activity in response to DRS and/or ES
stimulation. We hypothesize unilateral DRS during motor-enabling ES will result in ipsilateral suppression of SSN
outputs. We further hypothesize that bilateral DRS alone will enable motor functions that are similar to those
generated by ES. To investigate the role of rehabilitation during stimulation-enabled motor recovery, we
hypothesize that stimulation-enabled motor performance will improve significantly across 10 motor rehabilitation
sessions with DRS/ES. Completion of this work will generate new information on the interactions that occur
during SSN facilitation via spinal stimulation. This information will be used to develop algorithms that correlate
stimulation waveform properties to neuromuscular recordings and motor performance metrics in order to identify
stimulation settings that facilitate optimal performance of stimulation-enabled motor function in humans with SCI."

Most attempts to quit smoking end in relapse, or a return to regular smoking. One of the biggest threats to
cessation is a lapse (i.e., any cigarette use during a quit attempt). Thus, characterizing why lapses occur is
essential to understanding and preventing smoking relapse. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is
a promising method for characterizing the psychological processes that lead to smoking lapses because it
provides a way to measures patterns of brain activity thought to reflect relevant mental processes as they
change over time. However, methodological issues have hindered the ability to capitalize on this potential and
prevented an understanding of how brain activity and corresponding psychological processes unfold in the
critical moments that immediately precede a smoking lapse. The proposed project will address this knowledge
gap using a novel fMRI paradigm adapted from a well-validated behavioral lapse task. This novel fMRI
paradigm includes an in-scanner delay period that models the ability to resist smoking during acute nicotine
abstinence and a post-scan ad-lib period that captures key aspects of the smoking behavior that follows.
Adults who smoke will abstain from cigarettes for 12 hours before completing the fMRI lapse paradigm. The
goals of the project are to characterize changes in brain activity that lead up to a lapse and to investigate how
these changes are related to concurrent affect and subsequent cigarette use. The study will focus specifically
on linking lapse-related outcomes to time-dependent interactions between two large-scale brain networks: the
executive control network, which includes parts of the lateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, and the default
mode network, which includes parts of the medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices. The central
hypothesis guiding the proposed research is that lapse-related behavior and affect will be predicted by the
extent to which the default mode network and the executive control network are functionally segregated (i.e.,
the strength of the connectivity within the default mode and executive control networks, relative to connectivity
between the networks). The aims of the project are: 1) To examine the association between time-dependent
changes in brain network dynamics and subsequent risk of smoking lapse; 2) To examine the association
between time-dependent changes in brain network dynamics and self-reported affect leading up to a smoking
lapse; and 3) To examine the association between brain network dynamics directly before a lapse and
reinforcement from the smoking that follows. An additional exploratory aim of the study is to evaluate potential
moderators of the association between brain network dynamics and lapse-related outcomes. The proposed
study capitalizes on an innovative experimental fMRI approach to study in real time the neural underpinnings of
discrete smoking lapse episodes. Successful completion of the proposed research will advance theoretical
knowledge regarding the neural and psychological antecedents of smoking lapses. Results will also have
implications for improving the effectiveness of strategies designed to prevent smoking lapses."
10897034,"Project Summary
Neurons are poorly recognized by the immune system which contributes to the ability of neurotropic
pathogens to persist in the CNS but there is evidence that T cells can promote clearance of these
organisms. For the parasite Toxoplasma gondii, T cell production of the cytokine IFN- is important for
resistance in the CNS because it activates hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells to control the
tachyzoite (lytic) stage of the infection. Conversely, in response to cellular stress T. gondii transforms to the
latent bradyzoite stage and forms long lived cysts in neurons. The lack of therapies that target the latent
stage of T. gondii is a significant impediment to the management of this infection. Current dogma holds that
because this stage is in neurons it evades immune surveillance and ensures chronicity. However, there is
accumulating evidence of a more active battle between the host and parasite in the CNS. These
observations indicate that T cell production of IFN- activates neurons to control T. gondii but the ability of
this parasite to persist may be because bradyzoites evade recognition and/or modulate cyst specific
responses. In support of this idea, comparisons between tachyzoite and bradyzoite specific responses
suggest that cyst-specific CD8+ T cells have reduced effector functions. To understand how T. gondii is
recognized in neurons and how the parasite can evade surveillance, novel transgenic reporter systems for
parasites will be combined with host reporters to track the fate of infected neurons in vivo. Additional
studies will determine the impact of IFN- on neurons and live imaging studies will visualize interactions
between T cells and infected neurons and if this results in parasite clearance or evasion of T cell activities.
The findings that emerge from these studies will have a significant impact on understanding how CD8+ T
cell-neuron interactions lead to pathogen control and will be relevant to other neurotropic infections and
neuroinflammatory conditions."
10897041,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardioembolic stroke (CES) is costly, not only financially, but also personally to patients and their families, with
high rates of recurrence and the highest rate of mortality when compared to strokes of other subtypes. A
critical barrier to progress in the field is that currently, the only evidence-based treatment strategy for CES is
initiation of anticoagulation (AC) when an atrial tachyarrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), is identified
post-stroke. However, AF may simply reflect one marker of underlying left atrial (LA) pathology with accruing
evidence suggesting that other changes in cardiac structure and function, such as that which occurs at the
endothelial level, is responsible for thrombosis irrespective of manifestation of AF. Currently, there is no known
means to correctly identity other cardiac pathologies that increase risk for stroke, outside of identification of an
arrhythmia. An ongoing clinical trial (ARCADIA) has offered one definition of atrial cardiopathy, but whether this
definition is sufficient is unknown. Additionally, how such markers once identified impact patient care and long-
term outcomes is also unknown. The purpose of this proposal is to characterize cardiac structure and function
in patients with acute ischemic stroke, by (A) evaluating associations between specific cardiac anatomical
markers and patient long-term functional outcomes (Aim 1) and (B) utilizing advanced imaging techniques to
increase the precision by which such cardiac anatomy is identified to enable prediction of CES (Aim 2).
Defining these currently unknown mechanisms in patients with CES, but without AF will allow for the
development of effective strategies aimed at mitigating recurrent stroke and poor patient outcomes. For Aim 1,
I will follow a previously funded, prospectively enrolled cohort of acute ischemic stroke patients with
echocardiography with strain (sTTE) for up to 5 years post-stroke to assess 3 different measures of patient
outcome: 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS), readmission rates and recurrent stroke. I hypothesize that
specific sTTE markers of LA dysfunction will be associated with worse outcomes. For Aim 2, I will then recruit a
new cohort of acute ischemic stroke patients without AF and utilize more advanced imaging techniques
(computerized coronary tomography angiography, C-CTA) to define the association of specific LA markers with
stroke subtype, hypothesizing that particular C-CTA parameters will be associated with CES and that these
markers will improve prediction of stroke subtype beyond sTTE alone, and beyond a current trial definition of
atrial cardiopathy (ARCADIA). Understanding the relationship between markers of LA function and stroke
subtype as well as post-stroke outcomes important to the patient will impact clinical practice and aid future
research. This science will be paired with critical training in advanced cardiovascular imaging methods, risk
prediction and cohort and clinical trial methodology. The grant-enabled research, combined with the proposed
training plan, will enable me to successfully advance to an independent career as a physician-scientist."
10897095,"Project Summary: Rates of FDA approval for oncology drugs in clinical trials are low and often clinical trial
failures are driven by pre-screening of therapies in models that cannot adequately replicate patient physiology.
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly complex consisting of multiple cell types including stromal cells,
immune cells and vasculature. The interplay between tumor cells and neighboring cells in the TME results in
environmental changes that can support tumor growth, vascularization and metastasis and, thus, plays an
important role in prognosis and treatment efficacy (e.g. by modulating resistance). It is important for clinical
prescreening models to include the TME to assess how treatment efficacy can be impacted by this multicellular
crosstalk. For men with advanced castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that have progressed to
metastasis, the disease is invariably lethal as current therapies are not curative. 90% of these patients have
developed bone metastases but the bone microenvironment has been historically difficult to model in animal
models or traditional co-culture. Therefore, in vitro models of the bone marrow TME are urgently needed to
improve pre-screening of novel therapeutics, improve clinical trial design, outcomes and expedite much
needed treatments to the clinic. Here we propose to create a tissue chip model of the bone marrow
microenvironment for testing metastatic CRPC therapeutics. Patient-derived prostate tumor spheroids model
the solid tumor embedded in a collagen hydrogel surrounded by multiple resident bone marrow stromal cells
derived from bone marrow aspirates, immune cells and iPSC endothelial cell vasculature. Cell-surface targeted
therapies, such as IMMU-132 have great potential for treatment of metastatic cancers. IMMU-132 is an
antibody drug conjugate, with an antibody against Trop 2, a receptor expressed on tumor cells, coupled to the
drug SN-38. SN-38 is a topoisomerase inhibitor that induced apoptosis in rapidly proliferating cells. We have
access to samples and data from a Phase II trial of IMMU-132 in metastatic CRPC which will allow us to
validate our bone marrow tissue chip model. In the UG3 phase, we will optimize our bone marrow tissue chip
model and demonstrate that normal and disease chip environments replicate the in vivo physiology. We will
also validate the chip for measuring responses to cell surface targeted therapies. In the UH3, we will use
clinical trial data to build tissue chips that represent patients who respond and do not respond to IMMU-132
and validate these models. These chips will be used to determine mechanisms of TME-induced treatment
resistance and identify signatures of response for use in stratifying patients for more efficient clinical trials. The
chips can also be used to screen multiple different cell-surface targeted therapies helping direct therapy choice
in future trials. The bone marrow tissue chips can be easily adapted for any cancer type that has bone
metastases and can measure a range of cell surface targeted therapies. These chips have the potential to be a
powerful tool for improving clinical trial success rates in therapies for metastatic cancer."

The majority of persons with HIV (PWH) in the US consume alcohol, despite that alcohol use is associated with
lower levels of HIV care engagement and HIV viral suppression. Over the past decade, our research team has
established the Florida Cohort to support research and training with a mission to maximize HIV viral
suppression and improve health outcomes in PWH. Key features of the Florida Cohort include a focus on
alcohol-related issues, academic and community-based partnerships across the state, targeted enrollment of
diverse populations, and linkage to statewide HIV surveillance data. Meanwhile, several agencies in Florida
are implementing new interventions to help achieve HIV viral suppression, including the PositiveLinks (PL)
app. The overarching goals of the current grant proposal are to advance understanding of the mechanisms
influencing adherence to contemporary HIV therapeutic regimens, and to incorporate alcohol-related
interventions into emerging strategies to achieve and maintain HIV viral suppression across diverse
populations. We propose to enroll and survey 1200 new Florida Cohort participants, with targeted enrollment
for heavy drinkers and sexual/ethnic minorities. The survey data will allow us to identify multilevel factors
contributing to ART adherence and viral suppression among alcohol-using PWH. From the overall cohort, 80
alcohol-using PWH will complete “enhanced monitoring (EM)” for one month. The EM group will wear a wrist
alcohol biosensor, report alcohol and other risk factors (e.g., real-time anxiety, depression) and ART
adherence through an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) app, and provide two dried blood spots (DBS)
viral load tests. The EM data will help disentangle the temporal relationships between alcohol, other risk
factors, and ART adherence in real-time. Survey and EM data together with input from the EM participants will
be used to inform the development of several aspects of the biosensor-based intervention. Our interdisciplinary
team will also meet regularly with a new Community/Provider Advisory Board (CAB), who will provide input
related to the ongoing Florida Cohort (e.g., enrollment, survey design) and help develop a plan to integrate the
alcohol biosensor-based intervention into the PL app. The specific aims include: 1) Systematically investigate
multilevel factors based on the social-ecological model and WHO model that influence ART adherence and
subsequently HIV viral suppression in alcohol-using vs. non-using PWH. 2) In 80 alcohol-using PWH, use
alcohol biosensors and EMA data to identify alcohol consumption patterns and risk factors most strongly
associated with ART non-adherence and poor HIV viral suppression. 3) Develop an intervention that
incorporates an alcohol biosensor into an existing mHealth ART adherence intervention, with input from
alcohol-using PWH and a Community/Provider Advisory Board. The rich information we collect in this project
will establish a solid foundation for our next step: a hybrid implementation/effectiveness trial of an integrated
alcohol intervention across a large network of clinic-/community-based HIV settings in Florida."

Modern biomedical science and medicine, with large varied and complex datasets, requires a
paradigm shift in our educational models to train the next generation of scientists and physicians
capable of performing and interpreting computational analyses. Current educational models have
created a critical gap of expertise between computational data scientists and disease-oriented
physiologists. The Specific Aim of this proposal is to establish an innovative educational model to
promote the training of computational skills for immediate and direct application to research
experiences and create the next generation of biomedical scientists to lead new discoveries in
diabetes, digestive and kidney disease-oriented research. The Mayo Clinic Research Education
Program in Computational Autonomic Neurobiology is a unique new program designed to ensure
foundational understanding of both computational science and disease-oriented physiology, prior to
learning practical skills in computational methods that are directly applied to data from mentored
research experiences. Participants in the program, including graduate students, post-doctoral fellows,
biomedical engineers, medical residents, and clinical fellows, are recruited widely from existing
educational, training and research programs via the international reputations and productivity of the
highly invested participating faculty. The program leverages institutional resources for program
administration and robust program evaluation to remain adaptive and responsive to the needs of
participants. The short-term objectives of the program are to: 1) provide foundational knowledge in
physiology and computational science; 2) provide practical skill in the use creation and dissemination
of computational workflows; and 3) provide a research environment to enrich skill honing and
productivity. The long-term objectives of the program are to: 4) expand the use and access of
computational analyses to impact diabetes, digestive and kidney disease-oriented research; and 5)
attract and retain diverse scientists that impact the fields of diabetes, digestive and kidney disease-
oriented research. By completing the program, we anticipate these scientists will form a bridge
between the often distant physiological and computational approaches to understand human health
and form a generation of diverse scientists that impact the fields of diabetes, digestive and kidney
diseases."
10897099,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 DNAzymes represent one of the most recent classes of diverse, catalytically active biomolecules. However,
despite their discovery >25 years ago and exceptional potential for broad analytical and therapeutic applications,
our understanding of metallo-DNAzymes in terms of binding selectivity, structure, and catalytic mechanism still
lags far behind that of metalloproteins. Although DNAzymes have already been developed as highly selective
metal ion sensors, the lack of fundamental knowledge regarding metallo-DNAzyme function has precluded the
application of rational design to enhance metal binding affinity and specificity. The goal of this project is to obtain
unparalleled insight into the structure-function relationships of metal-binding DNAzymes specific for redox-active
metal ions (RAMIs) with high physiological relevance (e.g., Fe2+, Fe2+, Cu+, and Cu+2), and in turn provide a
foundation for the future rational design of DNAzymes.
 To achieve this goal, an array of biochemical and advanced biophysical characterization techniques will be
employed and cross-correlated to determine the locations of metal binding, coordination environments, binding
affinities and specificities, and reaction mechanisms for a series of Fe2+, Fe3+, Cu+, and Cu+2-specific DNAzymes.
Metal-bound DNAzyme resting states will be generated using a series of “non-cleavable” substrates, which will
prove fundamental in determining metal binding affinities, specificities, and key spectroscopic signatures using
UV-Vis/nIR, EPR, and 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopies. By additionally applying XAS, the rudimentary
coordination environment and electronic structure will be determined. Single point mutations will be screened
across suspected metal-binding regions of oligonucleotide sequences, and the corresponding cleavage
efficiency and characteristic spectroscopic signatures will be tracked to narrow the assignment of metal-binding
site. Further advanced characterization using vibrational and pulse EPR spectroscopies will be used together
with selectively isotope-labeled residues to provide a precise assignment of metal binding location and
coordination environment. All of this information will be matched by computational modeling of first coordination
binding models using a DFT and ab initio approaches. Lastly, a high-risk/high-reward foray will be made to grow
diffraction-quality crystals for holistic structural characterization. Beyond the resting state, the mechanism of
DNA/RNA cleavage by these DNAzymes will be analyzed by a combined analysis of cleaved fragment ends and
careful kinetic characterization. Where necessary, rapid quench flow and rapid freeze quench methods will be
employed to trap and assess potential reaction intermediates.
 Achieving the above goals will greatly deepen our understanding of the structure and function of metal-
binding sites in DNAzymes, shifting the paradigm of metalloprotein characterization methodology to include
metallo-DNAzymes. These insights are crucial for rational design and computational modeling to be used
effectively in producing the next generation of metal ion-sensing DNAzymes."

Approximately .5% of children are born missing a limb, and 2.1 million in the US alone are living with limb loss.
Current management for these patients largely relies on the use of prostheses, however most prosthetic use is
marked by significant patient dissatisfaction due to functional limitations. Only regeneration of an intact limb
can offer optimal function and quality of life for these patients. While it is well known that select non-
mammalian organisms have remarkable capabilities for complete limb regeneration, it is sometimes
overlooked that similar capacity for regeneration, at least in latent or incomplete form, exists in mammals
including humans and mice. Digit tip amputation in both humans and mice can lead to blastema formation and
composite regeneration of the digit tip. Understanding the mechanism of these mammalian limb regenerative
responses is a necessary step to inducing or extending these responses to promote limb regeneration.
However, methods to achieve this goal have been elusive, in part because the specific stem cells mediating
regenerative blastema formation and organizing the regenerative response were unknown.
 Recently, we have identified a new stem cell forming the skeleton that is specialized for skeletal healing
responses, and we find that these stem cells are the cell of origin of the blastema forming after digit
amputation, undergoing injury induced plasticity that then confers upon them the capability to not only mediate
bone regeneration, but to more over orchestrate a composite tissue regeneration program. We further find that
when this specific stem cell is harvested from blastema tissue and transplanted to a site of tibial amputation,
they the capacity to mediate true limb regeneration at this new site, thereby allowing initiation of a true limb
regeneration response to be initiated at any amputation site. Here, we will develop these observations into a
new approach for limb regeneration, first (Aim 1) we will determine how this stem cell acts in the blastema
forming after digit tip amputation orchestrate multi-tissue regeneration and how these cells are transcriptionally
reprogrammed in the blastema to acquire the capacity to orchestrate regenerative responses. Next (Aim 2), we
will further develop the method of blastema stem cell implantation into amputation sites to initiate regeneration,
evaluating whether the true multi-tissue regeneration occurs at the transplantation site, and whether new joint
tissue can be patterned in the transplanted cells, thereby allowing for true limb reconstruction, including joints.
Ultimately, this proposal will develop key initial elements of a new approach for the regeneration of amputated
limbs, by transducing a specific population of autologous skeletal stem cells to induce a blastema-like state,
and then implanting them into the amputation site to initiate regeneration of the missing limb."
10897042,"There has been an unprecedented increase in the number of refugees worldwide, with approximately 26
million men, women and children forcibly displaced from their homes at the end of 2019. More than half of the
world’s refugees live in dense urban areas or refugee camps in low- and middle-income countries. A smaller
percentage are permanently resettled in high-income countries. Across these contexts, refugees have elevated
rates of common mental disorders. War and forced migration also contribute to systematic disruptions in social
relationships including family separation, tension and conflict, and losses of social networks. There is an
emerging evidence base of models regarding refugees’ mental health and psychosocial needs, but major gaps
exist regarding how to adapt evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to refugee populations and sustain them in
community settings. To address these gaps, my career goal is to establish an independent research program
focused on the implementation of community-based mental health services for refugee communities across the
displacement continuum. In collaboration with community partners, I aim to examine methods for integrating
EBIs into non-traditional service settings to enable refugees’ access to prevention and care interventions that
promote positive mental health outcomes. A central concern my research seeks to address is how to best
mobilize social and family resources to enhance coping and wellbeing. These research priorities are shaped by
my more than fifteen years of clinical practice experience working with war-affected populations in the U.S and
globally, doctoral training at the University of Chicago and early research experiences. This K01 application is
structured to build upon my strengths and develop new knowledge and skills in key areas needed to achieve
my long-term goals. My training aims focus on 1) implementation science methods to adapt, scale up and
sustain EBIs in community settings; 2) the application of human-centered design to community-based refugee
mental health services; and 3) community-based trial design and analysis. With support from an accomplished
multidisciplinary team of mentors, I will apply these skills to a research project that focuses on implementing a
peer-led multiple family group (MFG) prevention intervention called CAFES in two community-based
organizations in Chicago to promote uptake and meet the multi-level needs of refugee families. Using a pilot
randomized type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, the research aims include: 1) Adapting the
multiple family CAFES model for Syrian refugee families and delivery by peer providers in community-based
organizations using the ADAPT-ITT framework and human-centered design methods; 2) Piloting the adapted
CAFES model to assess implementation science domains; and 3) Exploring changes in mental health
outcomes and family and community support and mechanisms of change. Drawing on the new knowledge and
skills and pilot study data obtained from this K01, I will prepare an R01 proposal to further test the model
implementation and effectiveness."

problems in biomedical research using a systems biology approach, which integrates experimental techniques
with computational and mathematical modeling. Trainees will investigate biological systems as dynamic, multi-
scale biological networks that span a wide range of time and length scales from genes to cells and tissues. By
combining innovative coursework with mandatory professional development activities to improve their
communication, leadership, and career self-efficacy, trainees will enter the biomedical workforce and make
significant contributions to systems biology. We seek funding for 5 student slots per year to fund two consecutive
years of the first three years of study per trainee, with Yale funding the remaining year. Trainees will enter the
training program through 9 participating home departments/programs: Biomedical Engineering; Mechanical
Engineering & Materials Science; Computational Biology & Bioinformatics; Cell Biology; Genetics; Molecular,
Cellular, & Developmental Biology; Molecular Biophysics & Biochemistry; Physics; and Applied Physics.
Trainees will develop disciplinary expertise through their home department/program, and systems biology
knowledge through program coursework, featuring evidence-based teaching methods, such as peer-learning
and team science to develop trainees’ ability to collaborate and communicate across disciplines. Additionally,
several courses feature a modular format in which trainers with diverse, but complementary backgrounds, co-
teach. To bring all students to a common level of knowledge, the training program offers primer courses in
mathematics/computer programming and biology. Trainees will complete all training program and departmental
course requirements in the first two years and will join their Ph.D. thesis lab in year one. Therefore, the training
program does not increase the time to the Ph.D. degree. The training program offers professional development
workshops, program-specific internship opportunities, and seminars, pitch competitions, and other activities
aimed at building a cohesive cohort. The training program is closely associated with the Program in Physics,
Engineering and Biology (PEB), Systems Biology Institute, and Quantitative Biology Institute at Yale, which
provide a larger research community for the training program. Yale’s West Campus and PEB will combine
resources to provide 3 additional matching slots, which will allow the training program to support a total of 8
students out of the cohort of 13-15 training grant eligible Ph.D. students per year. The training program has a
vigorous recruitment plan, which includes new and existing college/university partners (e.g. Morehouse College,
University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez, and Southern Connecticut State University) and an NSF REU Site, which
allows the training program leadership to identify promising URM undergraduates interested in systems biology.
Additionally, the program has well-developed tracking and evaluation components to identify and remediate any
problem areas and ensure that the training program objectives are being achieved."

community center (RCC), the PILLARS, located in Harlem, New York City. She completed her Ph.D. in May in
2022 at Fordham University, many years after she has been engaged in providing peer recovery support
services and founding her own RCC. Dr. Pullen has demonstrated interest in and passion for conducting
research in this space, as evidenced by her collaboration on local, state and federally-funded research
projects. These collaborations, however, have not provided her with the opportunity to publish in peer-
reviewed journals, or pursue NIH-level funding on her own. Dr. Bettina Hoeppner will serve as her primary
mentor during her proposed fellowship. The goal of this fellowship is to provide Dr. Pullen with the experience,
training, mentoring, and networking to enable her to conduct her own PI-led NIH-funded research and to
publish her research in scientific journals, while continuing to lead her RCC. The parent grant provides an
ideal context to achieve these goals. Namely, R34 DA057604 is a planning grant that seeks to prepare for a
large-scale effectiveness trial that can test the effectiveness of RCCs. RCCs are recovery-oriented
sanctuaries anchored in the hearts of communities, which provide a range of recovery-oriented, peer-delivered
services. Despite recent rapid largescale investment in their growth, empirical data on their functioning and
outcomes are extremely limited. Thus, our team is engaging in three preparatory studies that can inform the
design and logistics of a planned subsequent rigorous R01-level trial, which will test if linkage from clinics that
provide medications for opioid use disorder (MOUDs) to RCCs will result in improved recovery trajectories for
people using MOUDs. During the proposed fellowship, Dr. Pullen will engage in research activities as part of
the R34 team, including co-authorship on papers, while also engaging in mentored research activities to
advance two specific research projects of her choosing: (1) submitting an NIH grant application on testing the
acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of offering the SKY Recovery program via RCCs; and (2) testing and
publishing findings on the Mixed Method Recovery Capital Assessment Tool (MRCAT) developed by Dr.
Pullen. Additionally, Dr. Pullen will engage in scientific network building activities. Together, these activities
will optimally prepare Dr. Pullen for her next career step to conduct NIH-funded research alongside her active

10897212,"PROJECT SUMMARY-ABSTRACT
 Astrocytes are highly-abundant cells in the nervous system and they play a critical role in the
orchestration of neuronal synaptic networks. One of the primary mechanisms through which they influence
neuronal synapses is thought to involve signaling via a diverse milieu of extracellular proteins (i.e., the astrocyte
matrisome). However, it remains unclear which components of the astrocyte matrisome are necessary and
sufficient for the formation and strengthening of neuronal excitatory synapses, especially in human-specific cells
due to current limitations in experimentally investigating human neural networks using traditional monolayer
cultures and immature organoids. To overcome these technical limitations, we will utilize our recently optimized
approach which generates and analyzes bioengineered neural organoids that are composed of specific numbers
of post-mitotic astrocytes as well as neurons that are directly transdifferentiated from human pluripotent stem
cells. Specifically, we will use these bioengineered neural organoids to test the hypothesis that mature human
astrocytes produce a cell type-restricted, multi-component, activity-dependent matrisome that accelerates the
formation and function of neuronal synaptic networks. Our preliminary data confirms feasibility of our organoid-
based approach to test this hypothesis and has identified top candidate proteins potentially underlying the
astrocyte-to-neuron influence on synapses. In Aim 1, we will determine whether human astrocyte
Thrombospondin 1 protein is a sufficient and necessary inducer of human neuronal synapses. We will use a
combination of genetic engineering and drug treatment to conclude whether Thrombospondin 1 promotes
structural and function excitatory synaptic networks and if it acts through signaling to the neuronal alpha2delta-
1 receptor. In Aim 2, we will define the extracellular human astrocyte matrisome and test its influence upon
neuronal synapse formation using a novel indirect coculture approach. Cocultures will be enabled by cellular
encapsulation within alginate hydrogel capsules to elucidate the extracellular astrocyte matrisome components,
test their effect upon neuronal organoids, and identify relevant receptor-ligand pairs. We will investigate whether
astrocyte-derived extracellular Thrombospondin 1 and/or chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans influences synapse
formation and function. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test how neuronal activity influences the synapse-promoting
characteristics of the human astrocyte matrisome. Neurons will be activated and paced using optogenetic tools,
and the resultant effect on cocultured astrocytes will be determined using a combination of single cell
RNAsequencing, pharmacological treatment, protein assays, and calcium imaging. The completion of our aims
will deliver novel experimental cell lines and protocols to the scientific community, and may identify novel
approaches to accelerate neuronal synaptic network formation in organoid-based model systems. Broadly, we
expect our studies to make significant contributions to the neurobiology field by identifying and defining
intercellular signaling mechanisms between human astrocytes and neuronal synapses."
10897215,"PROJECT SUMMARY
College students are at risk for engaging in heavy alcohol use, affecting academic performance and mental
and physical health. Brief motivational interventions reduce alcohol use and consequences, but intervention
gains decay 3-6 months post-intervention. Mandated college students, who have violated university alcohol
policy, are an important intervention target; they drink more, experience more alcohol-related consequences,
and are less likely to maintain reduced drinking than typical students. To promote student health, brief
motivational interventions need to be improved to promote maintenance of reduced drinking. This K01 outlines
the necessary research and training experiences to prepare the PI to become an independent researcher
focused on developing interventions that promote not only initiation, but also maintenance of reduced drinking
among young adults. Notably, the PI will learn the innovative, engineering-inspired multiphase optimization
strategy (MOST), which uses the factorial experimental design to develop highly efficacious interventions. The
proposed research consists of three stages. First, a systematic review will examine theories of and empirical
research on maintenance of behavior change. This will yield recommendations for mechanisms that are likely
to improve maintenance of reduced alcohol use among young adults. In the subsequent stages, all participants
will be mandated students who receive a brief motivational intervention, providing a context for studying
maintenance-enhancing constructs and intervention strategies. In the second stage, the utility of constructs for
predicting maintenance will be examined in 475 mandated students, followed 1-, 3-, and 6-months post-
intervention. Constructs proposed by two prominent models of maintenance—coping motives, parent-student
communication, maintenance self-efficacy, and recovery self-efficacy—in addition to promising constructs
identified in the systematic review, will be examined as predictors of maintenance trajectories. Third,
intervention strategies targeting identified maintenance enhancement constructs will be developed and pilot
tested for acceptability among 60 mandated students; a mandated-specific parent handbook will be piloted
among 20 of their parents. A pilot optimization trial will also be conducted with 80 mandated students and their
parents. Students will be randomly assigned to one of up to 16 conditions in a factorial experimental design.
Results of the proposed research will yield important information on the factors that promote maintenance of
reduced alcohol use, supporting subsequent grant applications to further develop a maintenance-enhancement
intervention. The PI will work with a highly skilled mentoring team (Drs. Kate Carey, Katie Witkiewitz, Linda
Collins, Rebecca Spencer) to gain expertise in: 1) maintenance of behavior change theories; 2) intervention
development; 3) MOST; 4) management and analysis of longitudinal research; 5) grant writing. The research
and training activities proposed in this K01 will produce both an independent research scientist and important
scientific knowledge on maintenance of health behavior change, an understudied topic."
10895123,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as a modifiable risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD). As such, there has been an explosion of interest in the link between TBI and the development of late neurodegenerative pathologies, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy neuropathologic change (CTE-NC). However, the intense focus on CTE-NC has come at the expense of investigation of the broader spectrum of pathologies found after all forms of TBI. Accordingly, we have adopted the conceptual framework, “TBI-related neurodegeneration” (TReND), of which CTE-NC is just one form. Notably, studies in TBI offer a unique opportunity to discover mechanisms of neurodegeneration, since the initiating event or events – ‘time zero’- are known, thereby permitting the temporal examination of the progression of pathology. Indeed, for over two decades, our group has led the meticulous description of multiple neurodegenerative pathologies in individuals with a history of repetitive mild TBI or single severe TBI. In 2019, we established a NINDS-supported U54 center without walls, CONNECT-TBI, which has become internationally recognized for its success in coordinating prospective tissue banking in TBI, across all injury severities and exposures. To date, CONNECT-TBI has gathered unrivaled clinical datasets and tissue archives, including over 1000 prospectively collected cases across participating centers. Here, as we enter our final year of U54 support for CONNECT-TBI, we propose the next phase initiative; “Transdisciplinary Research Accelerating Neuropathology Studies and Facilitating Open Research Methods in TBI” (TRANSFORM-TBI). This initiative seeks to continue and expand the CONNECT-TBI Archive, which we will leverage to explore relationships between TReND, pathologies of AD/ADRD, and their contribution to late clinical outcomes. We also propose to democratize access to this resource to accelerate the discovery of TReND pathologies and their significance. In so doing, we have established an expert, multidisciplinary team of 26 investigators across 12 sites who will identify associations between the extent and type of neuropathological changes emerging following exposure to TBI of all severities (repetitive mild to single severe) and exposures (including sports, military, intimate partner violence). These neuropathological findings will then be compared with extensive clinical datasets to assess potential clinical correlations. Specifically, we aim to, 1) Explore the pathologic heterogeneity of TReND, including the prevalence and spectrum of AD/ADRD pathologies in late survival from TBI, 2) Characterize TReND-associated glial pathology and contrast it with the glial pathology of wider AD/ADRD, 3) Examine TReND associated clinical phenotypes and their distinction from those of aging and wider, non-TBI related AD/ADRD, and 4) Establish a Digital Slide Archive and Open Research Environment (Digital SCOPE) to support innovative, investigator-led studies across the global research community."
10897220,"Development and Validation of a Virtual Bariatric Endoscopic (ViBE) Simulator
Abstract
Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, multifactorial, and neurobehavioral disease that requires life-long,
multidisciplinary management beyond a single intervention. The current treatment options for patients with
morbid obesity include pharmacotherapy, which only induces suboptimal weight loss, and bariatric surgery,
utilized only by a small fraction of the eligible patients. Endoscopic Sleeve Gastroplasty (ESG) is rapidly
emerging as a new tool to combat the obesity epidemic used both as (i) primary weight loss procedure
and (ii) endoscopic revision for patients experiencing weight gain following surgery. It is a safe and effective,
incision-less, non-surgical technique performed with a flexible endoscope, introduced through the mouth,
which reduces the gastric volume by placing full-thickness sutures from within the gastric lumen. It is a one-day
outpatient procedure with rapid return to work. However, learning to perform ESG is technically
demanding, with a minimum of 35 cases necessary to attain basic proficiency. Though endoscopic
suturing skills are critical for ESG, just learning endoscopic suturing is not sufficient for performing ESG.
 With no formal curriculum or competency standards in place for ESG outside the patient-centric
apprenticeship model of medical and procedural education, it is anticipated that a virtual reality (VR)-based
trainer, with visual and haptic (touch) feedback, will be invaluable for training in ESG, allowing trainees to attain
competence in a controlled environment with no risk to patients; to enable customized learning, and to offer
real-time feedback, mentoring and objective assessment. The goal of the present proposal is to design,
develop and validate a Virtual Bariatric Endoscopic (ViBE) simulator that can be used to train
endoscopic bariatric procedures such as ESG. Significant technical innovations of this project include (1)
developing realistic physics-based real-time simulations of the ESG procedure, including an efficient
constrained spline dynamics (CSD) algorithm for modeling endoscopic suturing, (2) an innovative hardware
interface for accurate force feedback during ESG, (3) in vivo porcine experiments to characterize the
endoscopic suturing procedure; and (4) a cognitive assistant module, based on detailed cognitive task
analysis, to provide real-time feedback to the trainee. We will conduct experiments on voluntarily enrolled
participants to ensure that appropriate skills are being learned on the ViBE and performance measured on the
ViBE reflects the appropriate technical skills. Further, we will test the hypothesis that trainees who train on
the ViBE simulator will learn at the same rate or better than those trained on ex vivo porcine
gastrointestinal specimens and that this training will transfer to the clinical environment.
 The significance of this project is that it focuses on the obesity epidemic and proposes to develop a
simulator to enable the safe adoption of ESG. Endoscopic suturing skills learned on the ViBE will translate to
other endoscopic procedures, e.g., stent fixation and management of bariatric surgical complications."
10897221,"SOCS1 is a crucial regulator for uveal melanoma response to immunotherapy
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Targeted and immune therapies generated remarkable clinical responses in cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients.
However, uveal melanoma (UM) is among those cancer types that have benefited little or not at all from targeted
therapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). Currently, there is no FDA-approved systemic therapy for
patients with metastatic UM. The mechanism underlying poor response to CPIs in UM is unclear. There is an
urgent need to develop effective prognostic markers and immunotherapies for UM patients. To characterize the
immunosuppressive mechanisms in UM, we initiated a study of immune profiling UM tumors derived from
patients treated with CPIs. Our preliminary data showed that the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1)
was significantly higher in pre-treatment tumors of responders than nonresponders. Moreover, SOCS1 is
correlated with UM patients′ survival and most major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules′ expressions.
SOCS1 is a known prominent regulator of cytokine signaling and tumor microenvironment. To date, a major gap
lies in our understanding of the functional role of SOCS1 in UM. Herein, we hypothesize that SOCS1 is a crucial
factor regulating the immune infiltrates and tumor immunogenicity of UM via promoting MHC molecules’
expression. Markedly, the suppression of SOCS1 underlies the poor response to immune CPIs in UM, and
upregulation of SOCS1 in tumors can overcome this drug resistance. Thus, we propose the following specific
aims of preclinical translational research to investigate the role of SOCS1 in immune-silent UM tumors. Aim 1)
To characterize the SOCS1-associated immune signature of UM that correlates with the patient's clinical
response to immune CPIs. Aim 2) To investigate the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms suppressing
SOCS1 and MHC expressions in immune cold UM cells. Aim 3) To enhance the immune response in UM tumors
by SOCS1 modulators and further examine their antitumor effects in combination with CPIs. In this project, the
levels and function of various immune infiltrates related to SOCS1 will be profiled in UM tumors. We will identify
a distinct SOCS1-associated immune signature that can be a predictive marker for UM patient’s response to
CPIs and overall survival. Moreover, by unveiling the signaling pathways or factors suppressing SOCS1 and
MHC expressions in UM, we expect to identify novel drug targets to upregulate the expressions of these genes,
which will convert an immune cold into a hot tumor. For the first time, we will investigate a novel strategy to
combine small modulators that can upregulate SOCS1 expression with CPIs to enhance the anticancer immunity
of cytotoxic T cells against UM tumors. The proposed studies are expected to produce data to address one
unmet need for developing effective targeted and immune therapies for UM. This project has great translational
potential and long-term applicability to other forms of cancers, such as immune-resistant CM, head and neck
cancer, breast cancer, and liver cancer, in which SOCS1 is known to be significantly correlated with patients'
overall survival."

conduct basic, clinical and translational research on the mechanisms and treatment of neurological disorders.
This Neuroscience Research Education Program at Northwestern (R25) is designed to foster the development
of clinician neuroscientists in the Departments of Neurology and Pediatrics (Neurology Division) at
Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine (NUFSM) via research and educational experiences
that will prepare these trainees to successfully compete for individual fellowships and mentored career
development awards that would enhance their ability to become independent investigators. We have
demonstrated success in mentorship of our prior trainees both of whom have received K08 awards, and we
plan to continue and expand the program
Specifically, we propose to: 1. Recruit at least one neurology resident each year who demonstrates aptitude for
and interest in research to prepare them to compete for K08 or K23 awards. 2.Continue to implement a
research-training curriculum for the later years of the neurology residency and the first year of clinical
neuroscience research fellowships. The program will continue to utilize established programs and
institutional resources at Northwestern in conjunction with the mentoring teams comprised of a Primary
Mentor and Collaborating faculty. 3. Enhance the opportunity for trainees within the R25 program to utilize
additional existing research mentorship opportunities available at Northwestern. 4. Conduct an ongoing
evaluation of the R25 program.
Northwestern has excellent institutional resources including an NIH funded Clinical and Translational Science
Institute, a NeuroNEXT consortium Center, an outstanding cadre of Neurology and Collaborating faculty with
extensive track record of mentorship, a strong pool of trainees interested in research career, and a rich culture
of interdepartmental collaborations to assure success of the trainees in preparation for independent research
careers.
As was done in the first cycle, at least one trainee will be selected from the pool of neurology residents, and an
individual training plan will created for each trainee. The training team will consist of the Primary Mentor and
collaborating faculty with direct supervision and oversight by the Program Directors. Trainees will be assured at
least six months of protected research time with 80% time dedicated to research during residency, and up to
24 months dedicated to research during fellowship. Success of the program will be determined by the number
of trainees who receive career development awards and ultimately continue with academic careers. The quality
of the program will continue to be evaluated on a regular basis."
10897287,"Project Summary
Mechanisms that drive the development of autoreactive B cells in an autoimmune disorder systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE) is incompletely understood. Overall goal of the Rahman lab is to delineate the
mechanisms that promote the development of autoreactive B cells, autoantibody production and SLE, a
debilitating autoimmune disease that affects millions of Americans and people worldwide. Developing a
complete understanding of such mechanisms will help develop targeted therapies that would be preferable to
currently available SLE treatment options that globally suppress the immune system, and result in recurrent
infections and increase disease-associated morbidity and mortality. GWAS studies have identified risk variants
in the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) gene, which increase the risk of developing SLE. IRF7 is the key
transcription factor that regulates type I interferon (T1-IFN) response downstream of nucleic acid sensing toll-
like receptor (TLR) that promote SLE in mice and humans. Our preliminary data highlight the significance of
IRF7 in autoreactive B cell development and SLE manifestations in a well-characterized FcgRIIB-/- SLE model.
Published and preliminary data from the FcgRIIB-/- model indicate a critical role for IRF7 and a modest role for
T1-IFN signaling in autoimmune responses and SLE development. These data suggest T1-IFN-dependent and
-independent roles of IRF7 in autoreactive B cell and SLE development, and point to IRF7 as a potentially
better therapeutic target for SLE than T1-IFN blocking therapies alone, although recent clinical trials for T1-IFN
receptor blocking therapy showed promising outcome. However, we know little about the cell type-specific role
of IRF7 in SLE development, although its role in T1-IFN production by pDCs is well established. Importantly, B
cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic roles of IRF7 in autoreactive B cell development via extrafollicular antibody-forming
cell (AFC) and follicular germinal center (GC) pathways in SLE are not known. Also, T1-IFN-independent IRF7
role in SLE remains unknown. We hypothesize that IRF7 regulates B cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic, and T1-IFN-
dependent and -independent mechanisms in autoreactive B cell development in the AFC and GC pathways,
leading to pathogenic autoantibody production and SLE. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data
showing 1) a significant upregulation of IRF7 in AFCs (plasmablasts/plasma cells), GC B cells and myeloid
cells 2) increased IRF7 expression in activated B cells from SLE patients 3) a drastic reduction in autoimmune
AFC and GC responses, autoantibodies and immune complex deposition in SLE-prone FcgRIIB-/- mice deficient
in IRF7 4) IRF7 involvement in altered B cell metabolic activity in SLE-prone B cells, and published data
revealing 5) a role for IRF7 in mouse and human SLE. The current proposal will help determine B cell-intrinsic
and -extrinsic roles and mechanisms by which IRF7 promote autoreactive B cell and SLE development, and
whether IRF7 could be a better therapeutic option for SLE than T1-IFN or T1-IFN-receptor blocking alone."
10897117,"Project Summary
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in immunity and
autoimmunity, although many miRNAs remain poorly characterized. One such miRNA, miRNA-21 (miR-21), is
upregulated in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and promotes various diseases in mouse models.
These include experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), asthma, cancer, and our findings on its role
in toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7)-driven SLE in mice. We found that TLR7 overexpressing SLE-prone B6.Sle1bYaa
mice deficient in miR-21 (Sle1bYaamiR-21-/-) had reduced germinal center (GC) B cell, T follicular helper (Tfh)
cell and plasma cell (PC) responses. These responses in Sle1bYaamiR-21-/- mice were strongly associated with
reduced autoantibody, and splenic and bone marrow autoantibody-producing antibody forming cell (AFC)
responses. These data substantiate a role for miR-21 in the loss of B cell tolerance and autoimmunity, which
necessitates identification of mechanisms (focus of the grant) by which miR-21 promotes autoantibody
production and SLE. This will fill gaps in knowledge and may help discover an urgently needed targeted
therapy for SLE, a debilitating disease that affects millions of Americans and people world-wide. TLR signaling,
especially TLR7, promotes SLE in humans and murine models, and an attractive therapeutic target. TLR7
signaling activates the NF-kB inflammatory signaling pathway. TLR7 upregulates miR-21 expression in B cells
which can target the negative regulator of NF-kB signaling, Peli1, although the role of miR-21 in regulating NF-
kB signaling in SLE-prone B cells by targeting Peli1 is unknown. Preliminary data showed that B cells from
Sle1bYaamiR-21-/- mice have increased Peli1 expression compared to control Sle1bYaa B cells. In addition,
previous studies implicated TLR signaling in metabolic reprogramming, primarily through the activation of the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in various immune conditions, although the role of this pathway in TLR7-mediated
metabolic reprograming in B cells in SLE is not clear. miR-21 was also shown to regulate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway in various models; however, its role in regulating B cell metabolism in TLR7-driven SLE is not known.
Interestingly, our RNA-seq analysis of B cells from a TLR7-induced model showed negatively enriched genes
in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in the absence of miR-21. Additional preliminary data showed increased
extracellular acidification (ECAR) and oxygen consumption (OCR) rates in Sle1bYaa B cells overexpressing
TLR7 compared to Sle1b B cells, indicating a more energetic phenotype in response to TLR7 signaling.
Conversely, Sle1bYaamiR-21-/- B cells exhibited reduced ECAR and OCR compared to Sle1bYaa B cells. We
hypothesize that miR-21 promotes TLR7-driven systemic autoimmune responses and SLE disease by
regulating TLR7-NF-kB signaling and metabolic reprogramming in B cells. Proposed hypothesis and specific
aims will help delineate the mechanism by which miR-21 drives autoimmune responses and lupus nephritis
and will inform us whether miR-21 or miR-21 regulated pathway(s) can be a therapeutic target for SLE."
10897120,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a critical need to identify important parameters involved in adaptation to environmental stresses in fungal
biofilms, in order to develop effective therapeutic strategies against fungal infections. Treatment of fungal
infections by Candida spp, including the emerging pathogen Candida glabrata (C. glabrata), remains a clinical
challenge especially in immunocompromised individuals. C. glabrata is now the second most frequently isolated
Candida spp in North America. In vivo, microbes mostly exist in biofilms, which serve as protective layers. Cells
in biofilms exhibit increased resistance to environmental stresses. Since biofilms are an integral part of
pathogenesis, the adaptation of fungal pathogens inside a biofilm is an important aspect that requires a deeper
understanding. However, existing knowledge of fungal adaptation in biofilms is limited, partly due to the lack of
established experimental methods for the long-term propagation of fungal biofilms. With a long-term goal of
contributing to the development of therapeutic strategies for candidiasis, the overall objective of the project is to
develop a fungal biofilm propagation method for use in experimental adaptive evolution, and to apply the system
to identify essential genes involved in C. glabrata biofilms. In Aim 1, a biofilm culture system suitable for long-
term in vitro evolution will be developed and characterized. A key feature of the method being developed is the
ability to grow multiple biofilms from the same seed biofilm, allowing multiple procedures for analysis and
characterization of biofilms at each passage during in vitro evolution. Aim 2 will Implement the fungal biofilm
propagation system for in vitro evolution of C. glabrata to environmental stressors. Key properties, such as
amount of biofilm formation and changes in biofilm structure will be monitored. Molecular mechanisms
associated with adaptation to environmental stressors in fungal biofilms will be elucidated based on genome-
sequencing and phenotypic analyses. Aim 3 will combine the biofilm propagation method with transposon
sequencing to identify essential genes involved in biofilm formation in C. glabrata. The method being developed
can be broadly applied to other microbial pathogens to better identify how pathogens adapt and evolve in a more
host-relevant environment, and enables the identification of potential therapeutic strategies against difficult-to-
treat biofilms. This R16 will fund the research of approximately 20 undergraduates (UGs) over four years,
including many minority trainees. UGs will perform the majority of the proposed work, with training and
mentorship from a technician and the PI. This funding would allow the PI to continue to develop a strong track
record in research, give meaningful research experiences to underrepresented minority students, and enhance
the research capacity at San Jose State University."
10868104,"Mouse models of Fuchs corneal endothelial dystrophy
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) affects 4% of people over age 40 in the USA and is more prevalent
in woman than men. Corneal endothelial (CE) cells control the hydration of the cornea necessary for its
transparency. In FECD there is thickening of Descemet’s membrane (DM) with formation of DM deposits called
guttae and CE cell death leading to corneal edema. Regardless of the specific mutation associated with FECD
a common characteristic is mitochondrial dysfunction leading to oxidative stress and apoptosis. The Col8a2
knock in (KI) mouse presents guttae but not mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) or corneal edema. A
second model of acute UV irradiation induces ROS, cell death and guttae but does not recapitulate the slow
FECD clinical course. Hence, the available models are not a complete representation of FECD. We have
previously observed that SOD2 knock down in CE cells in vitro leads to increased ROS production and apoptosis.
Our hypothesis is that addition of mitochondrial ROS in the Col8a2 model will provide a better representation of
human FECD.
In aim 1A&B Sod2 flox mice are crossed with mice expressing Estrogen receptor-Cre recombinase fusion protein
(CreERT). Upon Tamoxifen induction Sod2 KO is produced. We expect to see oxidative stress, guttae and
corneal edema before 1 year of age. In aim 1C we will induce Sod2 KO in Col8a2 KI mice. We anticipate an
acceleration of the appearance of guttae and the decrease in CE density leading to edema before 1 year of age.
In aim 2 we will generate a CE-predominant inducible KO system. In aim 2A we will generate a KI mouse (Col8a2-
IRES-rtTA) that contains an internal ribosome entry site followed by a reverse tetracycline transcription activator
coding sequence right after the stop codon of Col8a2 gene. It will be expected that Col8a2 and rtTA will be
translated from the same mRNA. These mice will be crossed with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the
tetracycline response element (TetO-CRE) and with Tomato-Green reporter mice (mT/mG). Hence, in Col8a2-
IRES-rtTA//TetO-CRE//mT/mG mice after Doxycycline (Dox) treatment, green fluorescence is expected only in
the CE and not in corneal epithelium and keratocytes. In aim 2B we will create a CE-specific inducible Sod2 KO
by Dox induction in mice of the genotype Col8a2-IRES-rtTA// TetO-CRE// Sod2 flox/flox. In this model we expect
a phenotype like the one described for specific aim1A&B. Establishing a good FECD model in mice will facilitate
the study of the pathological events and enable testing medical therapies. The generation of a CE-specific
inducible KO system will further facilitate the study of pathways of disease and the creation of new corneal
endothelial dystrophy models."
10868105,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease that primarily affects the striatum, a brain region
that controls movement and some forms of cognition. Patients manifest a myriad of motor, cognitive, and
neuropsychiatric symptoms, the latter being the most burdensome. Apathy is the most prevalent
neuropsychiatric symptom in HD and is strongly associated with cognitive dysfunction and suicide, which is
the third most common cause of death in HD. The treatment of apathy should be a priority in the clinical
care of HD patients, but the etiology or pathophysiology of apathy in HD is unknown. The goal of this
proposal is to fill this gap in knowledge and provide insights into the cellular mechanisms that regulate
apathy in HD. This is crucial to develop effective treatments to prevent unnecessary deaths and improve
the quality of life of HD patients. Studies in the general population have shown that systemic inflammation
and white matter (WM) lesions are risk factors for apathy. Increased inflammation and WM atrophy are
found in the striatum of patients and mouse models of HD and we and others have shown that dysfunction
of striatal astrocytes in HD plays a critical role in these processes. Astrocyte dysfunction has previously
been associated with mood disorders, but whether striatal astrocytes regulate apathy in HD is unknown.
We recently showed that a subpopulation of striatal reactive astrocytes expressing the glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP+), but not other known astrocyte markers, are clustered around a subset of axon bundles
(WM fascicles) traversing the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of a mouse model of HD (zQ175), a
phenomenon that increased with disease severity. The DMS along with regions of the medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC) are interconnected and regulate motivation-related behaviors such as apathy. Based on this
evidence we hypothesize that a specialized population of GFAP+ astrocytes accumulate on WM fascicles
derived from the mPFC and traversing the DMS in HD, causing WM atrophy and apathy related behaviors.
To test this hypothesis, we will conduct three complementary aims: Aim 1) we will identify the origin of WM
fascicles associated with GFAP+ astrocytes in the DMS of HD mice using anterograde viral tracing
analyses from injections conducted in different cortical regions and GFAP immunostaining analyses, Aim
2) we will characterize the astrocytes associated with WM in the DMS of HD mice using coupled spatial
transcriptomics and proteomic analyses using the Nanostring nCounter system, and Aim 3) elucidate the
effect of ablating WM associated striatal astrocytes in the regulation of WM atrophy and apathy by using an
astrocyte selective viral expression of the diphtheria toxin fragment A in the DMS of HD mice. Successful
completion of this proposal may reveal a new mechanistic connection between WM atrophy, striatal gliosis,
and apathy in HD and will serve the basis for future functional characterization analyses of WM-associated
astrocytes to start uncovering new ways to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD."
10867783,"Project Summary/Abstract
The lack of accessible, individual-level measurements suited to inform clinical decision-making is a critically
unmet need in depression, the leading cause of disability globally. Persistent cognitive impairments from
depression are a major contributor to disability. Our objective is to optimize, validate, and deploy a clinical
cognitive signature using behavioral measures that have a basis in neural mechanisms, enabling individualized
assessment at scale suited to personalized clinical prognostic and treatment selection decisions. We will extend
our pioneering work in identifying a cognitive phenotype of depression derived from computerized behavioral
‘WebNeuro’ tasks that align with the RDoC cognitive control construct, to be complemented by a novel, research-
based smartphone ‘BiAffect’ application for finer-grained, passively sampled behavioral metrics. In Aim 1, we
will optimize a clinical cognitive signature for individual-level predictions based on our already identified cognitive
phenotype. We leverage our unique, large existing multi-modal datasets with common cognitive data elements
totaling 3,082 diverse participants. These datasets span participants with major depressive disorder assessed
pre-post treatment with pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapy, pre-post naturalistic trajectories, and matched
healthy participants from the same sites. We will systematically optimize a clinical cognitive signature by
generating trial-by-trial individualized scores on cognitive control tasks, with refined norms, and evaluate these
scores in predictive models. We will also refine the mechanistic understanding of the clinical cognitive signature
in the subset of participants who also have neuroimaging data. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the clinical cognitive
signature in combination with digital phenotyping at scale in a new prospective sample of 1,200 adults with
depression, to be recruited remotely and representative of racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse
population. We will complement WebNeuro with the BiAffect technology, both suited for remote administration,
to quantify finer-grained individual variations in behavior throughout the day. This new cohort will complete repeat
assessments for symptom and disability outcome predictions over 8 weeks with a 6-month follow-up. In Aim 3,
we will validate the clinical cognitive signature for prospective stratification in a randomized clinical trial with
160 participants from the Stanford Bay Area and Chicago sites. We will prospectively identify participants with a
prominent clinical cognitive signature (designated as C+) and those with a relative absence of the signature
(designated as C-). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive sertraline plus guanfacine or sertraline plus
placebo. Guanfacine is chosen because it has been shown to ameliorate cognitive deficits in depression based
on the published preliminary findings from our team. The expected end product will be a clinically validated
cognitive signature using a behavioral assessment tool that can be readily scaled and translated into routine
clinical practice to inform prognostic and tailored treatment decisions. The project will generate a unique FAIR-
compliant dataset enabling future scaling using machine learning and AI."
10866936,"In the United States, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related deaths, with
only 20.5% of the 5-year overall survival rate. Low lung cancer survival rates reflect the large
proportion of patients (57%) diagnosed with distant metastases, for which the 5-year relative
survival rate is 5%. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLCs) is the most common type, representing
85% of lung cancer cases. Twenty to forty percent of NSCLC patients develop brain metastasis at
or within a short period of primary tumor diagnosis. The glycan Sialyl Lewis X (SLeX) expression is
increased in cancer cells compared to normal epithelial cells due to tumor hypoxia. Clinical studies
have shown that patients with tumors expressing high levels of SLeX have a significantly higher risk
of developing invasion and metastasis than patients with tumors expressing low levels of this
antigen. We show for the first time that SSL11 mediates cell motility arrest by inducing adhesion via
binding to SLeX. The properties of binding glycan SLeX and inhibiting cell motility of SSL11 make it
an appealing delivery platform against cancers that overexpress SLeX. Pseudomonas exotoxin A
(PE) is an ADP-ribosylating AB toxin used to construct immunotoxins targeting cancers with
antibodies replacement of the receptor-binding domain of PE. A 24 kDa truncated form of PE
(PE24) was fused to a variety of immunotoxins to inactivate eEF-2 in cancer cells, which has shown
promising results against multiple cancers. We hypothesize that a fusion protein SSL11-PE24
composed of SSL11 and PE24 will provide a novel therapy against cancers overexpressing SLeX.
For proof of principle, we will test whether the SSL11-PE24 exhibits anticancer activities in human
lung cancers. We will engineer the fusion protein SSL11-PE24 and characterize its glycan-binding
specificity (aim 1). We will explore the in vitro anticancer effects of SSL11-PE24 in human lung
cancer cells overexpressing SLeX (aim 2). The outcome of this study will provide a potential novel
therapeutic approach based on bacterial toxins against cancers, especially cancers prone to
metastasis."

 (Core C)
Bioinformatics Core
Core C: The Bioinformatics Core, will provide bioinformatics analyses of Next-generation sequence (NGS) data
such as bulk RNA-seq, single cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, as well as proteomics and metabolomics
analyses. Core C will also integrate the newly generated experimental data with public available datasets, use
the state-of-the-art computational models to investigate the combined data and provide a platform for the
generation of new hypotheses of novel genes and pathways for promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation and
cardiac regeneration. Core C will help each project to design their NGS / proteomics / metabolomics experiments,
and discuss the analysis, interpret the experimental results and provide new data which will serve as a platform
for hypotheses and future experiments. These services are best centralized given their inherent difficulty, their
reliance on sophisticated analysis skills and expertise, and requirement of consistency and reproducibility. There
are two specific aims (SAs) for studies that will be pursued in Core C: SA 1: To organize and analyze
computational datasets from transcriptional and proteomic studies performed by the respective projects
and integrate them with existing publicly available datasets. SA 2: To develop new algorithms that will
facilitate the discovery of novel genes and factors that will impact cardiomyocyte proliferation and
remuscularization. These aims will make the bioinformatics analysis easy to reproduce, accessible and
interpretable to each project led team and produce high-quality and in-depth analysis for large-scale NGS,
proteomics and metabolomics data. Core C personnel are well-trained in all aspects of the services to be
provided, as we have collaborated on bioinformatics projects over the past ten year period at UMN and as
members of programmatic projects. All of the required equipment and resources are in place for the proposed

10889741,"Project summary: The overarching goals of this project are to image human white-matter circuitry ex vivo with
cutting-edge technologies, including ultra-high gradient-strength diffusion MRI (dMRI) and direct
measurements of axonal orientations with polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT); and
use the microscopic-scale PS-OCT data to inform the development of more accurate algorithms for
reconstructing brain circuitry from mesoscopic-scale dMRI. In the previous funding cycle, we constructed a
unique, 48-channel receive array coil for imaging whole human brains on the 3T Connectome MRI scanner
with high sensitivity at sub-mm resolution; we blocked human brains and imaged small samples with even
higher-resolution dMRI in a pre-clinical scanner; and we compared the mesoscopic diffusion orientation
estimates obtained from different q-space sampling schemes and reconstruction methods to microscopic
measurements of in-plane axonal orientations from PS-OCT. This work provided us with several insights on
the fiber configurations that are most challenging to dMRI techniques, as well as the relative contribution of
acquisition parameters such as spatial and angular resolution to the accuracy of dMRI. In the next funding
cycle, we propose to extend this work in ways that will allow us to use the optical microscopy data not only to
assess the accuracy of existing dMRI analysis methods, but also to engineer the next generation of methods.
First, we will use a modified PS-OCT setup that will allow us to measure not only in-plane but 3D orientations.
Second, we will extend our ex vivo dMRI data acquisition to allow microstructural modeling, and we will use the
ground-truth axonal orientations from PS-OCT to investigate whether MR-based microstructural indices are
continuous along axon bundles and different between bundles, i.e., to test the basic premise of microstructure-
guided tractography. Third, we will use the dMRI and PS-OCT data to train models for classifying different fiber
configurations (crossing, branching, turning, etc) directly from dMRI. The ultimate goal of the proposed data
acquisition and algorithmic development is to explore alternative (model-based or model-free) approaches to
tackling the ambiguities that lead to errors in conventional dMRI tractography methods. This project will take
advantage of the cutting-edge imaging technologies available at the MGH Martinos Center, and an
investigative team with complementary expertise in tractography, microstructural analysis, and optics. The PI
has a track record of developing open-source software tools and, during the previous cycle, spearheaded the
IronTract Challenge, with the participation of tractography developers from 20 institutions worldwide. We will
continue these practices of sharing software and data, as well as engaging the research community, during the
next cycle. The proposed work will produce (i) a unique set of post mortem MRI and optical imaging data that
can provide new insights on the relationship between fiber architectures and dMRI signals, and (ii) novel
algorithms that can take advantage of these data to improve the reconstruction of brain circuitry from dMRI."
10889802,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a devastating and invariably fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by an
abnormal expansion of polyglutamine repeat in the protein called huntingtin (Htt). HD is characterized by
progressive loss of selective neurons in the striatum and cortex, but the precise mechanisms underlying neuronal
dysfunction and death are not fully understood, and no disease-modifying treatment is currently available. Thus,
there is an urgent need to identify critical therapeutic targets and establish effective neuroprotective treatments
for HD. One of the major challenges in developing effective treatments lies in the complexity of the brain and our
incomplete mechanistic understanding of the disease, The brain comprises diverse cell types, each with distinct
vulnerabilities in HD, which complicates treatment approaches. Understanding the individual responses of these
brain cell types to the treatment would be crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of the treatment.
Transcriptional dysregulation is one of the early molecular abnormalities found in the course of HD and is thought
to play a central role in disease pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggests that genome-wide perturbations
of DNA methylation may drive alterations in gene expression in HD. The fundamental objective of this proposal
is to determine the effect of a DNA demethylating agent on gene expression, behavior, and pathology of HD in
vivo using two different mouse models. The molecular impact of the treatment on individual cell types in the brain,
including neurons and glial cells, in particular, in the striatum, the most vulnerable brain region in HD, will be
determined. The underlying hypothesis is that treatment with the hypomethylating agent protects HD brain by
inhibiting specific DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional alterations critical for neuronal function and survival,
thereby attenuating disease progression. Importantly, therapeutic manipulation of DNA methylation has not been
clinically used for neurodegenerative diseases, including HD. To test our hypothesis, the following specific aims
will be pursued: 1) Determine the impact of a DNA methylation inhibitor on altered gene expression in individual
cell types in HD mouse brains and 2) Determine the effectiveness of the DNA methylation inhibitor on behavior
and pathology of HD mice. Given that both neurons and glia contribute to HD pathogenesis, it is crucial to
understand the transcriptional responses of individual brain cell types to the treatment. The impact of the
demethylating agent in multiple cell types in the striatum of HD model mice will be determined by innovative
single-nucleus RNA-seq analysis. If successful, the proposed study will lay the foundation for the development
of a new class of disease-modifying treatment for HD. It will also provide a mechanistic understanding of
neuroprotection in vivo by this manipulation."
10889835,"The emergence of antibiotic resistance poses a global medical threat. The discovery of new antibiotics from
naturally-occurring secondary metabolites or from high-throughput screening of chemical libraries has failed to
match the pace of resistance mechanisms. Therefore, new approaches for rapidly developing antibiotics are
required to address this global medical need. We propose to integrate computational peptide design, deep
learning, and high-throughput chemical synthesis to create a general framework for the structure-guided
design of new antibiotics. Our recent advances in physics-based and deep-learning-based peptide design
algorithms enable the design of structured peptide macrocycles with atomic-level accuracy. We will extend and
implement these computational methods to design inhibitors of a validated target for antibiotics — the bacterial
type I signal peptidase (SPase I). The secretion and correct folding of critical extracellular and periplasmic
proteins in gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial requires the cleavage of their preproteins by SPase I.
Naturally-occurring inhibitors of SPase I, arylomycins, show a limited spectrum of activity due to sequence
variations in SPase I from different pathogenic bacteria. We propose to implement parallel strategies to design
broad-spectrum inhibitors of SPase I. In one strategy, we will leverage the promising interactions between
arylomycin and conserved regions of the SPase I active site as starting points and extend these interactions
into macrocyclic inhibitors by sampling different backbone conformations and amino acid sequences inside the
SPase active site. In a parallel de novo design approach, we will first identify promising docked conformations
of individual amino acids to the SPase I pocket and then graft those interactions on pre-enumerated and
predesigned sets of millions of structured cyclic peptides. The de novo design approach will be more widely
applicable and enable targeting proteins that do not yet have a natural inhibitor identified. We will filter the tens
of millions of computational models in silico to find the best design models for experimental validation. The
promising design models will be chemically synthesized and screened for binding to SPase I as a massively
parallel macrocycle library with tens of thousands of members. We will further test the
computationally-designed macrocycles for SPase I binding, inhibition of the proteolytic activity, inhibition of
bacterial growth across multiple species, toxicity, and the accuracy of the designed binding mode. The overall
workflow will be implemented as iterative cycles of design-synthesis-test-learn to enable simultaneous
optimization of potency, bacterial growth inhibition, stability, and other drug-like properties. Overall, SPase I
inhibitors developed in this project will be promising candidates for further development as antibiotics. The
computational and experimental methods developed during this project will be broadly applicable to targeting
other bacterial proteins for designing new antibiotic candidates or inhibitors that can address antibiotic
resistance mechanisms."
10889836,"A novel gene-based immunotherapy inducing melanoma destruction
In the U.S., nearly 100,000 new melanoma diagnoses and 8,000 deaths are expected in 2023. Despite the
advent of immunotherapy, especially checkpoint inhibitor antibodies (Abs), advanced melanoma remains a
progressive and incurable disease for most patients. There is an urgent need for new melanoma therapies.
Autologous melanoma vaccines that use endogenous anti-a-Gal antibodies (Abs) (present in all human serum)
as adjuvants to enhance the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) of
melanoma have been explored but were only partially successful. In a different context, anti-a-Gal Abs play a
critical role in the rapid rejection of xenografts, e.g., a pig kidney transplanted into a human recipient. The so
called hyperacute rejection of the xenograft occurs within minutes to hours due to the fact that pig cells express
large amounts of a-Gal, which are foreign to humans, and are recognized by human anti-a-Gal Abs.
Opsonization of the pig cells with the Abs leads to their destruction primarily by complement-dependent
cytotoxicity (CDC), but also Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and Ab-dependent cell-mediated
phagocytosis (ADCP). Similarly, the anti-a-Gal Abs present in Chagas disease patients kill the parasite
Trypanosoma cruzi that causes this disease. T. cruzi expresses large amounts of a-Gal epitopes, one prominent
being Gala1,3Galb1,4GlcNAc (Gala3LN), on its cell surface, and the patient's anti-a-Gal Abs lyse the parasite
within minutes by complement-dependent and independent mechanisms. If cancer cells could be made to
express a-Gal on their cell surface, the patient's own already existing anti-a-Gal Abs could target and destroy
them by CDC, ADCC, and ADCP. The destruction of glycoengineered a-Gal expressing melanoma cells by CDC
in the presence of anti-a-Gal Abs and complement has already been demonstrated in vitro but has never been
explored in vivo. Here we propose a novel melanoma gene therapy in the a1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout
mouse model, in which melanoma cells are selectively transfected in vivo with a gene coding for a1,3-galactosyl
transferase (a1,3GalT). This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of terminal Gala3LN residues on glycoproteins.
Based on recent advances in nanotechnology, we propose to use functionalized lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as
delivery vehicle for the transfection. The LNPs have a DT7 peptide and folate on their surface that target the
receptors TfR1 and FRa overexpressed in melanoma (and other cancers). These receptors can internalize the
LNP by an active transport, thus delivering the gene. The transcription is under the control of a melanocyte-
specific promoter, which adds another level of selectivity for targeting melanoma. Not all melanoma cells need
to be transfected, as the adaptive immune system would also be activated resulting in specific anti-tumor
immunity. This novel a-Gal based gene therapy could result in the rapid destruction of melanoma cells and anti-
tumor immunity in vivo."
10891568,"Anthracycline chemotherapeutics, such as doxorubicin (Doxo), are among the most effective and widely used
antineoplastic drugs, yet their clinical application is limited by the damaging cardiac side effects that occur in
many patients. Anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC) can manifest acutely during cancer treatment, but can
also cause life threatening cardiomyopathy and heart failure that develops years after the cessation of
chemotherapy. Despite significant effort, the underlying mechanisms responsible for AIC are not fully defined,
and it remains impossible to predict which patients will experience cardiotoxicity. Thus, there is an urgent need
to advance mechanistic understanding in order to discover novel treatments and/or predictive biomarkers for this
devastating condition. The overall objective of this proposal is to comprehensively define how type I interferon
(IFNab) signaling, a pleiotropic innate immune pathway, potentiates the cardiotoxic effects of Doxo
chemotherapy. The central hypothesis is that Doxo-induced cardiac DNA damage triggers the Stimulator of
Interferon Genes (STING)-dependent production of IFNab, in turn driving a self-propagating cycle of
mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and cardiomyocyte death that contributes
to cardiac remodeling and failure. In support of this hypothesis, ongoing studies have revealed that Doxo robustly
engages STING to upregulate IFNab responses in cardiac cells and tissue. Strikingly, both male and female
mice lacking STING or IFNab signaling are protected from Doxo-induced cardiac mitochondrial damage,
myocardial remodeling, and left ventricle dysfunction. Conversely, treating melanoma-bearing mice with adjuvant
IFNa in addition to Doxo results in enhanced cardiac fibrosis and contractility defects relative to tumor-bearing
mice receiving Doxo alone. To gain additional insight into what appears to be an unappreciated yet fundamental
driver of AIC, three related, but independent, aims are proposed. Aim 1 will employ single-cell approaches, a
novel IFNab reporter mouse, and conditional knockout lines to define the kinetics of IFNab production in the
heart and determine that STING-IFNab signaling in cardiac myeloid and myocyte populations contributes to AIC.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that STING-IFNab signaling amplifies the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines by
potentiating mitochondrial dysfunction, iron overload, and oxidative stress. Finally, Aim 3 will establish that the
IFNab-mediated upregulation of Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1) enhances sensing of cardiac DNA damage and
promotes cardiac necroptosis to sustain inflammatory responses during and after Doxo chemotherapy. This
proposal is innovative because it expands the current paradigms of AIC and defines the IFNab-mitochondrial
nexus as a fundamental pathway contributing to myocardial damage. In addition, this research will contribute
significant new information on how cardiac innate immune responses potentiate heart failure. In the long term,
this work may positively impact human health by establishing IFNab as a predictive biomarker for cardiotoxicity
and/or revealing novel therapeutic approaches to combat cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction."
10891735,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The detailed structure of the beta cell niche, and that of the islet in general, remains poorly understood;
this is particularly the case for human islets. Islet structure appears heterogeneous across the pancreas, and
whether conserved structural features exist among islets is unknown. A detailed understanding of the
organizational principles of islets would advance our ability both to reconstitute stem-cell derived islets as a
cure for type 1 diabetes (T1D) and to block the progression of events that lead to the loss of beta cells during
the progression of diabetes. Therefore, the goal of this proposal is twofold: first, to identify and experimentally
validate the critical organizational principles of the islet in general and the beta cell niche in particular, and
second, to leverage these organizational principles to engineer more functional islets as a cure for T1D.
 Towards the first goal, we have developed a custom, semi-automated, 3D imaging and analysis
pipeline that permits quantification of the statistical properties of the beta cell niche at sub-micron resolution
and across hundreds of individual beta cells. Preliminary analyses of healthy mouse and human islets revealed
that (1) in both species beta and delta cells maintain at least one physical contact with a source of basement
membrane, whereas alpha cells do not, and (2) beta cells in engineered islets that contact sources of vascular
basement membrane have dramatically elevated insulin expression. We hypothesize that beta cell contact with
basement membrane is a conserved element of islet structure that must be incorporated into engineered islets
to optimize beta cell function. Towards the second goal, we have demonstrated that reconstituting stem cell-
derived beta cells into pseudo-islets in a manner that maximizes their contact with basement membrane
improves their response to glucose by at least two-fold in vitro and further extends their functionality in vivo.
 Building on these preliminary findings, we first aim to dramatically expand this analysis across tens of
thousands of individual cells in human and mouse islets, incorporating all endocrine cell types along with
immune cells, vascular cells, and nerves. This will result in the first quantitative assessment of the endocrine
cell structural niche that acknowledges the structural heterogeneity of islets and aims to identify conserved
structural motifs. Second, we aim to determine if conserved features of the beta cell niche are necessary and
sufficient for optimal beta cell function. We will test this hypothesis using in vitro reconstituted islets, primary
human islets cultured ex vivo, and engineered human islets transplanted into mice in vivo. Finally, we will use
genome editing techniques to test the necessity of specific pericyte-derived basement membrane molecules
for glucose homeostatic function in engineered islets. Taken together, our study will provide the first
quantitative structural blueprint for the pancreatic islet, will identify features of the beta cell niche that are
conserved and divergent across humans and mice, and will demonstrate a strategy for reconstituting more
functional human tissues from stem cells that uses a structural blueprint to guide tissue engineering."

10891546,"SUMMARY The four lead investigators of this project have assembled ~10,000 patients with focal and
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). With this largest
ever FSGS/NS cohort assembled, the vast majority whom have already undergone genome-wide sequencing,
we propose a collaborative effort to understand the genetic basis of this disease. The increasing number of
identified genes that can cause FSGS/SRNS when altered shows that these phenotypes are genetically highly
complex. Understanding the genetic basis of FSGS and NS is important: (1) Work to date has been the major
driver in understanding the molecular structure of the glomerulus; (2) Genetic diagnosis affects therapy: some
mutations predict lack of response to steroid therapies, others predict response to nutritional supplementation;
(3) Genetics affects renal transplant planning and outcome. Major gaps remain: (1) Most FSGS/NS cases still
are genetically unresolved; (2) The basis of disease is complex and involves the contribution of different
variants across the spectrum of allelic frequency and penetrance; (3) Our ability to declare genetic causality at
the single-patient level is limited; (4) Therapeutic options are limited. Thus, we will use this large cohort and
new analytic methods to address these gaps. We will functionally characterize many of the new alleles and
new FSGS genes that we discover. We will develop and distribute reagents, including patient-derived iPS cells.
We will create a database by aggregating exome and genome sequencing data from our patients, and make
this data available via web browser to assist the research community. We plan to: Aim 1: Understand the
spectrum of rare genetic variation that causes (or increases risk of) FSGS and NS in humans. By leveraging
large sample sizes, we can use approaches that are not otherwise powerful enough for disease gene
identification. We will discover novel genes associated with FSGS/NS to identify highly penetrant variants
(including burden tests of rare sequence changes and copy-number variants), define the spectrum of SNV and
structural variants in known FSGS/NS genes, and identify glomerular genes co-expressed with disease-related
genes. Aim 2: Define functional effects of disease-associated variants. We will test effects of
variants/mutations in cell-based assays, develop new zebrafish models by mutating FSGS/NS genes, and
generate a panel of iPS cells from patients with FSGS/NS-associated mutations. Aim 3: We will bring together
all of our genotyping data, generated from SNP arrays, WES, and WGS, to build and maintain a publicly
available variant browser, the “Nephrotic Syndrome Genomic Portal” (NSGP). NSGP will include allele
frequency data, functional classification, and clinical correlates for FSGS/NS. We will summarize, at a site-

10891598,"Sepsis causes an estimated one in five deaths globally, including approximately 190,000 deaths per year in the
United States. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the condition, a “one-size-fits-all” approach to sepsis
care, which is largely the approach taken by clinical guidelines, is unlikely to be most effective. Yet, it is not
feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) among each patient subgroup that can be formed from
the hundreds of possible combinations of important sociodemographic (e.g., age group) and clinical (e.g.,
comorbidities or cause of sepsis) characteristics of patients. Observational studies in electronic health record
(EHR) data could circumvent this feasibility constraint thanks to the large size and “real-life” representativeness
of EHR data. However, such observational studies have the critical disadvantage that they are thought to
merely yield associations rather than causal effect estimates, because they make the untestable and frequently
implausible assumption that all confounders were perfectly measured and adjusted for in the analysis. The
objective of this New Innovator Award is to develop and test a new study design for clinical research on sepsis
– machine-learning-facilitated regression discontinuity (ML-facilitated RD) – that would allow researchers to
determine causal effects for common sepsis care interventions in large-scale EHR data without needing to rely
on confounder adjustment. ML-facilitated RD combines machine learning with a novel causal inference
technique (regression discontinuity) to improve the robustness of the technique for causal effect estimation, its
ability to reliably determine causal effects for each of a large number of highly granular patient subgroups, and
to ascertain the optimal threshold in continuous variables (e.g., in mean arterial pressure) at which the
intervention of interest should be initiated in each patient subgroup. We will additionally develop RD such that it
can be applied to the multi-factorial decisions that are common in clinical care for sepsis. This project has two
steps. In the first step, we will develop these methodological innovations with the aid of extensive simulation
exercises. In the second step, we will test the feasibility and validity of ML-facilitated RD for each of 12
common clinical interventions for sepsis in each of 15 EHR datasets from a variety of clinical settings. The key
innovation of this project is that it aims to establish a study design for EHR data on sepsis that uses a
fundamentally different approach for causal effect estimation than current state-of-the-art methods. By
providing a new tool to clinical researchers for determining the causal effects of clinical interventions for sepsis
in routine care and among highly granular patient subgroups (including which threshold in continuous clinical
measurements is optimal for initiating these interventions in each subgroup), this research would constitute a
major step forwards in individualizing care for sepsis. It would also establish an important foundation for further
methodological innovation and adaptation to allow ML-facilitated RD in EHR data and similar causal inference
approaches to be used in other areas of clinical medicine."
10891599,"SUMMARY STATEMENT
We have identified a previously overlooked problem regarding a possible drug-drug interaction (DDI) among
patients with opioid use disorders (OUDs) with high risk to HIV that are using Pre-Existing Prophylaxis (PrEP).
Morphine and cabotegravir are metabolized by the enzyme, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)
and when combined, can influence the rate of drug metabolism, creating a potential risk for toxicity in people
with comorbid HIV and OUD. Opioids are the cornerstone of pain management, and as long as they are
continuing to be widely prescribed for chronic pain and/ or illicitly abused, the opioid epidemic in the United
States (US) will continue to soar. OUDs are often comorbid with HIV infection, and studies have shown that
individuals who misuse opioid analgesics, as well as other illicit drugs, are most likely to have difficulty adhering
to antiretroviral (ART) medication regimens. Adverse DDI between ART and opioid abuse and/or medications to
treat OUDs are frequently reported. In a recent publication, we showed that co-exposure with morphine and ART
in HIV-infected brain reservoirs led to failure in the attenuation of viral load and increased secretion of viral-
induced inflammatory molecules. Co-exposure with morphine and ART caused an increase in several histone-
modifying enzymes which correlated with an increase in the mRNA expression of different variants of the μ-
opioid receptor; suggesting that changes in epigenetic and opioid receptors may be involved in the regulation of
DDI. Gap in Knowledge: Not much is known about the potential DDI among cabotegravir and morphine and/or
medications to treat opioid use disorders (naltrexone). On that note, we hypothesize that when taken in
combination, cabotegravir and morphine and/or naltrexone exhibit synergism that can influence the
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses, resulting in drug toxicity. We further posit that
epigenetic variations due to the combined exposure of cabotegravir and opioids control the PK/PD responses
by regulating drug-metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and/or the μ-opioid receptors. The goal of this new
application is to evaluate potential interactions among opioids and cabotegravir. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate
the PK responses among the three groups of drugs (cabotegravir - morphine - naltrexone) in healthy mice model.
Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the PD responses, and toxicological interactions among the three groups of drugs
in non-infected or HIV-infected humanized mouse model. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the PK/PD, and
toxicological interactions among the three groups of drugs in non-human primates. Impact: Findings will provide
novel insights in the potential mechanisms involved in the adverse DDIs among cabotegravir and opioids which
are used in clinical settings. Furthermore, an understanding of the pharmacoepigenetics will identify new targets
that might help in the interference with pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of opioids and cabotegravir."
10891605,"Project Summary
 The intestine serves both as a conduit for the uptake of food-derived nutrients and as a barrier that prevents
host invasion by microorganisms. This barrier function is important to maintain intestinal integrity and it is
promoted by immune cells, which can quickly respond to microbial presence in intestinal lumen coordinating
protective functions. Alterations in timing of food intake and diet composition have been associated with the
development of immune-mediated intestinal dysfunctions (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome). However, despite its
profound biological and clinical relevance, there is a major gap in our understanding of how intestinal immune
responses are modulated by food presence in the intestinal tract. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
determine how, during feeding, dietary-derived signals are sensed in the intestine and promote alterations in
intestinal immune responses. Recently, we uncovered a neuroimmune circuit that coordinates intestinal immune-
mediated barrier functions in response to food consumption. This neuroimmune circuit is formed by the
interaction of vasoactive intestinal peptide-producing enteric neurons (VIPens) and type 3 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC3s). VIPens are activated by the presence of food in the intestinal tract, they directly inhibit ILC3 functions.
Although VIPen-mediated inhibition of ILC3 during feeding reduces intestinal barrier functions, it also increases
efficiency of fat absorption from the diet (immune-nutritional trade-off). Importantly, in experimental mouse
models, perturbations in this neuroimmune circuit alters host resistance to enteropathogens and host-microbiota
interactions. We propose to study the mechanism of activation of VIPens by dietary signals as an entry point to
understand how feeding promotes alterations in intestinal immunity. A combination of cutting-edge technologies
to measure neuronal activation in vivo (genetically encoded calcium indicators and intravital imaging), manipulate
neuronal activity (chemogenetic tools and AAV-assisted CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic manipulation), dissect
molecular profiles of cellular circuits (monosynaptic viral tracing and single cell genomics), and control ingestion
of specific dietary signals (diet engineering), will allow us to acquire a mechanistic understanding of how food
consumption can affect intestinal immunity through neuroimmune circuits. The Specific Aims of this proposal
are: 1) to determine the nature of food-derived signals that, by triggering activation of VIPens, coordinate
intestinal immune-nutritional trade-offs, and 2) to dissect the cellular and molecular pathways of VIPens
activation by food-derived signals. These studies will provide the molecular underpinnings of how intestinal
immune responses are being modulated by food consumption, as well as provide new insights of the intestinal
mechanisms for sensing food-derived signals and orchestrating immune-nutritional trade-offs. These studies will
also advance the development of dietary-based therapies to boost immune-mediated barrier functions and the
mitigation of intestinal infectious and inflammatory diseases."

Acute effects of radiation exposures are the focus of emergency medical responses and mitigation efforts, but
the major burden of radiation injury lies in delayed effects. These late and usually long-term effects of exposure
on normal healthy tissues include cellular, molecular, and metabolic changes leading to organ dysfunction and
failure; fibrosis; and neoplasia. The Radiation Survivor Cohort (RSC) is a unique and irreplaceable
population of nonhuman primate (NHP) radiation survivors, which serves the nation’s need to identify and
understand the late effects of radiation exposure; provides long-term outcome validation of acute biomarker
measurements; and provides critical data regarding tissue damage and recovery. RSC investigators at Wake
Forest have assessed adverse effects of single-dose whole-body exposures of 1-8.5 Gy in over 140 rhesus
monkeys observed for up to 15 years after irradiation, with 38 controls. The cohort includes juvenile and adult
exposures, males and females, and subsets of animals that did or did not receive mitigating treatments such
as hematopoietic growth factors or antibiotics. Observations have included an annual cycle of clinical
examinations, imaging (ultrasound, CT and MRI), clinical pathology, and ultimately necropsy examinations.
Major diseases identified to date include (1) metabolic disease and type II diabetes mellitus; (2) myocardial
diastolic dysfunction with fibrosis; (3) neurologic disorders with MRI-detected brain lesions; (4) chronic renal
disease with fibrosis; (5) gastrointestinal disease resulting in chronic diarrhea; (6) immune compromise with
impaired response repertoire; (7) neoplasms, primarily including sarcomas, hematopoietic, epithelial, and
neuroendocrine types. Other stereotypical radiation effects are seen, such as cataracts and gonadal atrophy at
higher doses. Multiple disorders in the same animal were common, up to 8 in high-dose animals, with diabetes
being the most common co-morbid condition. The overarching goal for the proposed new funding period is to
identify and study relevant patterns of post-irradiation morbidity and mortality in this unique, controlled, well-
defined NHP population, by collaborating and sharing data with NIH-funded and other federally-funded
investigators. Sharing will include samples (blood, tissue, body fluids, microbiome) and data (clinical, imaging,
pathology, gene sequence, gene expression, immunophenotyping and other data types) with an active
investigator community currently consisting of 62 investigators across 18 institutions, including outreach to new
investigative teams. The specific aims of this program are to (1) identify and share patterns of post-irradiation
morbidity; (2) identify genomic and biomarker characteristics of animals with differing radiation-induced
disorders; (3) assess late effects of prior mitigator treatment; and (4) refine the cohort to balance age, sex,

disorders; (3) assess late effects of prior mitigator treatment; and (4) refine the cohort to balance age, sex,
dose, and mitigator type, in order to maximize the scope of inference of data derived from the cohort."

Adverse obstetrics disorders, including preeclampsia, preterm birth, and fetal growth restriction, are
common worldwide. However, they are difficult to study given multifactorial etiologies and co-occurrence
of disorders. Placental dysfunction has a role in these diseases but the underlying molecular
mechanisms are not well understood. Integrated multiomic analysis can address this gap by identifying
underlying molecular mechanisms associated with individual disorders and combinations of disorders.
The goal of this study is to advance mechanistic understanding of the molecular networks associated
with obstetric disorders, to identify and prioritize new directions for future research for improving
maternal-fetal health. We propose to find patterns at the individual, network, and system levels that shed
light on mechanisms of disease associated with normal placental physiology and placental dysfunction.
The Sadovsky lab has provided de-identified metabolomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic placental data
paired with histopathology reports and clinical data including demographics, routine clinical labs,
maternal comorbidities, and delivery records. These data come from 333 placentas from people with
singleton pregnancies, including uncomplicated term pregnancy, fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia,
fetal growth restriction with a hypertensive disorder, and spontaneous preterm birth. The analyses in this
proposal are complementary to, and distinct from, those in a separate K99. In Aim 1, we will define
placental physiological association networks to determine placental regulation. We have preliminary data
for pairwise associations between analytes and placental histopathological features using generalized
linear models. We will conduct community structure analysis on these associations to identify
subnetworks of placental regulation and evaluate differences in network identity and structure. For each
obstetric disorder, we will also evaluate the contribution of top interconnected community networks to
regulation of placental physiology by evaluating model robustness and multicollinearity. This will provide
domain-agnostic detection of patterns of systems-level placental regulation. In Aim 2, we will determine
molecular network differences among obstetric disorders. We have evaluated pairwise differences
between individual analytes between phenotypes, and we will build on this work by evaluating placental
network differences between different obstetric outcomes in two ways: determining the network structure
differences between phenotypes, and building and evaluating classification models for obstetric
disorders. We will then perform case-study outlier analysis to provide potential molecular insight into
placental dysfunction on the individual level. This will provide molecular network understanding of
placental regulation and how it’s disrupted in obstetric disorders at the population and individual level."

10869423,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This project aims to develop a new optical imaging tool capable of dynamically profiling immune cells in live
tissue at a single-cell resolution. The immune system plays a vital role in defending the body against invaders
and combating diseases. However, uncontrolled or dysfunctional immune cell activity can worsen various
diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the immune
system, we require tools that not only quantify different immune cells but also observe their functional state
changes and dynamic interactions with other cells in tissue. Recent advancements in immune profiling using
flow cytometry have provided valuable insights. However, tissue dissociation is necessary, resulting in the loss
of spatial information. This is a significant drawback because the spatial context and heterogeneity of immune
cell interactions are crucial for immune function. To address this issue, emerging techniques such as spatial
transcriptomics and cyclic immunofluorescence imaging have been developed. However, these techniques can
only capture static snapshots of cells and are not applicable to live samples. Additionally, they require complex
sample processing and time-consuming data acquisition, and are often limited to thin tissue sections. Observing
and characterizing the immune response in live tissue or animals at a single-cell resolution remains a major
challenge because of the highly dynamic nature of the immune system and its rapid response to external stimuli,
such as infection or drug treatment.
 To overcome these challenges, this proposal seeks to leverage advances in high-speed Raman imaging and
deep learning to create a virtual staining tool for dynamic immunoprofiling. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS)
microscopy is a label-free imaging technique that can rapidly examine intact live tissue based on the unique
Raman vibrational signatures of molecules. We will employ fast hyperspectral SRS imaging to acquire
comprehensive 5D datasets (spatial 3D + spectral + temporal) of tissue. Through iterative deep-learning training
using immunofluorescent labeling as the ground truth, we will construct a multiplex virtual staining model capable
of classifying multiple types of immune cells and their functional states. Different deep learning models will be
tested and compared to traditional machine learning approaches to evaluate the significance of spatial and
spectral features in distinguishing immune cells. The accuracy of classification will be quantitatively determined.
Validation of our virtual staining technique will involve diverse samples, including isolated immune cells from
mouse spleen, mouse lymph node tissue, and mouse tumor tissues. Successful implementation of multiplex
virtual staining of immune cells will enable dynamic profiling in live tissue or animals. We anticipate wide-ranging
applications of this technology in the study of infections, autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders,
and cancer immunotherapy."

Insufficient research exists on the reproductive health of women with rheumatic disease, leaving young women
without reliable guidance regarding contraception and pregnancy. This knowledge gap has resulted in alarming
statistics: 15% of pregnancies in women with rheumatic disease occur while taking teratogens, increasing the
risk of pregnancy loss to 40% and birth defects to 25%. Moreover, women with SLE experience preterm birth
and preeclampsia rates that are 3-6 times higher than healthy women and have remained stagnant for two
decades. The scarcity of trained researchers and mentors poses a significant obstacle to progress in this field.
To address these challenges, this proposal aims to enhance the scientific rigor of research and expand the
workforce of clinician-scientists in reproductive rheumatology through mentoring and hands-on research. Dr.
Clowse, a leading reproductive rheumatologist, is exceptionally qualified to bridge these gaps. She has multiple
federally-funded grants, delivers lectures worldwide, publishes extensively, and mentors numerous trainees. Dr.
Clowse will leverage her unique research platforms to provide mentees with practical research experience
through two approaches: 1.) Identifying risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes and 2.) Developing and
testing clinical tools to enhance reproductive rheumatology care. These projects will expose trainees to outcomes
and biomarker analysis, qualitative studies, and implementation science, thereby equipping them with the diverse
skill set necessary for addressing the broad range of clinical questions in this field. Additionally, mentees will
gain firsthand experience in patient-centered research through regular meetings with a patient collaborator
group. They will develop skills in disseminating research findings through manuscripts, oral presentations, and
content creation for widely-used websites. To foster the nascent reproductive rheumatology community and
extend mentoring beyond Duke University, Dr. Clowse will host a new Reproductive Rheumatology National Lab
Meeting as a monthly teleconference with the goal of increasing the rigor of research and facilitate collaboration
within the community. New research in this proposal will target active lupus nephritis during pregnancy, as it
poses a serious threat to the lives and long-term health of mother and child. With new treatments for nephritis,
there is an opportunity to improve outcomes, provided that pregnant women receive optimal treatment. Dr.
Clowse will develop a patient-centered, data-driven decision tool to guide the treatment of active lupus nephritis
during pregnancy with the goal of transforming care in these high-risk pregnancies. Over the next five years, Dr.
Clowse will train clinician-scientists in reproductive rheumatology, publish novel findings, develop decision tools,
and establish a collaborative mentoring program. By expanding her mentoring skills, she will effectively guide
junior investigators towards independence while cultivating a skilled and resilient workforce in reproductive
rheumatology. This next generation of experts will be well-prepared to address critical clinical questions,
ultimately improving the health of women and their children."

This K23 will provide Laura Myers MD, MPH with time and resources to pursue additional training to become
an independent investigator and leader in mitigating environmental harms in diverse patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Dr. Myers is a Harvard-trained, board certified pulmonary/critical care
physician and Assistant Professor-level researcher at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of
Research. COPD exacerbations are associated with worse mortality and quality of life and account for 65% of
COPD-related health care costs ($18B/year). There is an urgent need to identify patients at high-risk of
hospitalization for COPD exacerbations and find effective interventions. Up to 30% of COPD exacerbations are
due to particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5, where ≤2.5µm refers to particle diameter). A growing fraction
(>20%) of PM2.5 comes from wildfires, which is considered more toxic than PM2.5 from other sources. PM2.5
disproportionately enters the homes of people with low socioeconomic status (SES) through poor
sealing/ventilation systems. An expert panel has identified a critical knowledge gap, lack of evidence on
effectiveness of interventions, such as indoor portable air cleaners, in the wildfire setting. In this proposal, Dr.
Myers will complete the following aims: 1) develop and externally validate a prediction model that incorporates
geocoded air pollution and wildfire smoke data to identify patients at highest risk of hospitalization for COPD
exacerbation, 2) identify modifiable barriers to and facilitators of interventions that mitigate exposure to air
pollution from wildfires in COPD patients with low SES, and 3) conduct a 2-arm, randomized controlled pilot of
a multimodal intervention to mitigate exposure to air pollution from wildfires in high-risk COPD patients with low
SES. Dr. Myers proposes 4 training aims to gain: 1) advanced training in prediction modeling methods using
geocoded air pollution variables as predictors, 2) training in qualitative methods, 3) methodologic expertise in
designing and executing a clinical trial, and 4) deeper understanding of the social determinants of health and
health equity. This research is significant because reducing hospitalizations for COPD exacerbations due to air
pollution from wildfire smoke would improve patients’ quality of life, long-term clinical outcomes and healthcare
costs. This research is innovative because a scalable, non-pharmacologic, evidence-informed intervention (air
cleaners) is applied to a new setting (wildfires) as part of a multimodal intervention, using an ideal testbed
(planned burns within a large catchment area). The work will provide preliminary data for an R01 to test a
multimodal intervention in high-risk patients with COPD and low SES during active wildfires. The results of
future work could lead to policy changes, as demonstrating effectiveness of an intervention could make the
equipment more accessible to patients. The proposal builds on Dr. Myers’ clinical background as a
pulmonologist and previous MPH work. It leverages access to unparalleled longitudinal data for >4.5 million
patients, a world-class mentoring team and advanced analytic training at UC San Francisco and Berkeley."

The proposed MARC at Florida International University (FIU) program is designed to address the national
deficit of diversity in the biomedical workforce. While it will certainly teach practical, career enhancing skills, it
will also address these in the context of often overlooked, underlying challenges such as social capital, STEM
identity, and sense of belonging in STEM research, to demonstrate biomedical research as a rewarding
career. FIU is a public, research institution (R1 Carnegie Classification Doctoral University - Highest
Research Activity) located in Miami, Florida. It has an enrollment of 54,000 students (fall 2021), is designated
an Hispanic Serving Institution (85% Hispanic, Black, or other minoritized groups), emphasizes research in its
mission and includes health and diversity as strategic themes. The mission of the MARC U*STAR Program is
to enhance the pool of UR students earning baccalaureate and Ph.D. degrees in biomedical research fields
and to contribute to the diversification of the nation’s scientific workforce. Therefore, our vision is to provide a
structured training program to prepare high achieving underrepresented students for Doctoral Programs in
biomedical research fields. We will achieve this by providing authentic research experiences, academic
enhancements, skill development, and close mentoring and advising. The program provides motivated,
honors undergraduate juniors and seniors from underrepresented groups with tools, skills, and a sense of
belonging, that will allow each to successfully enter, excel in, and complete a biomedical or behavioral
sciences Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. program. This will be accomplished by immersing each MARC trainee in a
supportive and stimulating research lab of an active researcher with a successful undergraduate mentoring
record, who will develop the individual student’s skills, and properly nurture and enhance the trainee’s interest
in science over a two-year period, culminating with an honors thesis. The MARC program will provide a
monthly stipend and partial tuition waiver, eliminating the need for trainees to seek outside employment and
enable them to focus on their research projects and enrichment activities. The program will supplement the
trainees’ FIU academic year research experience with personal advising, weekly program meetings which
emphasize holistic wellness, professional & academic development, technical skills, travel to scientific
meetings, presentation venues, networking opportunities, leadership opportunities, community outreach
events, and facilitiate participation in an extramural summer research program. Six trainees will be selected
each year from targeted departments including Biology, Chemistry, Psychology and Biomedical Engineering.
Each year, the six seniors will serve as peer mentors to the six incoming juniors (12 total slots) - a key
element to building their network, enhancing their mentoring, building their self-identity as a scientist, and
most importantly their sense of belonging in a science community. FIU provides the environment and
opportunity to develop many well-rounded, underrepresented scientists for biomedical research careers."
10864352,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This NIMHD Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award (K01) for Dr. Jackie Ellison, an assistant
professor of health policy and management at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health,
will establish Dr. Ellison as an independent health services and policy researcher with expertise in evaluating
the heterogeneous effects of reproductive health policies in Medicaid.
Research proposed for this K01 award will leverage the timing and geographic variation of emerging
reproductive health policies to estimate their effects on contraceptive method use, births, and adverse perinatal
health outcomes nationally among persons with Medicaid. Using traditional prespecified subgroup analyses
and newer, data-driven methods for causal subgroup identification, Dr. Ellison will also identify the patient
populations that are most impacted by these policies. Socially, economically, and medically marginalized
patients experience greater barriers to exercising reproductive autonomy, and overwhelmingly bear the burden
of adverse perinatal health outcomes. Consequently, there is an urgent need to not only evaluate the public
health effects of emerging reproductive health policies, but to understand the distribution of policy effects
across diverse patient populations, including those with multiple marginalized identities. Findings from this
research will be disseminated to various stakeholders with the goal of informing evidence-based reproductive
health policy at the federal and state-levels, and within state Medicaid programs.
This project draws on Dr. Ellison’s quantitative training, knowledge of reproductive health policy, financing, and
service delivery, and prior research on health inequities. This work will extend Dr. Ellison’s scholarship into the
fields of perinatal health and Medicaid while incorporating new statistical methods for assessing
heterogeneous treatment effects. Therefore, for this K01 award, Dr. Ellison will engage in training and career
development activities that focus on acquiring expertise in working with the modernized Medicaid data,
perinatal health services research, and advanced statistical and machine learning methods for causal
inference and causal subgroup identification. This project places an emphasis on research translation and
dissemination. With mentorship from a multi-disciplinary team of NIH-funded investigators, Dr. Ellison will also
focus on applying training in these areas to health policy research more generally. This training plan
complements the proposed research and will equip Dr. Ellison to transition to independence, leveraging the
methods and expertise developed in the proposed research with the goal of improving reproductive health
outcomes and autonomy by interrogating the distribution of policy effects across populations."
10863012,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pediatric hydrocephalus is a life-threatening condition denoted by excessive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
accumulation in the brain's ventricles. The most common causes of pediatric hydrocephalus are a previous
infection or intraventricular hemorrhage from prematurity, which have been proposed to be driven by
neuroinflammation. Recent in vivo experiments in adult mice have established that inflammation contributes to
the development of hydrocephalus, and preliminary data that I have generated demonstrate that inflammation in
utero also causes hydrocephalus. Human pathological studies and rodent models have highlighted that
intraventricular macrophages are necessary to clear infection and blood but also may cause off-target damage.
The most abundant macrophages in the ventricle are the epiplexus cells on the apical side of the choroid plexus
(ChP), the essential brain barrier that synthesizes and regulates CSF composition. However, the core function
of these macrophages remains elusive. Following innate immune activation, a diverse population of
macrophages accumulates at the ChP, likely with distinct roles to upregulate or downregulate inflammation and
prepare for tissue repair. Recent data from the Lehtinen lab has highlighted that the ChP epithelial cells express
an essential macrophage survival factor, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), during homeostasis
and is upregulated during inflammation. Additionally, differential expression of the M-CSF receptor, CSF-1R, is
detected in macrophage populations at the ChP following innate immune activation. Despite the critical
importance of brain resident macrophages for proper brain development and the deep understanding of
microglia, the core functions of macrophage populations in the ventricle during homeostasis and
neuroinflammation are still poorly understood. Is the ChP a source of M-CSF to maintain epiplexus
macrophage survival required for core ChP function? Does the ChP M-CSF signaling regulate specific
macrophage populations following in utero neuroinflammation? I will address these questions with
innovative approaches to manipulate gene expression at the ChP in vivo and characterize macrophages at the
ChP with single-cell RNA sequencing, histology, and advanced imaging techniques. I will uncover how the ChP
regulates macrophages through M-CSF signaling during homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Ultimately, I
will test whether these populations can be therapeutically targeted with M-CSF gene therapy at the ChP to
prevent inflammation-induced hydrocephalus. The training plan developed around this research proposal takes
full advantage of the expertise in the Lehtinen lab and the unprecedented resources at Boston Children's Hospital
to fulfill my goal of studying the core CSF and ChP biology. Ultimately this fellowship will enable me to establish
the foundation for my future research program as a tenure-track professor in neurological infectious disease and
neuroinflammation."

Immune stimulatory pathways are dysregulated during chronic viral infections, preventing timely T cell
and antibody mediated immunity. Human persistent viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
hepatitis C and B viruses (HCV and HBV) cause tremendous disease burden worldwide but are restricted to
human and nonhuman primates, which in turn poses great limitations for experimental-based research.
Importantly, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in its natural rodent host has been successfully used
as a model system to uncover common principles underlying the regulation of immune responses during
persistent viral infections, often highlighting basic mechanisms that were later extended into humans.
We have found that interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-27 are essential for optimal CD4 T cell differentiation and CD4 T
cell survival, respectively, while they redundantly induce IL-21, a critical factor for CD8 T cell and antibody
responses, late after infection. Consistently, both IL-6 and IL-27 were absolutely required to control chronic
(but not acute) LCMV infection. More recent data indicate that late IL-27 derived from B cells is crucial for viral
control and it is regulated by host microbiota during chronic LCMV infection. The overall goal of the current
proposal is to fully dissect the mechanisms underlying the antiviral effects of B-cell-derived IL-27 as
well as its regulation by host microbiota and related metabolites during persistent infection. To
accomplish this goal, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will investigate the relationship between
B-cell-derived IL-27 and antiviral responses during chronic LCMV infection. We will test the hypothesis
that B cell-derived-IL-27 is both a dependent and a driver of CD4 T cell responses during chronic infection, and
indirectly enhances antibodies and CD8 T cells, promoting viral control late after infection. In Aim 2 we will
identify the microbiome commensals that enhance IL-27 production by B cells and the impact for
antiviral responses and viral control during chronic LCMV infection. We will investigate the possibility that
Segmented Filamentous Bacteria (SFB), a commensal that associates with accelerated viral control, enhances
IL-27 production by B cells in small intestine as well as T cell responses both locally and at distal sites,
overriding the need for IL-6. Finally, in Aim 3 we will identify microbiota-related metabolites that
modulate IL-27 production by B cells and the impact for antiviral responses and viral control during
chronic LCMV infection. We will investigate the metabolites that associate with the microbiota driving IL-27
production by B cells and evaluate their effects on IL-27 expression (in mouse and human B cells) as well as T
cell responses and viral control in LCMV chronically infected mice.
The knowledge gained from this study will not only enhance our understanding of the basic biology of
key immune regulators (i.e. IL-27, microbiome and related metabolites) but may also be valuable for
therapeutically manipulating these factors during infections and perhaps other immune diseases."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other tau-mediated neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by aggregation
and spread of pathological tau protein in the brain. Despite decades of research, effective interventions to these
diseases are still lacking. It is well-evidenced that women typically show greater tau pathology than men on the
AD trajectory; yet the reason for such sex differences is poorly understood. A better understanding of the
mechanisms underlying the greater tau deposition in women can benefit all by informing causal pathways of
disease and therapeutic targets and strategies that are optimal for each sex. Clinical evidence suggests that low
testosterone levels correlate with poorer cognitive function and greater risk for AD. In particular, a recent study in
the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) revealed that women with lower testosterone tend to have
higher levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), particularly among ApoE4 carriers. This
suggest that lower testosterone levels that typically characterize women may predispose them to pathological tau,
and contribute to sex differences observed in AD. To take these correlative findings to the necessary next step,
our overall objectives are to establish the causal relationship between testosterone and tau in females, to explore
the clinical applicability of testosterone therapy, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Given
testosterone’s anti-inflammatory actions and neuroprotective effects on AD-related outcomes, we hypothesize
that pharmacological induction of high testosterone protects against pathological tau accumulation and spread,
diminishes neuroinflammation and ameliorates cognitive deficits associated with tau pathogenesis, particularly
in ApoE4 females. Based on published preclinical studies on testosterone, we further hypothesize that the
protective effects of testosterone are linked to androgen receptor signaling in astrocytes and neurons, leading to
enhanced neuronal survival, synaptic integrity and reduces neuroinflammation. This project is a new direction in
our research program: In collaboration with experts on reproductive biology and gene expression, we will combine
our expertise in tau biology, sex hormones and transcriptomics to determine how testosterone modulates tau
pathogenesis in a sex-specific manner. We will: 1) Determine how increase of testosterone levels affects tau
pathogenesis in female tau transgenic mouse models with human ApoE4/E3 knock-in; 2) Elucidate the molecular
mechanism underlying the protective effects of testosterone in ApoE4 females by single nucleus RNA
sequencing, and determining the involvement of neuronal and astrocytic androgen receptor signaling. This
project aims to close critical gaps in our understanding of mechanisms underlying sex differences in tau
pathophysiology, and provide novel insights into the influence of androgen on molecular mechanisms central to
AD pathogenesis. Results from the proposed research will address NIA strategic goals: understand the
progression of Alzheimer’s (A), and identify potential therapeutic targets for the development of precision
medicine treatments for men and women (D)."

Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is a troublesome side effect reducing overall daily functioning for
many breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. In Dr. Janelsins’ NCI-funded nationwide, prospective
cohort study, 45% of breast cancer patients report clinically significant post-chemotherapy (URCC10055;
N=945); this is one of the largest studies of CRCI to date and the only one we are aware of in community
oncology clinics. CRCI may also persist long-term; however, large studies incorporating pre-chemotherapy
time-points are needed to clearly elucidate long-term trajectories of CRCI. In URCC10055, Dr. Janelsins and
colleagues used two tests that address specific cognitive functions: 1) the Delayed Match to Sample
(DMS) task—a visual working memory test with sensitivity to the prefrontal cortex dysfunction and with
analogous features to the delayed spatial alternation test used in her CRCI mouse model, and 2) the Rapid
Visual Processing Test (RVP)—a sustained attention test with sensitivity to parietal and frontal lobe
dysfunction. With both the DMS and RVP tests, there was a significant decline in breast cancer patients
receiving adjuvant chemotherapy from pre- to 6 months post-chemotherapy compared to age-matched controls
assessed at the same times (N=943). By comparison, the standard neuropsychological tests did not reveal
significant differences at this time-point suggesting they may lack sensitivity for assessing long-term decline.
We also present preliminary data that the inflammatory pathways may be related to lower DMS scores. Based
on our preclinical data, and literature of others, we will also add a new learning test to precisely address
hippocampal function, the Paired Associated Learning (PAL) test. Our aims are to conduct a
comprehensive assessment of long-term CRCI in specific cognitive functions of visual working memory (DMS;
primary aim; Aim 1a), sustained attention (RVP; Aim 1b) and new learning (PAL; Aim 1c) at 7 and 9 years
post-chemotherapy in breast cancer patients compared to controls, assessing specific factors leading to
cognitive decline, and to assess the impact of long-term CRCI with these measures on daily function (Aim 2),
inflammation (Aim 3), and relationship to other cognitive measures (standard neuropsychological, self-report;
Aim 4). In order to address these innovative aims, we will leverage URCC10055 to collect new 7- and 9-year
data on 450 breast cancer patients (survivors) and 300 controls. These time-points coincide with gaps in the
literature in evaluating longitudinal, long-term CRCI and these are the time-points available during the funding
period. In order to evaluate long-term longitudinal CRCI, we will also leverage the existing URCC10055 data
(pre-chemotherapy, post-chemotherapy, and 6 months follow-up). This proposal will fill critical gaps in the field
in our understanding of longitudinal long-term effects of CRCI from prior to chemotherapy, biologic processes
involved, and impact on overall daily functioning. These cognitive measures could provide practical yet CRCI-
specific screening methods in busy oncology clinics and inform future mechanistic and CRCI intervention trials."

Buprenorphine reduces overdose mortality by up to 70%, making it one of the most critical interventions to
combat the opioid overdose crisis. With the increasing prevalence of illicit fentanyl, patients with opioid use
disorder (OUD) attempting to initiate buprenorphine now routinely report experiencing buprenorphine
precipitated opioid withdrawal (BPOW) despite waiting for withdrawal symptoms to first emerge. In response,
clinicians today are increasingly recommending a novel strategy called “micro-dosing” or “low-dose”
buprenorphine induction (LDBI), where a dose significantly lower than SL buprenorphine (SL-BUP) 4mg is
administered before the emergence of any withdrawal symptoms. The requirements for a successful LDBI
appear to be the sufficiently low initial dose, the up-titration of the SL-BUP dose over several days, and
continuation of the full agonist opioid during the induction. However, in the emergency department (ED) or
outpatient settings where individuals with OUD routinely seek care, the slow up-titration over several days and
the continuation of the full agonist are difficult to implement. As such, research is urgently needed for
buprenorphine induction strategies that can be easily and safely implemented in the ED or outpatient settings.
One possible solution is to utilize extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP). The “standard” approach to
initiating XR-BUP is to administer the first injection after 7 days of SL-BUP. However, XR-BUP is increasingly
used in a “rapid” induction protocol, where XR-BUP is given one hour after the successful administration of even
a single dose of SL-BUP. Furthermore, an ongoing NIDA-funded trial is demonstrating that XR-BUP can be
“directly” initiated without first administering SL-BUP at all, where XR-BUP is administered after the emergence
of opioid withdrawal. However, due to the slow rise in the serum buprenorphine levels, XR-BUP may function as
a LDBI strategy on its own, allowing for XR-BUP to be administered before waiting for opioid withdrawal to
emerge, without using any SL-BUP or concurrent full agonists opioids. If successful, this strategy could facilitate
buprenorphine initiation in the ED and outpatient settings. Unfortunately, no prior research has evaluated
whether this novel LDBI strategy using XR-BUP is safe. To fill this need, we propose to conduct a double-blind,
randomized trial in an inpatient setting with individuals with OUD (n=30). Participants will be randomized to
receive XR-BUP 16mg (n=10), 24mg (n=10) or 32mg (n=10) and remain in a controlled inpatient setting for 5
days. The primary aim is to determine the safety of using XR-BUP as a LDBI strategy. The secondary aim is to
conduct pharmacokinetic analyses of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine and metabolites. If successful, this
research could facilitate the development of a safe approach to initiating buprenorphine treatment without the
need to wait for the emergence of opioid withdrawal, require the need for SL-BUP, or continue the full agonist
opioid. Results from this trial will then lay the groundwork for an adequately powered pragmatic randomized
controlled trial utilizing XR-BUP as a LDBI strategy in the ED and outpatient setting."

Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) leads to sudden death in 15,000 to 30,000 men and women
over the age of 65 each year in the US, and this number is growing due to both an increase in the elderly
population and our increasingly poor life-style choices, e.g. sedentary lifestyle and western diet, resulting in
cardiovascular disease. Known risk factors for AAA include advanced age, tobacco use, male gender, and
cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying cause of this condition is still poorly understood. Recent
evidence demonstrated accelerated AAA growth is associated with platelet activation and platelet aggregates
(thrombi) in aneurysmal segments. Studies have shown that platelets are critically important to the formation
and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We speculate this occurs via a platelet-derived network
of monocyte and macrophage activation. To date, little progress has been made to identify any pharmacologic
treatments which may benefit AAA patients leaving surgery as the only treatment option. The broad, long-term
goal of this proposal is to define the mechanisms by which platelets may regulated monocyte/macrophage
interactions at the site of AAA injury and to develop new and innovative tools to harness this knowledge via
reparative tissue regeneration and de novo morphogenesis. Our team will test they hypothesis that platelet –
leukocyte interactions and cross-talk in a regenerative animal model will provide a blueprint for site-specific
regeneration and healing of cardiovascular damaged tissues, specifically AAA. Our overall project combines
unique animal models and transgenic lines and new interdisciplinary collaborations to accomplish our goals.
Ultimately, our discoveries obtained utilizing this highly flexible Exploratory/Developmental Award will support
the stated mission of the NIA to extend the healthy, active years of life, and may lead to revolutionary medical
approaches for dealing with an, as yet, intractable disease state."

This K23 proposal is designed to help Dr. Pederson achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent
investigator with expertise in developing and testing interventions that reduce mental health stigma, increase
engagement in mental health services, and improve mental health outcomes. The candidate and her mentors
have developed a comprehensive training plan: 1) to build her expertise in user-centered design and digital
mental health intervention development, so that she can engage end-users early in the intervention design
process both in this study and in future trials; 2) to expand her training in community-engaged research to
address health disparities and promote engagement in mental health services; and 3) to bolster her skills in the
conduct of clinical trials and quantitative analysis of clinical trial data for a future R01 application centered on
implementing and testing a fully powered anti-stigma contact intervention. The efficacy and precision of anti-
stigma interventions to improve mental health outcomes among underserved Black adults are grossly limited
and represent a critical public health gap. Studies show stigma compounds disabilities related to the primary
symptoms of mental illness, and increases morbidity and premature mortality related to mental illness.
Compared with white adults, Black adults with mental illness have more chronic disease, and more severe
illness at presentation. Meta-analyses have consistently shown that both face-to-face and video-based contact
with individuals with mental illness can reduce stigma. Recent studies that distinguished contact delivery
showed effect size for video-based contact to be comparable to face-to-face contact. Digital mental health also
offers a platform to overcome barriers to early access, implementation, and scalability. Strong preliminary data
identify mental illness stigma and medical mistrust as critical intervention targets that should be addressed in
order to increase mental health service utilization among Black adults. To address these gaps in the literature,
the following specific aims are proposed: 1) a user-centered design approach will be used to develop a self-
administered, video-based mobile app to reduce stigma and medical mistrust among Black adults; 2) a pilot
randomized trial design will be used to assess the feasibility and acceptability, and test the preliminary efficacy,
of a self-administered, video-based mobile app in reducing mental illness stigma among Black adults with
moderate to severe depression or anxiety; and 3) a causal mediation analysis will be used to estimate the

10873134,"Project Abstract
Over the past decade, optogenetics has increasingly become an important technology for spatiotemporal control
of neural activity, cardio functions, muscle cell activity, protein-protein interaction, and disease applications,
through the genetically encoded light-activated proteins. However, there are still two major challenges of this
technology: 1.the delivery of light to into deep body areas such as brain or heart generally requires the optical
fiber implantation which could result in damage of cells and tissue. 2. Gene expression requires viral transduction,
which suffer from a number of limitations such as the host immune response, the stability expressed proteins
over time, the limitations on maximum gene size and the lack of economic scalability for manufacture. To address
the first challenge, we recently developed a technology named ‘sono-optogenetics’ to convert focused ultrasound
(FUS) to light for non-invasive optogenetics. The nanoparticles are injected into the circulating blood so that
neither craniotomy nor intracranial implantation is required for achieving optogenetics. However, these inorganic
nanoparticles are generally difficult to be modified to emit different colors of light for multiplex optogenetic control
and are not biodegradable after accumulating in the animal livers after use, causing long-term safety concerns.
Therefore, the goal of this proposal and the focus of my research lab, is to tackle the remaining challenges for
optogenetics through designing organic nanomaterials, including hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks
nanoparticles, chemical assembly of DNA plasmids and cationic polymer delivery agents. Specifically, we are
planning to 1) design biodegradable nanoparticles to convert ultrasound to light for multi-colored sono-
optogenetics. 2) improve the delivery of plasmid DNAs through nucleopore through covalent chemical assembly
strategies and 3) design advanced cationic polymers for improving endosome escape, cellular uptake and
diffusivity through extracellular space in non-viral gene delivery. The work will also enhance our understanding
the transport and interaction of organic nanoparticles in cells. As a result, I believe that the proposed works is
well suited for the NIH R35 Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award."
10873140,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction,
specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method
framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated
uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes
genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence
methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study
(GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation,
chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control
decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are
genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant
tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions.
Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These
addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid
addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide
significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant
loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections
among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to
large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships
(such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction.
We propose the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.
 Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.
 Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks.
For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human
brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS
(N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses
will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of
neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find
previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number
of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes."
10873266,"Project Summary/Abstract:
CLN1 disease or Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis (INCL or Infantile Batten disease) is one of the
earliest onset and most rapidly progressing forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL or Batten disease).
CLN1 disease is caused by deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT1). This
deficiency has a devastating and rapidly progressing effect upon affected children that starts within the first
year of life, and because there is no effective therapy available CLN1 disease is always fatal. We have
been able to dramatically improve therapeutic outcomes in PPT1-deficient mice by targeting adeno-associated
viral (AAV)-mediated gene therapy to the central nervous system (CNS) regions that are most affected,
including the spinal cord. However, unlike other forms of NCL, such therapeutic effects are limited to the CNS
regions that are transduced. As such, successfully translating gene therapy for CLN1 disease into the clinic will
be a significant challenge in the much larger and more complex brain of a child. To overcome this obstacle, we
shall use a novel CRISPR/Cas9 generated CLN1 R151X sheep model to refine our therapeutic strategy,
assessing the delivery, dosing, safety and efficacy of gene therapy in a larger species that is ideally
suited for translating these advances. We recently published that these CLN1 R151X sheep display
pronounced CLN1 disease-relevant phenotypes. Our preliminary data extend these observations, revealing an
earlier onset of neurologic disease, and widespread histologically and radiologically detectable pathology that
is more pronounced than in PPT1-deficient mice. We have also shown that an intracranial injection of an AAV9
vector expressing PPT1 raises expression of this enzyme in the brain of sheep to supraphysiological levels.
We believe CLN1 R151X sheep not only more accurately model human CLN1 disease, but also provide an
ideal testing ground for optimizing the dosing and delivery of gene therapy in a fashion that is not possible in
mice. We now propose to characterize the progression of these disease phenotypes in CLN1 R151X sheep, in
order to provide detailed landmarks of disease progression using cognitive and neurologic testing, and MRI
imaging, correlating these data with histological findings (Aim 1). We will also define the parameters of vector
dosing and delivery routes to achieve widespread transduction of the sheep brain and spinal cord, and elevate
PPT1 activity to levels predicted to be capable of producing therapeutic benefit (Aim 2). Finally, we shall
determine the therapeutic efficacy, minimum effective dose, safety and clinical response to this optimized
delivery of scAAV9-CCAG-PPT1 to the brain and spinal cord of CLN1 R151X sheep (Aim 3). These data will
allow us to refine our gene therapy approach, and position us for entry into the CREATE-Bio development
program towards clinical translation of the first effective treatment of this devastating disease."
10873267,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The lack of a clear understanding of Disorders of Deglutition (DD) in infants, i.e., impair-
ments in eating, dysfunctional swallowing, and aerodigestive symptoms contributes to the rising prevalence and
consequences of dehydration, malnutrition, high tube-feeding rates, neurodevelopmental deficits, and chronic
hospital visits. These problems are common in the neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) graduates, particularly
among those born prematurely or surviving after perinatal neuropathology. The estimated cost per neuropathol-
ogy survivor varies from 350K to 500K US$, and prematurity contributes to a staggering, underestimated health
care burden of over ~26 billion US$. This proposal addresses this knowledge deficit and sets the stage for early
and safe-feeding intervention protocols in infants with DD by addressing both diagnostic- and rehabilitative-chal-
lenges to alleviate infant eating concerns that are vital to improving aerodigestive health and neurodevelopment,
which is our long-term goal. The central hypothesis is that characteristics of pharyngeal-, upper esophageal
sphincter-, and esophageal-motility reflexes, and their contiguous and cross-systems relationships will differ in
control and study infants. Our rationale is that identifying these sensory-motor biomarkers will clarify the specific
pathophysiological changes contributing to DD in infants with neuropathology, so that inducible self-regulatory
functions and recovery strategies can be developed. To accomplish this, novel, high-fidelity, video-integrated,
high-resolution impedance manometry methods will be employed at the crib-side while monitoring physiological
safety parameters in infants with DD but without neuropathology (control infants) and infants with DD and neu-
ropathology (study infants). Our two specific aims are 1) to identify diagnostic biomarkers related to pharyngo-
esophageal motility and airway safety which distinguish baseline and active swallowing mechanisms in control
vs. study infants, and 2) to test the safety and effectiveness of targeted lingual nutritive stimulation in restoring
pharyngo-esophageal motility and airway safety functions in tube-fed control and study infants during maturation.
Applying robust state-of-the-art technological advances using video-integrated, high-resolution impedance ma-
nometry at the crib-side, new mechanistic insights will be gained by examining the effects of targeted provocation
on full column esophageal motility, and airway-digestive interactions. Completion of the proposed aims will 1) ad-
vance data analysis algorithms and feeding protocols to facilitate transdisciplinary training, bio-feedback, and
parent education; and 2) design a decision-making process to improve personalized nutritive therapies. This
proposal addresses a critical need in neonatal gastroenterology by examining unique mechanisms and defining
the basis for preventative and corrective therapies critical to addressing this challenging public health burden,
which contributes to significant socio-economic burden, prolonged hospital stays, neurodevelopmental delays,
or death. This will be accomplished by improving infant feeding, swallowing, airway, and digestive difficulties and
advancing nutrition, growth, and long-term neurodevelopment, all within NIDDK's mission."
10873269,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescent intimate partner violence (IPV) is a major public health problem in the United States. More than 60%
of adolescents aged 12-18 in relationships report experiencing IPV (physical, sexual, and/or psychological
abuse). Given the widespread prevalence and associated adverse outcomes, states are actively engaged in
primary prevention strategies for reducing IPV, including the enactment and implementation of IPV laws. These
state laws, which are rapidly expanding across the country, have the potential to alter the social context in which
IPV occurs by encouraging or requiring school districts to adopt prevention education curricula and policies for
addressing IPV. Such policies include definitions, training requirements for teachers and staff, and reporting
procedures. Currently, 19 states have passed laws encouraging or mandating school IPV policies. Despite these
laws gaining momentum in the past decade, there is a paucity of research examining the effectiveness of state
laws and how schools implement policies to meet states’ legal mandates. The objectives of the proposed
research in this Pathway to Independence Award are to determine if state IPV laws reduce the prevalence of
adolescent IPV victimization and to assess if and how high schools implement these laws adequately. The
specific aims are to: 1) estimate the effectiveness of state IPV laws on reducing the prevalence of adolescent
IPV; 2) assess the implementation of IPV laws and the relationship between school IPV policies and IPV
outcomes at the school-district level; 3) identify barriers and facilitators to implementing IPV policies in high
schools; and 4) develop, refine, and test the feasibility and acceptability of a toolkit for implementation of IPV
legislation in high schools. This study will provide the largest and most comprehensive evaluation of state IPV
legislation to date. Findings will provide critical data on the effectiveness of school IPV policies in preventing
adolescent IPV and actionable evidence for policy makers and agencies responsible for carrying out IPV policy
implementation. To acquire the necessary skills to accomplish this project, I will receive training in three critical
areas: 1) health policy and advanced econometrics; 2) implementation science; and 3) qualitative methods. I will
also engage in professional development, extend my professional networks, and further develop my grant writing
and oral presentation skills. I have assembled an interdisciplinary mentorship team with expertise in public
health, medicine, public policy, law, and education to ensure completion of the proposed research and training
plan and a successful transition to independence. This Pathway to Independence Award will enable me to
develop into an interdisciplinary, independent investigator who examines the causes and consequences of IPV
at the individual level and assesses how multilevel policies and interventions can prevent adolescent IPV."
10873270,"Project Summary
The goals of this proposal are to develop a novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology
for characterization of sarcopenia, loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, in heart failure (HF) and support
the career development of the investigator, Brendan Eck, PhD, in aging and biomedical imaging research.
Research: Sarcopenia in HF is independently predictive of poor outcomes. Although primary sarcopenia is a
condition of aging, rates of sarcopenia in HF are greater than the general population. Pathophysiological
mechanisms in the heart and skeletal muscle have been identified that link HF and sarcopenia. Current tools
for assessing sarcopenia in HF are indirect or are not sensitive to alterations in skeletal muscle that occur early
in disease. Quantitative MRI can provide tissue property measurements that are potentially sensitive to
pathological changes in skeletal muscle. However, existing techniques are impracticably slow or not
reproducible. MR fingerprinting (MRF) has developed as a rapid, reproducible technique for quantification of
multiple tissue properties. However, quantitative T1rho, a measure sensitive to alterations in protein content,
has only recently been shown to be quantifiable by MRF with no study of its use in sarcopenia. This project
aims to develop T1rho-MRF to simultaneously quantify T1rho and other MRF-derived skeletal muscle
properties. T1rho-MRF will also be developed for cardiac imaging to investigate tissue alterations affecting
both skeletal muscle and myocardium in sarcopenia with HF. In Aim 1 of the project, the T1rho-MRF
technology will be developed and optimized in simulations. T1rho-MRF will be validated in physical phantoms
and in human subjects. Skeletal muscle biopsy will also be acquired and T1rho-MRF will be compared to
tissue properties such as fiber type proportion. In Aim 2, healthy controls and HF patients, with sarcopenia and
without sarcopenia, will be scanned with T1rho-MRF. Quantitative values will be compared between groups to
characterize HF patients with sarcopenia. T1rho-MRF measurements will be correlated with function from grip
strength, 6-minute walk, and cardiopulmonary tests.
Career development: The investigator has a technical background in quantitative cardiovascular imaging and
aims to transition to aging and biomedical imaging research. This research project develops critical skills and
knowledge for the investigator’s career development. The career development plan provides training in biology
of aging, biology of skeletal muscle, engagement with clinicians to understand clinical assessments of
sarcopenia in HF, and imaging research study design and execution. Training includes both didactic and
experiential components. A diverse mentorship team, consultant, and collaborators contribute complementary
skills toward developing the candidate’s interdisciplinary research program.
Summary: The proposal will provide novel imaging tools to assess sarcopenia in HF and support the career
development of the investigator to become an independent researcher in aging and biomedical imaging."
10873298,"Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD) is a common type of arthritis defined by the
presence of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in articular cartilage. It is particularly
common in the US Veteran population as risk factors for CPDD including advanced age and
prior joint trauma are highly prevalent in American Veterans. We recently published a study of
US veterans using ICD-9 codes to identify 29,000 American Veterans with the disease in a
single 5-year period. While CPDD affects elderly patients in a sporadic fashion, it also occurs
prematurely in familial patterns. Studies of familial forms of this disease present exciting
opportunities to identify novel therapeutic targets for this currently untreatable arthritis. We
recently confirmed that a mutation in the stop codon of TNFRSF11B causes early onset CPDD.
TNFRSF11B codes for osteoprotegerin (OPG). The OPG mutation causing CPDD (mtOPG)
results in an additional 19 amino acids added to the protein's C terminus near the heparin
binding domain. OPG is decoy receptor for receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand
(RANKL). RANKL promotes osteoclast formation, and because OPG blocks its function,
reduction of OPG activity results in increased osteoclastogenesis. The phenotype of affected
patients with this mutation includes exuberant CPP crystal formation, mild osteopenia and
severe joint degeneration, a phenotype consistent with a loss of function of OPG. Indeed,
preliminary data demonstrate that recombinant mtOPG displays inefficient inhibition of
membrane-bound RANKL resulting in excess osteoclastogenesis in vitro. Interestingly,
osteoclast conditioned media potently stimulates biomarkers of CPP crystal formation in
chondrocytes. The purpose of this work is to investigate the conceptually innovative
hypothesis that mtOPG produces CPDD by increasing osteoclastogenesis in
subchondral bone. In specific aim 1, using in vitro and in vivo models, we will show that
compared to wild type OPG (wtOPG), mtOPG ineffectively binds to the osteoblast cell
membrane. resulting in excess un-opposed membrane-bound RANKL and increased osteoclast
formation. Overabundant osteoclasts in subchondral bone produce joint damage and release
CPP crystal-promoting factors into articular cartilage. In the second aim, structural studies using
chromatography, surface plasmon resonance and small angle x-ray scattering, will demonstrate
reduced affinity of mtOPG to bind heparan sulfate and decreased dimerization. The scientific
premise of this work stems from careful observations of the phenotype of patients with the OPG
mutation and is supported by preliminary in vitro functional studies of mtOPG. These studies are
the first to identify the OPG/RANKL/RANK pathway in CPDD and to implicate subchondral bone
as a target tissue in this disease. The shared clinical features of patients with CCAL1 and those
with sporadic CPDD as well as the existence of available drugs which target this pathway make
this work particularly exciting."
10870491,"SUMMARY
Regulatory T cells (Treg) are critical in controlling alloreactive T cell responses in organ transplant recipients,
but differences in suppressive capacity exist within phenotypically similar cells. Despite transcriptional
heterogeneity within the Treg compartment, lack of available technical approaches has prevented any
assessment of their functional heterogeneity.
 The Treg suppressive capacity is associated with a distinct metabolic signature defined by increased
oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and decreased glycolysis. Cellular reduction-oxidation (redox)
homeostasis mechanisms are fully intertwined with metabolic state; T cells engage specific metabolic pathways
and also rearrange their redox system, to maintain T cell metabolic rewiring and cell fate. Regulation of de novo
synthesis of the antioxidant glutathione (GSH) is a crucial redox homeostasis mechanism in Treg. These cells
respond to activation-induced oxidative stress by increasing glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL) activity to form
gamma-glutathione cysteine (-GC) and maintain high GC and low GSH intracellular levels (while Teff then
shuttle -GC to increase intracellular GSH). This particular balance of high -GC and low GSH (GSH
homeostasis) needs to be preserved for Treg to exert a suppressive function.
 The current techniques for capturing GSH homeostasis in Treg are inadequate and the only available
assays measure -GC in cell lysates (not in live cells). In addition, most commercial GSH sensors bind irreversibly
to GSH, eliminate it from the cells and thus completely disrupt GSH homeostasis and lose information on
heterogeneity, which we contend is crucial. In this proposal, we will develop an approach to capture the
heterogeneity in GSH homeostasis in Treg using a small-molecule dual -GC/GSH sensor that overcomes these
limitations. We will use it to test the hypothesis that cell-to-cell differences in GSH homeostasis within Tregs
underlies the heterogeneity in Treg suppressive capacity (Aim 1), and to provide proof-of-concept that this
approach can capture clinically relevant heterogeneity in circulating Treg from kidney transplant recipients
treated with anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab) (Aim 2).
 At the end of the R21 we will have generated a small-molecule biosensor to obtain GSH-homeostasis
profiles in Treg, mapped the relationship onto Treg suppressive capacity, and demonstrated the translational
potential of this approach. This is a technically challenging approach (high-risk), but the results have the potential
to provide a tool to identify previously undetected functional differences within the Treg compartment (high-
reward), setting the basis for an R01 testing the mechanisms responsible for this heterogeneity."

Physical inactivity is associated with poor asthma control and lower quality of life. Rates of physical inactivity,
asthma, and asthma mortality among Black girls are higher than their White counterparts. Our formative work
identified barriers to physical activity among Black women with asthma and led to the development of a
culturally tailored physical activity intervention for Black women with asthma (ACTION: A lifestyle physical
activity intervention for minority women with asthma). The goal of this study is to adapt the intervention for
Black girls with asthma using a dyad approach. We will engage urban Black girls (8-12 years) with asthma and
their mothers in interviews to understand how the ACTION intervention should be modified to fit the needs of
urban Black girls with asthma. We will modify and then pilot test the intervention (Mothers and Daughters in
ACTION). This study will provide the first ever evidence of a family-based lifestyle physical activity intervention
culturally tailored for urban Black girls with asthma, a population that is understudied yet plagued by low levels
of physical activity and poor health outcomes. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team that has the
necessary expertise to carry out the proposed study, including in asthma, physical activity, dyad interventions,
program development, qualitative methods, as well as observational and randomized studies. This award will
provide the infrastructure and data about feasibility and preliminary efficacy to apply for funding (NIMHD R01
RFA-MD-22-007) to rigorously test the efficacy of the Mothers and Daughters in ACTION and advance
management of asthma in minority populations living in low-resourced urban environments."
10871017,"Abstract
One of the key complaints of persons who sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) is persistent memory dysfunction.
While a large body of evidence indicates that preventing neuronal loss in the acute stage of TBI can improve
outcome, strategies aimed at improving the function of the surviving neurons are scarce. The hippocampus,
which is essential for learning and memory, is a key region of the brain whose function is often compromised in
experimental models of TBI as well as in human patients. The ensuing learning and memory impairments can
interfere with every day activities and compromise quality of life. These deficits, which can occur in the absence
of neuronal loss, are likely due to perturbations of hippocampal function. As an animal learns new information,
hippocampal neurons fire and change their properties (e.g. undergo plasticity) in order to store the new
information. In periods of awake restfulness and sleep, the hippocampus spontaneously and rapidly “replays”
the learned information in a pattern called a sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R). It is thought that SPW-Rs play a critical
role in reinforcing the learning experience, with disruption of SPW-Rs being demonstrated to cause hippocampal-
dependent memory impairments. Although TBI is known to cause learning and memory impairments, it is not
known if these deficits result, in part, from reduced SPW-Rs, or if memory can be restored by augmenting ripples.
In order to bridge this knowledge gap, we propose to record SPW-R activity in behaving animals using probes
implanted into the dorsal hippocampus of sham and TBI rats. We will then test if optogenetic or pharmacological
stimulation of hippocampal ripples can be used to improve the memory of TBI animals. The research proposed
in this R21 application aims to obtain maximum payoff, and thus has risk that goes along with it."

irradiations with accurate dosimetry. The Core will provide: a) photon irradiations of both mice and blood,
spanning a dose-rate range of 6 orders of magnitude (5 Gy/sec to 0.1 Gy/day), b) exposures of blood and mice
to neutrons with an energy spectrum mimicking that of a nuclear detonation and to mixed neutron+photon
fields, and c) partial body irradiations of mice (hemibody or whole thorax) using photons.
 Central to reliable and reproducible irradiation and dosimetry is an effective quality control system. The
Irradiation & Dosimetry Core has in place a series of Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) covering operation
and dosimetry both for our standard irradiation sources as well as the non-standard CMCR-specific irradiation
sources, such as the VAriable Dose-rate External Cs-137 irradiatoR (VADER) and the Columbia IND-spectrum
Neutron Facility (CINF). The Core will collaborate with the NIAID-wide Radiation Physics Core to ensure that
these SOPs are in accord with the accepted irradiation procedures across NIAID-funded programs.
 While standard dosimetric techniques will be used for most experiments, the Core will use advanced
customized technologies to address the challenges of some of the proposed irradiation modalities. Organ
dosimetry and dose verification will be performed using a unique heterogeneous mouse phantom,
microMOSFET dosimetry, and Gafchromic film. In-vivo dosimetry for long-term experiments in the VADER,
where mice are not restrained, will be performed using encapsulated thermoluminescent detectors, injected
subcutaneously."

Research, University of Texas San Antonio Health, Eastern Virginia Medical School, and VUMC/Meharry
Medical College. The overall Aims of this BCC serve to develop, assess, and optimize MPS-SEQ and MPS-50
for identifying high-grade prostate cancer in diverse at-risk populations. Our BRL will also focus on standardizing
clinically-validated biomarker assays for consistent and reliable use in accordance with CLIA/CAP guidelines at
the U-M Center for Translational Pathology in order to facilitate network consortium studies and at LynxDx in
order to scale, commercialize, and obtain FDA approvals. As recognized by the EDRN, novel biomarkers specific
for aggressive prostate cancer are urgently needed. Importantly, our mission and efforts extend beyond our BCC
and prostate cancer, as we actively participate in the EDRN biomarker community and support continued
collaborative efforts with other BCCs and CVCs to advance the overall EDRN mission."
10891617,"ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The highly integrated nature of the University of Michigan (UM) Kidney, Urology and Hematology Research
Training Network (KUHR) requires a robust and active Administrative Core. The major goals of the Core will be
to coordinate workflow, distribution of resources and operations assessment of the UM-KUHR, achieved
through the following specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To optimize interaction and coordination across the
U2C Cores and the TL1 and promote Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The Administrative Core will oversee
program organization, governance, collaboration and communication, as well set the processes for self-

the Medical Student T35 Short Term Research Training Grant and the Medical Scientist Training Program. In
addition, we offer multiple research training opportunities to residents. Using the vehicles listed we will connect
with undergraduate and medical students at sister institutions including Wayne State, University of Toledo and
Michigan State University. In particular, we can make deep connections with Michigan State University
through the training grant support of a Michigan State Faculty. Finally, the networking core will facilitate
connection with allied disciplines such as Nursing and Engineering to complete a robust network."
10891681,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – Project 1: Optimizing Treatment of GBM by FLASH
We are proposing the creation of a research program entitled, “Increasing the therapeutic index of brain tumor
treatment through innovative FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT),” focused on translating a novel irradiation
modality rapidly into the clinic. The overall hypothesis to be tested is that radiation delivered at ultra-high dose
rates (compared to the much lower dose rates used in current clinical practice) can significantly ameliorate
normal tissue complications while maintaining acceptable if not improved tumor control. To test this hypothesis,
the program will deploy a comprehensive series of preclinical studies that will critically evaluate tumor control,
neurocognitive outcomes and resultant radiation injury to the brain following FLASH-RT and conventional dose
rate irradiation. Collectively, these studies will generate the requisite data sets required for the rapid translation
of the novel FLASH irradiation platform to the clinical setting. Preclinical studies in mice assessing orthotopic
tumor control, cognition, neuronal and vascular structure, immunomodulation, and oxygen-dependent
mechanisms of radiation injury are coupled with a clinical trial in GBM dog patients to inform the oncologists of
the potential benefits of this potentially paradigm shifting approach. The objectives of this program project will
be facilitated by the activities conducted by the Dosimetry/Physics/Modeling core and the Neurobehavioral core.
Project 1 will focus on the assessing the therapeutic index, comprising tumor control and normal brain injury, of
FLASH-RT compared to conventional dose rate irradiation. Orthotopic tumor-bearing mice will be treated with
FLASH and conventional RT under clinically relevant scenarios: single fraction and fractionated, with and without
concurrent chemotherapy, using electron and MV x-ray beams. The experiments will be conducted across our
institutions (CHUV, Stanford, and Indiana University) using our novel FLASH irradiation platforms, supported by
Cores 2 and 3. We will evaluate cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the differential effects of FLASH
by assessing neuronal and tumor structure, and markers of inflammation/immunomodulation.
The success of this innovative program project grant is bolstered by the unparalleled breadth and depth of
our multi-disciplinary investigative team at UC Irvine, Stanford University, SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, CHUV/Lausanne University Hospital, and Indiana University that has pioneered the
development of the initial experimental infrastructure for conducting FLASH-RT research and produced strong
preclinical evidence of increased therapeutic index, comprising expertise in radiation oncology, radiobiology,
medical physics, and preclinical imaging and accelerator science.
In summary, Project 1 will pave the way for near-term clinical translation of FLASH-RT by systematically testing
FLASH and conventional dose-rate irradiation under clinically relevant regimens, and will complement studies in
Projects 2-4 focused on longer-term neurotoxicity, expanding to other species preclinically, and physico-chemical
mechanisms of FLASH-RT."

The current project (Project 2) involves a comprehensive series of cognitive, structural and immunological
studies that will elucidate the long-term (up to 6 months) impact of clinically relevant brain tumor treatments on
cognition under carefully controlled conditions. Animals subjected to single fraction IR, multifraction IR, and
multifraction IR +/- TMZ treatment arms will be behaviorally tested then analyzed for some of the critical
neuronal and vascular changes essential for proper cognitive function. For this project, these proof-of-principal,
long-term neurocognitive studies must be made in tumor free animals in the absence of confounding disease,
and will provide the foundation for elucidating the basis normal tissue sparing afforded by FLASH in the
irradiated brain."
10895401,"Development of Software to Rapidly Assess Placenta Images at Birth
Project Summary
The placenta is a window into the events of pregnancy and the health of the mother and baby, yet only about
20% of placentas in the US are assessed by pathology exams and placental data is often neglected in
pregnancy research. Since both the mother and fetus contribute to and modulate placental development and
function, data from placental examination may inform short- and long-term clinical care of both mother and
child. Placental pathology remains under-used due to the time, cost, expertise, and facilities needed, even in
high-resource settings. Placental assessment can and should be more accessible to pathologists, clinicians,
and researchers, and assessment at birth can more readily aid clinical decisions and relate findings to
patients. Prior work has used photographic images to measure characteristics such as shape and cord coiling
and related these characteristics to placental diagnoses and outcomes of clinical importance. This project
aims to leverage the simplicity and low cost of digital photographs and the computational and decision
power of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to create software for comprehensive placental
assessment from images of gross placentas. The software could address the need for widespread, simple
placenta assessment, particularly when information is needed urgently, pathologists are not highly trained for
placental pathology, or where resources only allow a small fraction of placentas to be reviewed. The
investigative team, with extensive expertise in placental pathology and research, clinical care, medical
informatics/AI, and image understanding, has developed an initial prototype with promising results for
predicting several clinically impactful diagnoses. Our preliminary data demonstrates that extensive data can
be collected from placental photos and that computational techniques allow the connection of abstracted data
to identify placental disease. The goal of this proposal is to develop and validate software to assess
placentas from digital photographs in any delivery setting. An extensive, first-of-its-kind dataset will be
created from three large hospitals including images and expert pathology reports from pregnancies with
abnormal and healthy outcomes (n>50,000). These sites include a range of characteristics across income,
race/ethnicity, health risks, and hospital resources. The resulting software will glean visual characteristics
from the disc, cord, and membranes and accurately identify specific features (e.g., shape) and diagnoses
(e.g., chorioamnionitis). The immediate information could impact clinical care before hospital discharge, and
ease-of-use will allow inclusion in pregnancy research. This software has the ability to strengthen traditional
pathology exams by standardizing and enhancing the data collected, providing better information to
pathologists. With such huge advances in technology, placental assessment at birth can no longer be viewed
as nonessential or too difficult. When fully developed and validated clinically in a range of birth settings, this
software could have the power to impact the care of millions of mothers and children around the world."

10895542,"Project Summary
Replication fork repair is essential for cell survival and stability of genetic material. In humans,
inefficiency of repair is associated with cancer proneness, neurological, immunological,
developmental defects and premature aging. For microbial pathogens, the ability to repair DNA
damage is required for survival of bacterial pathogens and promotes genetic change that can
contribute to antibiotic resistance and persistence of infection.
The long-term goal of our studies is a more complete mechanistic understanding of the repair of
replication forks and how it affects genomic stability. This will be accomplished using the genetic
system of Escherichia coli, whose physiology is well understood. A central interest is how
bacterial cells signal difficulties in replication to facilitate repair and how this is integrated with
other aspects of bacterial growth. By biochemical and genetic analysis, this work will elucidate
how a newly discovered conserved DNA helicase protein, YoaA, interacts with the replisome to
overcome barriers in replication. This study will specifically address the influence of RNA
transcription and DNA protein complexes on replication and genomic instability and what
mechanisms are used to overcome conflicts between replication and transcription machinery.
The regulatory pathway controlled by stringent starvation protein, SspA, will also be explored to
discover how it impacts DNA metabolism.
Because all cells repair DNA in fundamentally similar ways by evolutionarily related pathways,
these studies using microbial model organisms should reveal mechanisms applicable to repair
of DNA in human cells. In addition, because the DNA damage response in microbial pathogens
plays a role in toxin production, antibiotic resistance and persistence of infection, this work could
provide new information important for the treatment of infectious disease."
10895573,"Summary/Abstract
Cognitive, emotional, interpersonal, and physical functioning are profoundly impacted by Alzheimer's disease
(AD) and related dementias. AD poses enormous public health and societal challenges, and the number of
affected individuals is expected to rise if an effective intervention to stop or at least slow AD progression is not
found. Research on the biological and psychosocial mechanisms that lead to dementia is essential to identify
appropriate targets for interventions. The scientific premise of the proposed study is based on robust evidence
for an association between long-standing personality traits and dementia-related outcomes. The mechanisms
through which these traits lead to cognitive changes, however, are not well understood. Furthermore, with the
onset and progression of AD, personality turns from a risk factor to a clinical sign of the disease, but the timing
and trajectory of such changes are not well understood. By integrating multiple theoretical perspectives (five-
factor model, lifespan models of personality and health, pathoplastic approaches to psychopathology, and
cognitive reserve), the proposed research will test three innovative aims. The first aim is to advance a
mechanistic understanding of the association between personality and dementia. We will test neurobiological
(e.g., MRI brain region volumes and white matter integrity), physiological (e.g., cortisol and cardiovascular
burden), behavioral (e.g., physical inactivity and smoking), and psychosocial (e.g., depressive symptoms and
loneliness) factors in the pathway from personality to cognitive decline and dementia. The second aim is to test
whether personality uncouples AD neuropathology from clinical dementia: We expect that, in the presence of
neuropathological changes, a resilient personality profile (low neuroticism, high conscientiousness) will delay the
time to onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The third aim is to identify the timing and trajectory
of personality change during the prodromal phase of AD and related dementias. To address the study aims, we
will leverage data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). This ongoing prospective study include
measures of the five major personality traits, along with in-depth assessments of relevant risk factors and AD
biomarkers, and they involve long-term follow-ups (up to 40 years of serial assessments of personality in the
BLSA). By leveraging rich prospective data, the proposed project will identify the biological and psychosocial
mechanisms that underlie personality-based vulnerability and resilience to dementia and identify inflection points
for personality change in the earliest symptomatic phase of the disease."
10895574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The long-term objective of this proposal is to build an electrochemical atlas of organelles to guide the
rational manipulation of inter-organelle contacts in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. A new mode of
intracellular communication is emerging at the level of organelles, whereby the membranes of two juxtaposed
organelles are physically connected, via protein-protein interactions on their cytoplasmic faces, referred to as
inter-organelle contacts. Ions and small molecules are actively transferred from one organelle to the other across
these contacts, traversing two sealed membranes. Inter-organelle contacts are vital to cell function, tissue
homeostasis and physiology because they regulate processes ranging from lipid metabolism to apoptosis.
However, we still do not know what signals initiate contact formation or what switches on chemical transport
across contacts, nor can we discriminate between functional and dysfunctional contacts. Hence, although we
know of specific mutations in proteins that disrupt contact, leading to diverse neurodegenerative diseases, we
still do not know how to restore these contacts and treat those diseases.
 I posit that the electrochemical states of organelles, alone and in contact, will inform which pathways and
molecules should be targeted to rectify aberrant contacts in disease states. My rationale is that, if we abstract
out the molecular details, inter-organelle contacts resemble neuronal synapses. Even in synapses, ions flow on
cue across two sealed, abutting membranes. Just as ion-transport mechanisms across neuronal membranes
were revealed by Hodgkin and Huxley’s electrochemical model, an analogous model of organelle membranes
will reveal ion flow mechanisms across inter-organelle contacts and which specific flows are impacted in disease.
I propose to build an electrochemical atlas of organelles as a universal reference to study contacts in health and
disease. This atlas will be a compendium of equations comprising electrochemical models of major organelles,
alone and in contact. By enabling us to discriminate normal and aberrant contacts, I envisage the atlas will reveal
common pathways across diseases that can be targeted to restore contacts with impacted ion flows.
 The inability to assay ions or voltage in organelles has prevented the development of electrochemical
models of their membranes. Over the last decade, my lab developed a chemical platform to quantify ions and
voltage in organelles. By integrating electrophysiology to this platform, I propose to now map out the
electrochemical characteristics of organelle membranes in isolation and in contact, and make an electrochemical
atlas of organelles. We will apply the atlas to elucidate how Ca2+ flow across aberrant contacts between the
endoplasmic reticulum and the lysosome can be rectified to restore lysosomal Ca2+ in parkinsonism.
Dysregulated lysosomal Ca2+ is a common factor across many neurodegenerative diseases and the value of the
electrochemical atlas is its pioneering ability to reveal common pathways that can be targeted for treatment in a
disease cross-cutting manner."
10895583,"Glioma is the most common and deadly disease affecting the CNS. Current projections suggest 22,000 new
cases annually, of which 13,000 will be Glioblastoma Multiforme, which is universally fatal. Despite over 60
years of research, there have been no significant improvements to patient outcome. More recently, high
throughput molecular sequencing technology has open the field of genomics and big data, in the hopes of
providing novel insight to the disease and potential therapeutic inroads. However, these efforts have largely
served to refine diagnosis rather than improve patient prognosis. In an effort to translate the wealth of patient
genomics information beyond identifying novel informatics trends, our program seeks to biologically
functionalize genomics information. More specifically, we have developed tools and approaches that overcome
the pragmatic hurdles of traditional methods. We have taken our previously developed in utero electroporation-
glioma model and added barcode targeting next generation sequencing, resulting in a fully in vivo, non-viral
screening system to test at least 50 different genetic factors. In advancing forward, we seek to: 1) further
pursue our previous findings to understand the molecular mechanisms driving the phenomenon we’ve
observed, 2) advance and upgrade our methods to meet the needs of other systems, and 3) apply our
approach to investigate glioma-associated epilepsy, an associated co-morbidity. Our larger initiative in
functional genomics will: 1) provide new tools and methods for screening and testing genetic anomalies found
in glioma, 2) provide molecular insight into the mechanism that differentially promote variant specific
gliomagenesis within an allelic series, 3) begin to demonstrate the unique biology of familial glioma, and 4)
further investigate the mechanisms underlying glioma driven hyperexcitably thereby addressing a much under
investigated quality of life concern. Ultimately, our programs exists to gain greater insight into the molecular
mechanisms that drive gliomagenesis and associated co-morbidities. This will provide understanding towards
novel therapeutic vulnerabilities."
10895586,"Development of treatment resistance is a major impediment to effective cancer therapy. KRASG12C inhibitors
(KRASi) have been recently approved by FDA and represents a promising new targeted therapy for cancer types
with KRAS mutation, one of the most frequent genetic mutations observed in human cancers. However, as is
the case with standard therapy, majority of tumors that initially respond to KRASi quickly develop resistant
disease. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms of KRASi resistance are poorly understood. To tackle this
challenging problem, this application will capitalize on the PI's track record and expertise in the area of KRAS
signaling and biology and propose a comprehensive research program focusing on understanding the
mechanisms of acquired resistance to KRAS targeted therapy. This application will identify new actionable
therapeutic targets and approaches to overcome resistance, thus greatly improving the clinical outcome of
patients with KRAS mutated cancers. To achieve this, the Yao laboratory has developed in vitro and in vivo
model systems that will be employed to investigate hypotheses regarding mechanisms driving the development
of KRASi resistance. The in vitro model system consists of KRAS dependent and independent cell cultures
derived from genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer as well as human cancer cell lines of
pancreatic and colon origin. The in vivo model system consists of patient-derived colon cancer models that
developed resistance to KRASi, as well as genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer driven by
KRASG12C. The major knowledge gaps to be addressed are that: i) what molecular events are activated to enable
bypass of KRAS dependency in tumors treated with KRASi; ii) how these molecular events function to drive
tumor survival and maintenance in response to KRASi; and iii) whether pharmaceutically targeting the resistant
mechanism can achieve durable therapeutic responses in combination with KRASi. These studies will unveil a
previously unknown mechanism by which tumor cells become resistant to KRAS targeted therapy and may
define an innovative therapeutic option for KRASi-resistant patients. The proposed work comprises an essential
step toward our long-term goal of developing effective therapy for patients with KRAS mutated cancer, in align
with the mission of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) RAS initiative (“Kill RAS”)."
10887486,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will develop the Natural Products Magnetic Resonance Database (NP-MRD), the central repository
for all NMR data generated by the natural products community. The core of the NP-MRD will be an open-access,
web-enabled, community-focused, FAIR-compliant database containing NMR spectra and structures for all
known natural products (estimated to be ~350,000 structures). It will contain (i) legacy (curator-backfilled) NMR
data of NPs derived from the literature, existing public databases, and “private” data archives, (ii) new NMR data
submitted by depositors for novel NPs, and (iii) heuristically calculated NMR chemical shifts for all NPs and,
eventually, density functional theory (DFT) calculated chemical shifts all NPs. Data deposition will be both rapid
(<5 minutes) and simple. The NP-MRD will be closely integrated (through data exchange agreements) with
“sister” databases containing MS, biosynthetic gene cluster, and bioactivity data. It will provide rigorous validation
and data checking (QA/QC) to ensure that submitted assignment data is of the highest quality. Validation and
analytical summary reports will be provided following data deposition. The NP-MRD will also offer powerful
database search, filtering, and querying tools to facilitate spectral, structure and taxonomic searches or
selections. In addition to data storage, retrieval, and curation, the NP-MRD will host an extensive suite of software
tools for NP research. These will include tools for spectral dereplication, structure validation, and NMR-based
profiling of complex mixtures. The NP-MRD will also provide tools for spectral and structural visualization and
comparison, as well as chemical-space network visualization and chemo-taxonomic comparisons. Additionally
the NP-MRD will offer tools for NMR spectral prediction and simulation. A core principle of the NP-MRD is that
availability of high-quality, value-added reporting and interactive tools will encourage user engagement and data
deposition. Software produced and hosted by the NP-MRD will be open-source and open-access. To enhance
interoperability, portions of the NP-MRD and associated software will be “dockerized” on cloud computing
resources and, if needed, converted to web-based APIs. The NP-MRD’s deposition tools will be designed to
work with participating journals’ paper-submission software. The NP-MRD team will engage thought leaders,
journal editors, and database managers to develop consensus protocols regarding data deposition, data format
standards, and data exchange—all compliant with community-established policies and standards. Our proposed
work has already gained traction, as shown by many strong letters of support from key stakeholders. The NP-
MRD will offer online and on-site (at conferences) training on use of its software for NP dereplication and
identification. Resources covering tips, tricks, and techniques in NMR spectroscopy and NMR software will be
made available on the NP-MRD website and through web-based “office hours” to help users, depositors, and
the general NP community. NP-MRD’s long-term goal is to advance and enable natural products research by
archiving and adding real value to natural product NMR data."
10887489,"Escalating trends of increasing environmental temperatures place marginalized populations such as agricultural
workers, who have routine occupational exposure to hot, humid environments, at increased risk for acute health
effects of heat exposure, in particular heat-related illness (HRI) and dehydration. HRI and dehydration are
particularly insidious as they can quickly progress from moderate discomfort to confusion and impaired
judgement, thereby diminishing the affected worker’s ability to seek necessary medical attention. Heat exposure
invokes multiple modes of physiologic response. Thus, multi-modal sensors and computational algorithms to
integrate data streams from these sensors are necessary to better understand how heat exposure leads to acute
health effects. We propose to develop a wireless wearable unit containing multiple nanoscale sensors that can
integrate key physiological signals in real-time and with the ability to predict and generate warning about adverse
events also in real-time. This project is organized around three aims: 1) develop a soft, nanomembrane-based,
wearable biopatch for monitoring physiological conditions, including skin temperature, skin hydration, heart rate,
respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, motion, and electrocardiogram, along with a long-range Bluetooth
transmitter; 2) develop a multi-sensor multi-task learning framework for novel computational algorithms using
machine learning to integrate sensor data in real-time, extracting features and accounting for inter- and intra-
modality correlations in order to develop predictive models for biomarkers associated with HRI symptoms,
dehydration, and biomarkers of dehydration; and 3) determine performance of this technology when used by
outdoor workers in field conditions. We will field test successive prototypes throughout years 1 and 2, recruiting
outdoor workers employed in metro Atlanta to wear both a biopatch and other gear that we have used in our
other studies of physiological responses to occupational heat exposure. We will further test the biopatch under
more rugged conditions, recruiting Florida agricultural workers for the same protocol for evaluation in years 3
and 4. This work is significant in that we will be able to determine and integrate the multiple modalities of
physiologic response to heat exposure to recognize adverse effects before HRI symptom onset. Innovation of
the work lies in the integration of nanoengineering and computational algorithms to track, monitor, and predict
worker response to extreme heat conditions. We have assembled a stellar interdisciplinary team of experienced
investigators from Emory University and Georgia Tech with expertise in nanoengineering, computer science,
and field studies of heat physiology in agricultural workers. Findings from this project will lead to a future
intervention study using the biopatch to send data to Android devices held by the worker, a buddy, and/or crew
chief to determine if using this technology can reduce morbidity associated with occupational heat exposure.
Real-world application of the HRI detection and alert system will rely on machine learning algorithms from the
proposed study to generate alerts if the worker is predicted to have an adverse outcome."
10887490,"Project summary.
 Biological regulation depends on protein allostery, in which a perturbation at one site in a protein causes a
functional change at a distal site. Because characterization of allostery challenges the limits of our technical
abilities – requiring simultaneous observation of changes in the structure, dynamics, function and energetics of
a protein ensemble – few allosteric mechanisms are understood in atomistic detail. This knowledge gap limits
our fundamental understanding of how allostery is conserved, evolved, or affected in disease, as well as our
abilities to design new allosteric proteins. Bridging the gap requires methods to map, validate and tune specific
interactions that drive proteins to shift their equilibria to occupy different functional states.

is the first example of the de novo design of a small molecule binding site in a protein-protein interface to build
a functional, modular sensor/actuator system. In this proposal, I aim to establish a new platform for
characterizing and engineering signal transduction in allosteric proteins. With the guidance of my co-mentor Dr.
Susan Marqusee, a pioneer in hydrogen exchange methods, I propose in Aim 1 to map allosteric and energetic
coupling among protein residues, ligands and solvent in the lac repressor (LacI) using hydrogen-deuterium
exchange with mass spectrometry (HX/MS) and isothermal titration calorimetry. With the mentorship of Dr.
Kortemme, I will computationally test this mechanism by reengineering LacI to switch its allosteric response to
different ligands, establishing a strategy to control conformational equilibria in proteins. In Aim 2, I propose to
extend this approach to proteins in the LacI/GalR family of sugar-responsive transcription factors to determine
and validate to what extent allostery is conserved among structurally and functionally related proteins. In Aim
3, I will apply our platform to characterize the evolution and regulation of allostery in an ancient, highly
conserved protein, and learn how cancer-associated mutations impact its mechanism. With the support of my
mentors, collaborators, and the greater research environment at UCSF and UC Berkeley, I will train in HX/MS,
computational methods development, quantitative analysis of large datasets, library construction, and high-
throughput screening. These skills will help me bridge my background in biochemical engineering with my
fascination with protein regulation to build a successful independent research program investigating the
fundamentals principles that govern allostery, and engineering new therapeutic proteins."
10887491,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alagille syndrome (ALGS) is a genetic, multisystem developmental disorder affecting the liver biliary system,
cardiovascular system, kidney and other organs. The most common phenotype observed in ALGS patients is a
severe decrease in the number of bile ducts in the liver (called bile duct paucity). Similar to other diseases
involving intrahepatic biliary system, bile duct paucity and its consequences often lead to cholestatic
phenotypes (like severe itching) and end-stage liver disease in ALGS patients. Dominant mutations in a gene
called JAG1, which encodes a ligand in the Notch signaling pathway, were identified as the cause of ALGS in
1997, and were later shown to be responsible for about 95% of ALGS cases. However, despite the wealth of
knowledge on the function and regulation of Notch pathway and despite the passage of more than 2 decades
from the discovery of JAG1 in ALGS patients, there is still no mechanism-based therapy for this disease. The
only cure for ALGS liver disease and diseases of bile duct paucity is liver transplantation. However, the
shortage in liver donor poses a significant challenge to this patient population. Moreover, involvement of other
organ systems—including the cardiovascular and renal systems—in many ALGS patients makes them poor
candidates for liver transplantation. Moreover, for those who do receive a liver transplant, a higher frequency of
cardiovascular and kidney complications are observed, and the long-term effects of immunosuppressive
therapy can be problematic. Therefore, development of therapies that can correct or decrease the degree of
bile duct paucity and help avoid or delay transplant is a major unmet clinical/medical need of patients with
ALGS and other diseases with bile duct paucity. Building on our recently published and preliminary data, the
current application proposes preclinical studies to directly address this need. We have established a mouse
model for ALGS by removing one copy of Jag1 on a C57BL/6 genetic background. This model allowed us to
identify two dosage-sensitive genetic modifiers of the Jag1 heterozygosity in the liver, which can rescue the
bile duct paucity and liver phenotypes without causing side effects. Moreover, our preliminary data generated
in collaboration with an industry partner indicate that postnatal reduction in the expression of one of these
modifiers by a novel approach can significantly improve the liver phenotypes in our ALGS mouse model. In the
two Aims of this proposal, we will determine the optimal dosage, long-term benefits, and the potential side
effects of our treatment strategy in Jag1 heterozygous and other genetic models of ALGS with more severe
liver involvement and/or multiple organ involvement. If successful, our research will establish a strategy for
augmentation of the biliary tree in bile duct paucity models and will pave the way for clinical studies which
might one day help ALGS patients avoid liver transplantation."
10885496,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. While
significant efforts have been made to develop treatments targeting specific neuropathological conditions, a considerable
number of individuals maintain normal cognitive function despite the presence of these AD-related neuropathological
conditions. This suggests the existence of ""cognitive resilience” factors that maintain cognitive function independently.
Meanwhile, perturbation screen techniques (such as CROP-seq and Perturb-seq) have enabled us to validate the
molecular function via high-throughput perturbation profiling. More importantly, such resources provide opportunities
for in silico modeling the synergistic effects from unseen combinations, which will exponentially increase the space of
perturbation effects. However, these high dimensionalities of single-cell features require advanced computational
approaches to efficiently extract biologically meaningful information. Additionally, batch effects and technical variability
can introduce confounding factors during data integration. Conventional statistical models and machine learning
methods fall short in handling this complexity, while current deep learning models often lack biological interpretability.
To bridge these gaps, our proposal aims to uncover these cognitive resilience factors by developing an interpretable
generative transcriptional program (iGTP) to investigate the genes and pathways associated with cognitive resilience and
identify potential highly correlated synergistic perturbations, which offers a new approach to developing therapies for
prevention and early
clinical
intervention
of AD.
We propose two specific aims to fulfill these goals. Aim 1: To engineer a deep learning framework that constructs
embedding layers with biologically interpretable TPs to model cognitive resilience factors. First, we will leverage
multimodal (genetics, transcriptome, clinical) data to identify those `high resilient' individuals and explore the molecular
signatures of resilience groups. Then, we construct our interpretable generative transcriptional program (iGTP) model to
correct the batch effect and project the cells to latent space (Z) composed of pre-defined TPs, where their biological
relevance will be depicted by their weights in each TP dimension. Aim 2: To Model gene perturbation in the unified TP
space and predict synergistic effects which may enhance cognitive resilience. First, we will utilize cutting-edge
bioinformatics analytical pipeline to quantify the perturbation profiling with single- and multiple- sgRNA perturbations.
Next, our iGTP framework will harmonize the perturbated cells to the same unified embedding space (Z). Our iGTP
model will predict synergistic effects using single perturbations and validate their effects with corresponding - sgRNA
perturbations. Lastly, we will predict perturbation combinations that potentially enhance the resilience factors.
The successful completion of our project will provide 1) an interpretable model, facilitating the exploration of AD
resilience on biologically meaningful dimensions and supporting in silico assessment of the counterfactual prediction
between desired cellular status shift (such as cognitive resilience) and synergistic effects of multiple perturbations. 2)
immediate implications for AD research communities and has the potential to be generalized to other diseases."

The innate immune system can be pharmacologically programed to elicit desired immunological outcomes.
Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is a pattern recognition receptor that has emerged as a promising innate
immune target for immunopotentiation. RIG-I is activated upon recognizing 5’-triphosphorylated, double-
stranded RNA (3pRNA) in the cytosol, which stimulates an antiviral-like inflammatory program that can be
harnessed to treat or prevent a diversity of diseases.
However, the potency and efficacy of 3pRNA has been
limited by major drug delivery barriers, including nuclease degradation, inefficient cellular uptake and cytosolic
delivery, and rapid clearance. To address these challenges, we have developed RIG-I activating nanoparticles
(RANs). RANs are polymer nanoparticles that are engineered to promote the cytosolic delivery of synthetic,
molecularly-defined, and high-affinity stem-loop RNA (SLR) RIG-I agonists recently developed by our team.
The objective of this R01 application is to optimize and advance RANs as a versatile platform for
pharmacological activation of RIG-I. We will accomplish this through the following Specific Aims. First, we will
engineer next-generation RANs with improved properties for systemic administration through optimization of
SLR and polymer charge and hydrophobicity. This approach will leverage combinatorial chemical diversity to
access a new design space for 3pRNA delivery, which we expect will yield next-generation RANs with higher
SLR loading efficiency, reduced cytotoxicity, protection from nuclease degradation, improved stability, and
enhanced immunostimulatory activity. Second, we will establish relationships between RAN properties, innate
immune activation, pharmacokinetics, polymer and SLR biodistribution, and toxicity. These studies are
essential in the preclinical development of new immunotherapeutic modalities and will also yield new insight
into how nanocarriers can be engineered for safe and effective activation of RIG-I. We expect these studies to
yield next-generation RANs that are optimized for systemic administration of SLR therapeutics. Third, while
RANs have broad potential clinical applications, we will evaluate their efficacy as a systemically administered
cancer immunotherapy in poorly immunogenic mouse models of melanoma as a clinically important test case.
We expect to demonstrate that systemic administration of lead-candidate RANs will activate RIG-I in the tumor
microenvironment, resulting in an immunological reprograming of tumor sites that inhibits tumor growth and
synergizes with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Collectively, these studies will position RANs as an enabling
platform for immunopotentiation with potential to address the significant need for new cancer immunotherapies,
antiviral agents, and vaccine adjuvants."
10897101,"Abstract
Despite its success at suppressing viral loads, antiretroviral therapy (ART) cannot eradicate HIV infection. The
main obstacle to curing HIV infection is the ability of the virus to persist under suppressive ART in reservoirs of
latently infected cells, which are established early after infection and supports rebound to pre-treatment levels
if ART is interrupted. Despite the extraordinary challenge of persistent virus reservoirs, a few cases have
recently proved that prolonged viral remission after analytical therapy interruption (ATI) is possible.
Unfortunately, the specific mechanisms regulating HIV rebound remain very poorly understood, thus critically
limiting the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at eradication or remission of HIV infection. In
this project, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators to address directly in vivo how the
size and relative distribution of the reservoir in CD4 T cells and macrophages govern (i) the anatomic
location of persistent viral reservoirs; (ii) the exent of residual inflammation and neuropathogenesis;
and (iii) the time and extent of viral rebound after ATI. Specifically, we propose to alter directly in vivo and
in a highly relevant model for HIV infection (i.e., the SIV infection of rhesus macaques; RMs) the overall size of
virus reservoirs and its distribution between CD4 T cells and macrophages. These goals will be achieved (i) by
using the well-established model of ART-treated, SIV-infected RMs; (ii) by using a SIV swarm that allows
tracking of multiple viral variants; and (iii) by performing in vivo Ab-mediated CD4 T cell depletion before SIV
infection and after SIV-infection during suppressive ART. We will determine how the planned in vivo depleting
interventions alter the distribution of viral reservoirs between CD4 T cells and macrophages; impact the
kinetics and extent of viral rebound following ATI; and influence the cellular nature and genetic fingerprinting of
the rebounding virus. Finally, we will investigate the mechanisms favoring SIV infection and persistence in
macrophages when CD4 T cells are depleted.
We believe that the complementary, comprehensive, highly synergistic, and rigourosly controlled studies that
we propose will provide unprecedented, novel insights into (i) understanding how the cellular nature of the viral
reservoir regulate residual inflammation and viral persistence on ART and viral rebound after ATI, and (2) the
direct role of macrophages in harboring replication competent virus during long-term ART and contributing to
viral rebound after ATI. Critical for our aims, the SIV/RM model allows for investigating the CD4 T cells versus
macrophages contribution to viral reservoir not only in blood, but also in a large number of tissues collected
longitudinally and at necropsy, including CSF and brain tissues. These achievements will inform efforts to
design novel therapeutic strategies aimed at achieving prolonged viral remission of HIV infection."
10897283,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Learning, cognition, and memory require dynamic remodeling of hippocampal synapses, which in turn requires
Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). CaMKII mediates two opposing modes of synaptic plasticity, long
term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), that are induced by distinct Ca2+ stimuli. Both low and high Ca2+
induce CaMKII autophosphorylation (p) at T286, that is required for both LTP and LTD. Additionally, LTP requires
CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor subunit, GluN2B, during high [Ca2+] while LTD requires CaMKII
autophosphorylation at T305/306 during low [Ca2+]. Further, these three mechanisms can undergo complex
cross-regulation which requires the CaMKII 12-meric holoenzyme. Interestingly, pT286 positively regulates both
GluN2B binding and pT305/306 while GluN2B binding and pT305/306 are mutually exclusive. It is unknown how
these reactions and interactions are spatiotemporally encoded within holoenzymes and thus how LTP versus
LTD signal computation is accomplished by CaMKII. For example, it has been shown that pT286 must occur
between two neighboring kinase domains in the holoenzyme. It is still unclear what determines a functional
kinase domain neighbor. Moreover, in vitro binding studies have shown that CaMKII holoenzymes are required
for binding to GluN2B, suggesting that this interaction may require multiple subunits. Still, it is unknown what is
the required stoichiometry and subunit geometry required for CaMKII-GluN2B binding. Initial results suggest that
the holoenzyme rules for pT286 and GluN2B binding are fundamentally different. Therefore, this proposal will
investigate my hypothesis that LTP versus LTD mechanisms are regulated by structurally distinct features within
CaMKII holoenzymes. The approach will utilize several CaMKII “structural mutants” that have disrupted
holoenzyme structure (hexamers, dimers, and monomers). These mutants will be used as tools to define the
spatiotemporal dynamics of autophosphorylation within holoenzymes and the subunit stoichiometry and
geometry required for GluN2B binding. The results of this proposal will provide insight into how molecular signal
computation underlying the LTP versus LTD decision is encoded within CaMKII holoenzymes."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide due to its heterogeneity
and complex mechanisms of pathogenesis. Clinical outcomes following TBI are determined by the nature and
severity of the primary injury as well as activation of the peripheral immune response. This project will: a)
establish protocols to generate validated human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived brain endothelial
cell (BECs), pericytes (PCs) and astrocytes (ACs) that form a neurovascular unit (NVU), b) develop a novel 3D
perfused blood / blood-brain barrier (BBB) interface model together with patient-derived plasma proteins and
immune cells, and c) examine the effects of blood components circulating in TBI patients on the NVU function.
In preliminary studies and recent publications, we have: (i) developed strategies using RNA or viral-induced
transcription factors (TFs) to reprogram somatic cells into iPSCs, (ii) differentiate iPSC-derived cells into BECs
and validate their identity using multiple approaches, (iii) generate brain organoids that incorporate blood
vessels, (iv) develop brain-on-a-chip models that incorporate blood components and flow. Building upon these
studies, we hypothesize that this multi-disciplinary approach will establish a novel perfused blood-BBB interface
3D model to evaluate the mechanisms by which blood components (plasma proteins, immune cells) impair the
human NVU after TBI. We will address this hypothesis with three aims. For the R61 phase of the proposal in
Aim 1, we will generate, characterize and validate iPSC-derived mature human NVU-forming cells by optimizing
the published protocols using miRs and BBB-specific TF modulation, and verify their molecular identity and
biological function. In Aim 2 (R61 phase), we will establish vascularized and perfused 3D BBB models with
physiological relevant flow rates using a combination of BECs, PCs and ACs, ready-to-use brain-on-a-chip
devises and labelled plasma metabolites or proteins. In parallel we will develop vascularized and perfused brain
organoids with physiological relevant flow and labelled blood components. In these models, we will characterize
BBB function using transcriptomics, cell biological, imaging and functional studies. For the R33 phase of the
project (Aim 3), we will analyze the effects of blood components (plasma or immune cells) on: a) BBB cell biology;
b) transport of labelled metabolites, plasma proteins, drugs or immune cells across the BBB; c) BEC - PC
interactions, PC contractility, pericyte or astrocyte coverage of blood vessels, astrocyte Ca++ signaling; and d)
immune cell trafficking (macrophage, T cells) across the BBB and effects of immune cells on the blood/BBB 3D
model. The proposed studies will establish an innovative perfused blood-BBB 3D interface model that will allow
us to examine the relationship between blood components (plasma, immune cells) and the BBB in healthy
conditions and brain injury. This model may facilitate discovery or analysis of potential biomarkers and evaluate
the efficacy of potential therapeutics that target the systemic inflammatory-driven neuropathophysiology in TBI."

 Early life interactions between commensal microbes and the developing immune system have formative
effects on human health and susceptibility to chronic inflammatory disease. Previous studies from the host lab
and other groups have demonstrated that our microbial symbionts can tune skin-resident T cell function,
especially during the neonatal window. However, comparatively little is known about how commensals influence
cutaneous myeloid immunity in early life. Dr. Dhariwala has found that commensal microbes influence the
composition and function of the myeloid compartment in neonatal skin. Specifically, commensal microbes drive
the accumulation of a population of Ly6ChiMHC-IIlo inflammatory monocytes in neonatal skin. These cells have
traditionally been studied as primary mediators of inflammation in response to infection or for their ability to fill
vacant tissue myeloid niches. However, Dr. Dhariwala’s preliminary studies demonstrate a previously unexplored
regulatory immune imprinting role for neonatal skin monocytes. To dissect the molecular mechanisms that
underpin this phenomenon, we will employ a combination of transgenic mouse models, high throughput assays
like mass cytometry and single cell RNA sequencing along with novel ex vivo translational tools. Studies
proposed in this application will (Aim 1) Dissect the mechanism(s) by which commensal microbes influence
monocyte recruitment and function in neonatal skin, (Aim 2) Elucidate the mechanism(s) by which neonatal
monocytes contribute to skin immune homeostasis and (Aim 3) Functionally elucidate the role of neonatal
monocytes in human skin. Results from this cross-disciplinary approach will benefit our understanding of early
immune development and lay the groundwork for next generation therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases.
 The proposed research and training plan will build on Dr. Dhariwala’s strengths in the fields of microbiology,
immunology and translational science. Leveraging tools he has established in the host lab, such as mass
cytometry, ex vivo functional assays in human skin and manipulation of skin-resident myeloid cell populations in
murine models, along with studies like metabolomics proposed in this application will not only elevate the project
but also advance his training. His scientific and career progress will be well supported by a strong mentorship
team including Drs. Tiffany Scharschmidt, Clifford Lowell, Michael Rosenblum and Peter Turnbaugh.
Additionally, through presentations at local and international conferences along with formal and informal training
at UCSF Dr. Dhariwala will advance his transition to independence. Promising preliminary data, a strong training
plan and an excellent training environment will allow Dr. Dhariwala to carve out a niche for himself and establish
an independent research program studying the influence of commensal microbes on myeloid immune
development in neonatal barrier tissues."

Genetic discovery for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder lags behind that in other areas of medicine, where the
identification of mutations responsible for familial forms of major disorders has yielded extraordinary biological
insights. However, recent successes in gene identification from both rare and common variant analyses indicate
what the field needs to do to catch up: expand the size, diversity and scope of genetic studies. Indeed, NIMH
recognized this need, issuing PAR-20-027, “Genetic Architecture of Mental Disorders in Ancestrally Diverse
Populations.” In response to this call, we will create the Populations Underrepresented in Mental illness
Association Studies (PUMAS) Project, an international collaboration of investigators from the US, South America
and Africa with the strongest track record of large-scale psychiatric genetic research in Latino and African
populations, along with several of the field’s leaders in genetic data generation and analysis. PUMAS will be well
powered to discover new genes for schizophrenia and bipolar; it will dramatically increase the diversity of genetic
discovery efforts, an important step towards reducing health disparities; and it will expand the scope of psychiatric
genomics by generating low-pass whole genome sequencing for 120,000 samples (which we will analyze
together with 22,500 samples already sequenced by our team). Through these efforts we will also discover
similarities and differences in genetic architecture of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries and
environments. The Aims of the PUMAS project are to: 1) Build the PUMAS sample bank of schizophrenia cases,
bipolar cases and controls from Africa and from admixed populations in the Americas, achieving a total sample
of 183,500 (88,600 cases and 94,900 matched population controls) by recruiting 17,000 new cases and 16,500
controls. 2) Generate low-pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) data and variant calls on 40,000 cases of
schizophrenia, 40,000 cases of bipolar disorder and 40,000 matched controls from African, Native American and
admixed ancestries b) perform extensive sample and variant quality control. 3) a) Systematically analyze the
combined dataset to power discovery of the genetic basis of schizophrenia and bipolar across diverse ancestries
and down the allele frequency spectrum; and b) through portals and browsers, share the data and results of the
genetic studies with the world. The PUMAS 120,000 sample WGS dataset, together with data for 22,500
previously sequenced admixed (AA+EA) samples, provides sufficient statistical power for genetic discovery for
SZ, BP, and combined across diverse ancestries. Our study will identify new genes and loci, increase the
precision of fine-mapping of known loci, and form the foundational knowledge base for polygenic risk scores
(PRS) of global value."

with HP experience a profound lack of knowledge about the disease, uncertainty, intense hypervigilance,
feelings of anxiety and depression, and marked disruption to their lifestyle and home environment. HRQOL is

10897294,"Arrhythmias result from disorganized electrical signals within the heart leading to irregular contractions and are
a leading cause of death in the US. Ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation are the most serious arrhythmias
resulting in 300k annual US deaths, followed by 130k US deaths due to atrial fibrillation (AF). With a
prevalence of 6M in the US, AF is the most common arrhythmia, resulting in 750k annual US hospitalizations.
AF-associated medical costs will exceed $50B by 2035. AF therapies first rely on pharmaceuticals to prevent
blood clots and to restore rhythm. If these approaches fail, electrophysiology (EP) procedures are performed
which pass electrical currents (or coolants) through the catheter’s tip to destroy tissues disrupting proper
electrical signals. However, manual catheters rely on complex tension-wire designs operated from a meter
away which makes effective catheter control difficult, leading to injury and AF recurrence.
 Robotic platforms have struggled to improve catheter control for decades. Most robotic systems manipulate
standard manual catheters; however, learning curves remain high and catheter tip control is unimproved.
Magnet-based systems that use magnetic catheters improve control; however, the systems are impractically
large, difficult to use, and require a custom angiography suite. Because all existing robotic solutions remain
prohibitively expensive, such systems are found only in a limited number of high-volume centers despite that
more than 80% of all hospitals providing ablation are lower-volume centers. What is needed is an affordable
and workflow-friendly robotic technology that improves catheter control and enables expertise within high-
volume EP centers to be remotely shared with lower-volume centers for training and procedural support.
 UNandUP’s MAP-EP (Magnetic Assistive Platform for EP) system controls novel linkage-based magnetic
catheters using a magnet mass 50X smaller than previously possible. As a result, the MAP-EP system can be
installed into existing digital angiography suites without the need for a new c-arm or room construction.
Because energy is not expended fighting catheter restoring forces, low magnetic fields achieve stable,
accurate, and precise heart wall contact. The technology complements standard EP workflows, is affordable
for low-volume EP centers, and provides telerobotic access to expertise within high-volume centers.
 In the Phase I effort, a prototype magnet workstation was constructed, novel magnetic materials were
developed to manufacture smaller and more complex magnets than previously possible, and prototype
catheters were successfully built and assessed using known heart phantoms. I-Corps and TABA participation
were completed, and FDA pre-submission meetings were held in support of mapping [510(k)], ablation (PMA),
and Early Feasibility Studies. For the proposed effort, UNandUP will develop preclinical versions of its system.
Efficacy studies will be completed using known beating heart phantoms. Biocompatibility testing and large-
animal safety and feasibility studies will be conducted following published methods."
10897223,"ABSTRACT
By the age of 5, children in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are exposed to nearly five times more
antibiotics than high-income country children. Although improved access to antibiotics has been a major driver
of mortality declines, most antibiotics administered to children are clinically unnecessary. Excessive use can
lead to adverse events, drug toxicity, and harm the gut microbiota and immune system. It also contributes to
antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the costs of which are disproportionately borne by children in LMICs. Although
widespread clinically unnecessary use of antibiotics in LMICs is well-documented, substantial knowledge gaps
remain regarding the drivers of overuse among children and how these are linked to the dynamics of
resistance and disease. This knowledge is required to design policies and interventions that appropriately
balance access and overuse. This K01 Award proposal focuses on identifying incentives that caregivers and
providers face to treat children with antibiotics and how these are related to the development of resistance. My
career goal is to become independent scholar working at the intersection of economics and infectious disease
epidemiology with a focus on research to inform AMR policies in LMICs. The proposed training activities build
on my background as an economist and experience conducting population-based experimental research with
further training in infectious disease epidemiology, the biomedical underpinnings of antimicrobial resistance,
machine learning techniques, and agent-based modeling of infectious disease and social systems. Aligned
with my training goals, my research program aims to integrate concepts from economics and infectious
disease epidemiology and to use state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to examine the complex
relationship between factors driving demand for antibiotics, disease, and the development of resistance. To do
so, I will draw on existing micro-level data from a survey of clinicians and households across 360 rural villages
in southwest China as well as new experimental data on the prescription practices of clinicians and
pharmacists in the same area. My specific research aims are 1) to experimentally evaluate the prescribing
practices of clinicians and pharmacists for pediatric diarrhea cases; 2) to estimate the influence of clinician
advice on antibiotic use in children, and how this varies with patient, clinician, and community characteristics;
and 3) to develop an agent-based model of health-seeking behavior, antibiotic use, and bacterial resistance for
pediatric diarrhea cases in rural China and use this model to conduct counterfactual simulations to prioritize
interventions for future study. My mentoring team has specialized training in infectious disease epidemiology,
the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance, machine learning, and agent-based modeling as well as
experience leading interdisciplinary teams. This research will generate new insights that can inform policies to
better balance access to antibiotics and overuse. The training and research proposed in this K01 award will
support the development of future R-level proposals to study the design of AMR policies in LMICs."

fraught with excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure. AI has potential to support ED clinician decisions
by exploiting large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to aid prognosis, extract signal from noise, and
reduce untoward variability in practice. Despite AI’s fervent promotion, translation to practice is rare and means
to incorporate AI that is trustworthy, transparent, and explainable in the ED are unknown.
AKI is an important target for AI-driven predictive modeling. It is prevalent and strongly associated with adverse
outcomes including dialysis and death, yet is under-recognized and therefore under-treated. In addition, many
ED treatments inadvertently promote the progression of AKI and kidney disease. AKI prevention is achievable
with evidence-based CDS at the point of care. We will use our AI-driven model, with proven capacity for early
and reliable AKI risk estimation, to achieve the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven algorithm for promotion of AKI-focused clinical decision-making in the ED.
We will leverage previously developed AKI surveillance and prediction tools to generate a unified EHR-based
algorithm that empowers ED clinician prevention of kidney disease progression.
Aim 2: Translate the AI algorithm to an AKI-CDS system to enable in-depth study of Clinician-AI
interactions in the ED. We will establish end-user requirements while creating data collection instruments to
examine AI in the ED. Both efforts will support the development of the AKI-CDS system to pilot and investigate
ED clinician perceptions of AI trustworthiness and explainability in preparation for multi-site implementation.
Aim 3: Perform a multi-site effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the AKI-CDS system in the ED.
We will implement the AI-driven CDS system across three ED study sites using a pragmatic investigational
framework to perform effectiveness and implementation evaluations in parallel.
The research proposed will generate new knowledge and tools to advance the study of AI in the ED, and will
result in a scalable CDS product with the capacity to improve the quality of kidney care delivered to more than
1 million patients affected by AKI in the US each year."
10896983,"Dr. Kim’s long-term goal is to be a VA physician investigator, elucidating mechanisms of diabetic bone
disease in order to reduce fracture risk in people with diabetes. There is growing recognition that bone disease
is a complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In T2DM, hip fracture risk is increased by more than a
third, and after fracture, individuals with T2DM have higher rates of postoperative complications and a higher
risk of mortality. Fracture risk is elevated even after controlling for falls, and hip fractures occur despite
preserved or higher bone mineral density (BMD). The fat within the bone marrow is proposed to play a
pathogenic role in diabetic bone disease, as fat and bone are intimately related within the marrow
microenvironment. Adipocytes and osteoblasts share a common mesenchymal stem cell precursor, and
adipogenesis could occur at the expense of osteoblastogenesis. Indeed, greater levels of marrow fat content
are associated with lower BMD and higher fracture risk. However, it is unknown whether marrow fat can be
manipulated to improve diabetic bone disease. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) positively correlates with higher
levels of marrow fat, so enhanced glycemic control might normalize marrow fat and improve bone outcomes.
Given the widespread prevalence of diabetes and the medical and economic costs of fractures, there is an
urgent need to understand diabetic bone disease to identify targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies.
 During the Career Development Award-2 (CDA-2) period, Dr. Kim’s goal is to acquire the training and
implement the studies needed to understand the effects of improved glycemic control on marrow fat and bone
health. She will gain expertise in valuable clinical research and translational methods that will position her to
become a leader in the field of diabetic bone disease. Dr. Kim will enroll and follow 75 Veterans with poorly
controlled T2DM (HbA1c 8.5-12.0%) who are working with their clinicians to improve glycemic control. She will
determine the effects of improved glycemic control on bone marrow fat (Aim 1) and the relationship between
changes in marrow fat with bone quality and mass (Aim 2). Pursuit of these aims will involve critical training in
the design and implementation of a prospective cohort study. Dr. Kim will use advanced and sensitive imaging
modalities (including magnetic resonance spectroscopy, high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed
tomography) to assess marrow fat and bone outcomes at baseline and then after 1 year of intensified medical
management. Dr. Kim will also use cutting edge translational methods to explore the role of osteoblast
differentiation as a pathway linking marrow fat and bone outcomes (Aim 3). This will include characterizing
circulating osteoblast progenitor cells by flow cytometry and evaluating expression of osteoblast differentiation
genes. Training in advanced diabetes and lipid metabolism will allow Dr. Kim to interpret these findings and
gain important insights into the pathogenesis of diabetic bone disease. This research is expected to advance
understanding of marrow fat behavior, which may lead to targeted preventive and therapeutic strategies for
diabetic bone disease and osteoporosis. Dr. Kim has assembled a diverse mentorship team comprised of
experts in osteoporosis, metabolism, epidemiology, biostatistics, and radiology. Her training will involve a
combination of individual tutorials with her mentors and scientific advisors, hands-on experience, and formal
coursework. The proposed research will provide Dr. Kim with preliminary data for a larger and longer-term
prospective study of diabetic bone disease, which she will propose in a Merit Review application submitted
before the end of the CDA-2 period. Dr. Kim is committed to improving the health care of Veterans through
clinical research, and with her proposed research and training, she will develop a thriving research program at
the VA."
10896984,"ABSTRACT
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a chronic condition with high morbidity and economic burden. Aberrant host
responses to dysbiotic enteric microbiota are central to the pathogenesis of CD. Consistent with this concept,
T-cell subsets closely aligned with the enteric microbiota, such as Th17 cells, are strongly implicated in CD.
Although biologics have transformed the clinical management of CD, > 50% of patients eventually fail medical
therapies and progress to surgery. Thus, characterizing pathogenic T-cell pathways is necessary to develop
new therapies and identify prognostic biomarkers in CD. Tissue-resident memory T-cells (TRM) are a recently
described subset of tissue-restricted non-circulating memory T-cells. They are antigen-specific and enriched at
sites with high microbial burden, including the intestine. These features make TRM excellent candidates to link
enteric dysbiosis with aberrant host responses. Indeed, we have reported that CD4+ TRM with a pathogenic
Th17 signature are abundant in the intestine in CD and are enriched in CD compared to non-Inflammatory
Bowel Disease (IBD) controls. Moreover, these enriched CD4+ TRM express the transcriptional repressor PR
zinc finger domain (PRDM)1. In turn, knockdown of PRDM1 with silencing RNA results in the upregulation of
the key cell trafficking molecule sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1). As S1PR1 is by definition
suppressed in TRM, this implies that PRDM1 promotes retention of pathogenic CD4+ TRM in the intestine in CD
via transcriptional control of cell trafficking molecules. Furthermore, we find that IL-15 (which is enriched in
CD), promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines by CD4+ TRM similar to the canonical pro-inflammatory
cytokines IL-1β and IL-23. Finally, compatible with the possibility that the dysbiosis in CD drives pathogenic
CD4+ TRM, humanized gnotobiotic IL-10-/- mice with CD-microbiota develop severe colitis relative to non-IBD
control microbiota colonized counterparts. Moreover, the majority of colitogenic mucosal Th17 cells in these
mice bear TRM markers. Thus, our data indicate that the CD microbiota induced pathogenic CD4+ TRM, which
are regulated by PRDM1 and IL-15. Herein, we propose to 1) determine the mechanism and predictive
capacity of PRDM1 in CD, 2) delineate the role of IL-15 in CD4+ TRM and 3) using humanized gnotobiotic mice
colonized with microbiota from CD patients and healthy controls, define the extent to which CD microbiota
induces pathogenic CD4+ TRM."
10897001,"Abstract
HIV/AIDS continues to be a major global health issue, and chronic liver disease has become a major cause of
HIV-mortality. Several contributing factors are recognized including hepatotoxicity of anti-HIV drugs,
coinfection of hepatitis viruses and widespread alcohol use. The likelihood of concurrent use of other addictive
substances such
as fentanyl is high. Excessive alcohol use has been linked directly to increased HIV viral
load, engagement in HIV-risk behaviors, and poor adherence in HIV prevention interventions. In addition,
alcohol and fentanyl are known to alter the functionality of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters, critical
determinants for the efficacy and safety of anti-HIV drugs. Indeed, we have shown that ethanol (alcohol)
exposure decreased the hydrolysis of
tenofovir alafenamide fumarate (TAF) and produced a new metabolite:
ethyl TAF. This metabolite is a hybrid molecule with part from TAF and part from ethanol. TAF is a new
version of TDF (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) with decreased organ toxicity, and both tenofovir prodrugs are
hydrolyzed and followed by phosphorylation to produce therapeutically active metabolite. TAF is hydrolyzed by
carboxylesterase-1 (CES1), while TDF is hydrolyzed predominantly by CES2. TAF and TDF are listed in
~75% anti-HIV regimens used for both pre-exposure prophylaxis
(PrEP) and treatment as prevention
(TasP). Our Preliminary Study has also shown that fentanyl increased the expression of chemokine co-
receptors and led to increased HIV infection. The central hypothesis of this project is that metabolism-based
interactions of tenofovir drugs with alcohol +/- fentanyl produce signature changes that reliably indicate efficacy
and safety of tenofovir regimens and serve as a foundation for developing adherence-monitoring and
PrEP/TasP intervention strategies. The Specific Aims are: (1) to characterize metabolite signatures and
mechanistic biomarkers, and (2) to ascertain the significance of alcohol +/- fentanyl-altered metabolism. To
determine the metabolite signatures specific to alcohol +/- fentanyl, human primary hepatocytes and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
will be treated with a tenofovir-regimen in the presence or absence of
alcohol (+/- fentanyl); the metabolite signatures will be determined by LC-MS/MS. The altered metabolite
signatures will be ascertained by in vivo studies. Transcriptome analysis will be performed at both tissue (e.g.,
PBMC) and single cell level (selected samples) to identify mechanistic biomarkers. To establish the
significance, hepatocytes and PBMCs will be incubated with a tenofovir-regimen with or without alcohol +/-
fentanyl, and viral load and cytotoxicity will be monitored. The connection of metabolite signatures and
biomarkers with efficacy and safety will be ascertained in vivo. Finally, PBMCs from HIV-negative patients
exposed to PrEP, PrEP+alcohol or PrEP+alcohol/fentanyl will be tested against HIV infection ex vivo. The
combination of in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo study design ensures high scientific rigor."
10897002,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many age-related neurodegenerative diseases—including Alzheimer's disease (AD)—are associated with
misfolded protein deposition that promote inflammatory responses, neuronal dysfunction, and cognitive deficits.
We have recently identified that aging and AD both display impaired meningeal lymphatic function, which
ultimately results in impaired CSF drainage to deep cervical lymph nodes, as well as CSF perfusion into the
brain parenchyma, collectively promoting waste build up and A-induced pathologies in AD mice. Our preliminary
data demonstrate that aging is also associated with the accumulation of IFNγ-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells
in the dural meninges, closely associated with the meningeal lymphatics. IFNγ signaling represents a
transcriptional hallmark of aged meningeal lymphatics and augmentation of this axis in young mice attenuates
their functional drainage of CSF. We therefore hypothesize that during aging and in AD, elevated expression of
IFNγ from meningeal CD4 and CD8 T cells impairs meningeal lymphatic function function via direct signaling on
their IFNγ receptors, leading to meningeal lymphatic deterioration. Such deterioration later results in impaired
brain perfusion by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), subsequently leading to the accumulation of debris and worsening
progression of AD. We further hypothesize that using cytokine neutralizing antibodies, we can preserve
meningeal lymphatics in aged mice and prevent or reduce the age-associated brain dysfunctions and augment
existing immunotherapy strategies in AD patients. Addressing our hypotheses of this proposal will illuminate
mechanistic pathways underlying age-related meningeal lymphatic dysfunction, and identify new promising
avenues for therapeutic interventions intended to reduce AD-related pathology."
10897868,"ABSTRACT
 (Project 3)
Role of Proline Metabolism in Regulation of Mammalian Cardiomyocyte Proliferation
Heart failure progression is a complex biological process that is precipitated by the maladaptive myocardial
response to injury, compounded by failure of the adult heart to replace lost or damaged cardiomyocytes. Our lab
has previously outlined the regenerative capacity of the newborn mammalian heart and outlined several
mechanisms that regulate this process. Specifically, we demonstrate that the endogenous regenerative capacity
of the newborn heart is mediated by proliferation of preexisting cardiomyocytes and is lost when cardiomyocytes
exit cell cycle within a few days after birth. We described several fundamental mechanisms that regulate cell
cycle exit of cardiomyocytes, including spontaneous DNA damage that occurs as a result of increased
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Subsequently, we demonstrated that gradual severe systemic hypoxia
can induce cardiomyocyte proliferation in the adult mouse heart and is associated with decreased DNA damage.
These finding suggest that oxygen metabolism is an upstream signal that mediates postnatal cardiomyocyte cell
cycle in the postnatal heart. Intriguingly, we found that proline metabolism was markedly upregulated in
regenerative cardiomyocytes under hypoxic conditions. From a mechanistic standpoint, we want to better
understand the factors that regulate cardiomyocyte proliferation under hypoxia. Therefore, this proposal will
examine the role of proline metabolism in regulation of cardiomyocyte adaptation and proliferation under hypoxia
in both mice and pigs. In addition, we will examine the role of Hypoxia inducible factors (Hifs) in regulation of
proline metabolism and cardiomyocyte proliferation in the neonatal heart and under hypoxic conditions."

(University of California, Berkeley)
SUMMARY
The Administrative Core (Core A) will be responsible for coordinating Program Project (P01) partners by
providing an umbrella infrastructure that will manage overall operations. Effective scientific management and
coordination by the Administrative Core will give direction, oversight, and quality assurance for each Project
and Core's research activities and will maximize collaboration and exchange among all participating members.
Core A will achieve this by ensuring a dynamic interaction among all researchers in the Program Project,
specifically, by fostering and facilitating the timely exchange of information, necessary reagents and protocols
and sharing of data and will assume financial responsibility for the costs associated with these activities. Core
A will promote and mediate regular communication and will facilitate the logistics for scheduled meetings,
monthly P01-wide teleconferences, and ad hoc calls. It will also be responsible for arranging and facilitating an
annual in-person meeting at the UC Berkeley campus where the overall P01 Director, Project 1, Core A, and
Core C are headquartered. In addition, Core A will provide fiscal oversight and general administrative,
compliance, and budgetary support for the overall Program Project in coordination with all the administrative
designees from the partner institutions. Finally, Core A will coordinate reports to the NIH, ensure compliance
with NIH and local institutional requirements, including an ongoing consortium-wide MTA and serve as the
primary contact between the P01, the NIAID program officer, and other NIAID staff. Thus, Core A plays a

10897996,"Computational Biology and Statistical Modeling Core (CORE B)
(University of California, Berkeley)
SUMMARY
The Computational Biology and Statistical Modeling Core (Core B) will provide essential services to
individual Projects and the Program Project (P01) as a whole by providing statistical support at each stage of
research. Critically, Core B will enable the Projects to address key themes of the P01 by applying unifying
computational biology, statistical, and machine learning approaches to study natural and vaccine-induced
dengue humoral and cellular immunity. In Aim 1, Core B will conduct epidemiological analyses of the natural
dengue virus (DENV) infection and dengue vaccine cohorts to inform the immunological studies proposed by
Projects 1, 2, and 3. For the Nicaragua Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study, we will work closely with Core C to
investigate dengue incidence before and after the introduction of Zika as well as how changing DENV
transmission intensity affects dengue disease severity. For the Cebu Dengvaxia® cohort, we will estimate DENV
infection and dengue disease incidence stratified by baseline DENV serostatus and vaccination history to support
the immune correlates studies proposed by Project 2. We will also compare these two pediatric cohorts to
understand how geography, DENV transmission intensity, ZIKV infection history, and serotype prevalence affect
dengue disease. Phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses will be conducted for all DENV isolates from both
cohorts. In Aim 2, we will support each Project individually and conduct cross-Project analyses to identify
immune markers that correlate with protection against symptomatic dengue and pathogenesis of severe dengue
disease. This aim encompasses immune correlates of natural and vaccine-induced DENV immunity. We will
work with each Project to design case-control studies to test how DENV-specific serum antibody, B cell, and T
cell characteristics predict distinct clinical outcomes. Core B will analyze the multi-dimensional datasets
produced by the Projects to classify clinical outcomes using straightforward machine learning methods such as
generalized linear models, flexible approaches such as random forests, and methods that are robust to outliers
such as support vector machines, all with regularization to reduce model complexity. In Aim 3, we will support
the Projects in studying children who have experienced natural primary and secondary DENV infections to
identify immune markers that predict maintenance anti-DENV immunity. We will use regression models to
determine how antibody and helper T cell characteristics measured soon after infection predict both the
magnitude and the durability of cross-reactive and type-specific antibody responses. We will then incorporate
the predictive immune markers into linear and more flexible mixed-effects regression models to fit antibody
dynamics following primary and secondary DENV infection. Parallel analyses will be conducted for baseline
seronegative and seropositive vaccine recipients, enabling direct comparison of the determinants of immune
longevity following natural DENV infection and vaccination. We also compare the systems serology measures
performed on post-primary, pre-secondary, and post-secondary natural DENV infection samples in the same
individuals to test for changes in antibody antigen recognition and Fc effector characteristics. Collectively, these
three Aims are critical to the research proposed in the Projects and will work toward the overarching P01 goal to
identify predictive and mechanistic anti-DENV immune characteristics that provide long-term protection against
dengue disease.!"

(UC Berkeley, University of Michigan, Sustainable Sciences Institute)
SUMMARY
The Clinical and Data Management Core (Core C) will be instrumental for the success of the P01 Program.
First, the Core will continue to conduct the Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Managua, Nicaragua. This cohort
study is the longest continuous cohort study of dengue and as such is an invaluable source of samples and
clinical data from children with natural repeat dengue virus (DENV) infections. Both retrospectively and
prospectively collected samples and data will be available to the P01 Projects. Core C will oversee all aspects
of running the Cohort Study including enrollment, sample collection and storage, data collection and
management, quality control, provision of medical care, and human subjects documentation. Second, Core C
will coordinate the compilation of clinical data and the distribution of samples available from the P01 Program
dengue studies in Nicaragua and the Philippines, where a cohort study of children vaccinated with the
Dengvaxia® dengue vaccine is ongoing. To this end, the Core will design, maintain, update and oversee the
P01 Program databases, which will include clinical data, sample characteristics and availability. Core C will
provide tailored data sets and assist in selection of analysis-specific biological specimens, ensuring efficient data
sharing and sample distribution through the implementation of high levels of quality control. This will include
having a data manager at the University of Michigan (UM) who will compile the data from the clinical sites and
use it to assemble data sets, including the creation of any necessary variables for P01 Program sites. Core C
personnel at UC Berkeley will be responsible for receiving samples from Nicaragua, maintaining an inventory,
and distributing the samples to P01 Projects in response to requests and in coordination with the data manager
at UM. Third, the Core will maintain a copy of immunological data generated through the Projects 1-3 and Core
B and will deposit data into ImmPort. P01 investigators will be able to submit data for upload to and download
data from the database, facilitating the flow of information across all P01 Program partners. Aim 1 is to continue
conducting the community-based prospective Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study in Managua, Nicaragua. Aim 2 is
to coordinate clinical data compilation, integration and distribution, and shipment of clinical samples, and to
perform phylogenetic sequencing. Aim 3 is to manage data generated through the P01 and to deposit
immunological data generated through the P01 Projects and Cores into ImmPort. Taken together, the Clinical
and Data Management Core will play an essential role in the P01 Program by providing data and samples to
scientific Projects for the ultimate purpose of identifying both natural and vaccine-induced immune correlates of

10897998,"PROJECT 1: Quality of B Cell and Antibody Responses to Natural Dengue Virus Infections
(University of California, Berkeley)
SUMMARY
The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans,
with ~390 million infections annually and over 3 billion people worldwide at risk of infection. Yet, no treatment is
currently approved for use in humans, and the only registered vaccine is problematic. The overall approach of
Project 1 is to take advantage of unique Nicaraguan sample sets to address complex questions about DENV
antibody and B cell immunology in a relevant clinical and epidemiological context. The Project is designed to
analyze the antibody/B cell immune profile in relation to infection outcome, disease severity, and antibody
dynamics. Each aim also addresses specific fundamental questions in dengue immunology. The overall
hypothesis of this project is that the quality of B cell and antibody responses, as detemined by the repertoire
and characteristics of the antibodies and B cells, impacts outcome of subsequent DENV infection as well as the
long-term antibody response. The focus is on characterizing the repertoire and dynamics of the antibody
response before and after primary and secondary infections in more detail as new state-of-the-art tools become
available in our P01 program. Each aim derives from findings and reagents arising from the current P01.
Importantly, we integrate classical state-of-the-art molecular genetics and systems serology approaches
to comprehensively examine both antigen-specific and Fc characteristics and effector functions that
predict protection or pathogenesis with unprecedented resolution. The proposed research is possible due
to the ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study (2004-present), a community-based prospective cohort study in
Managua, Nicaragua, following ~3,700 children, now in its 15th year, and the Dengue Hospital-based Study
(2005-present) in Managua, which together enable investigation of pre-infection samples, documented repeat
DENV infections, and long-term B cell/antibody responses. This project is highly synergistic with the other
Projects in this P01 by sharing similar samples (Projects 3 & 4) and methods and reagents (Project 2) and
integrating computational biological analyses and statistical models (Core B) of the B cell/antibody response
during DENV natural infections with the T cell response to DENV (Project 3) and with the immune response
obtained after live attenuated DENV vaccination (Project 2). Project 1 Aim 1 will define the complete repertoire
of type-specific antibodies in dengue-endemic populations in Asia and the Americas, define the footprint of major
antigenic sites, and investigate the effect of genotype on epitope recognition in polyclonal sera. Aim 2 will
determine predictors of clinical outcome in terms of antibody repertoire and Fc effector function, in relation to
inapparent vs. symptomatic infection as well as mild vs. severe dengue disease. Aim 3 will examine
epidemiological, antigen-specific, and Fc effector-driven predictors of antibody magnitude and kinetics after
primary and secondary DENV infection and will compare the two. This discovery approach willl yield mechanistic
insights into immune function. Overall, this project will identify antibody/B cell correlates of protection and
pathogenesis, as well as of magnitude and durability of the antibody response, which should be useful for
development and evaluation of dengue vaccines."
10897869,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Amputation and mortality rates are extraordinarily high for patients living with both advanced peripheral
arterial disease, or critical limb ischemia (CLI), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Treatment choices for
patients with CLI include catheter-based procedures (e.g. vascular stenting), surgery (e.g. bypass), primary
amputation, or symptom control alone (e.g. pain management and wound care). Overall, CLI has dismal
outcomes with a 25% mortality and a 30% major amputation rate at one year from diagnosis. Limited data
suggest even worse outcomes for patients with ESRD – for example, approximately 50% mortality at 18
months. The existing literature on outcomes is limited by small sample sizes, short follow-up, and a focus on
only two of the treatment options, catheter-based interventions and surgery. Patients with ESRD and CLI are
often faced with difficult treatment decisions that are complicated by a lack of 1) robust real-world evidence on
outcomes and 2) clinical care guidelines. Shared decision-making often relies on these types of information.
 ESRD is a life-limiting disease and treatment of CLI is resource-intensive. Nevertheless, there are no
existing cardiovascular or nephrology society guidelines regarding CLI treatment in patients with ESRD.
Knowledge of outcomes of CLI treatment in patients with ESRD, factors affecting CLI treatment selection, and
guidelines to direct care would unequivocally improve care by helping to align patient values and preferences
with treatment decisions. Owing to these gaps in knowledge, I propose a mixed methods approach using the
national Medicare data 2017-2019 to understand 1) factors affecting treatment selection, and 2) traditional and
patient-centered outcomes after treatment of CLI in patients with ESRD, complemented by 3) a Delphi panel of
expert health care providers and patients to help inform the establishment of care guidelines and identification
of research priorities.
 In addition to helping develop critical data on patients with ESRD and CLI, this proposal will be an
essential step in my development as an independent investigator. My long-term career goals are to develop a
research program focusing on outcomes of treatment and decision-making surrounding peripheral arterial
disease. I hope to advance the field of vascular surgery health services research to improve patient outcomes
and aid physicians and patients in aligning decision-making with patient goals and values. This proposal will
immediately contribute to my short-term career objectives: increasing expertise with use of Medicare fee-for-
service claims data, understanding the practice of nephrology as it applies to ESRD and comorbid conditions
such as CLI, learning relevant advanced quantitative and qualitative techniques, and improving grant writing,
leadership, and other career development skills. This proposal will take place in the resource-rich environment
of the University of Florida College of Medicine under the guidance of an expert mentoring team."

10897872,"Dystonia is characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that cause twisting movements and postures. Many
dystonias are more common in females than in males yet the mechanisms underlying these sex differences are
largely unexplored. Basal ganglia dysfunction is consistently implicated across many forms of dystonia. The
major input structure of the basal ganglia is the striatum where estrogen exerts neuromodulatory effects. In fact,
the physiological properties of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) are known to vary depending on biological
sex and estrous cycle phase. Direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project to the internal globus pallidus to promote
movement. Indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) project to the external globus pallidus to inhibit movement. Although
dSPNs and iSPNs are segregated into separate pathways, they act in concert to mediate and refine movements.
In dystonia patients, this coordinated activity is disrupted as functional imaging studies and microelectrode
recordings suggest that both dSPNs and iSPNs are dysfunctional. However, the mechanisms underlying both
SPN pathophysiology and sex differences in dystonia remain unknown.
Several challenges have stymied our ability to understand the pathophysiology and the relationship to biological
sex in dystonia. First, information obtained by studying patients is, by necessity, quite limited. Second, despite
the epidemiological studies demonstrating sex differences in the expression of dystonia, sex as a biological
variable is rarely incorporated into studies examining mechanisms underlying dystonia in patients or animal
models. Third, we lack foundational studies in healthy controls that disentangle the effects of biological sex on
striatal cell types. Indeed, studies characterizing sex differences in normal striatal physiology have not
distinguished between SPN subtypes, while studies examining the molecular properties of dSPNs and iSPNs
have not examined sex as a biological variable. This proposal addresses these gaps in knowledge.
Our understanding of the pathophysiology of dystonia has also been hampered by the lack of animal models
with sexually dimorphic dystonia caused by striatal dysfunction. To address this gap, we created a knockin
mouse model of DOPA-responsive dystonia (DRD). In patients, DRD is female predominant, like many forms of
dystonia in humans. DRD is also a prototype disorder for understanding basal ganglia dysfunction in dystonia In
DRD mice, the striatum plays a central role in mediating dystonia and dSPN and iSPN signaling is disrupted.
Further, the presentation of dystonia in DRD mice is significantly different between males and females and the
dystonia fluctuates with the estrus cycle. Thus, for the first time, it is possible to elucidate the neural code of
dystonia in the context of the mechanisms that drive the sex differences. The Specific Aims are: 1. to determine
the role of ovarian hormones in the expression of dystonia. 2. to identify the molecular signature of dystonia in
dSPNs and iSPNs in male and female DRD mice. 3. to define the pattern of dSPN and iSPN activity underlying
dystonia in male and female DRD mice."
10898047,"Microbial Engineering to Control the Structure and Function of the Gut Microbiome
SUMMARY
The human microbiota, the collection of microbes that live on and in the body, is fully integrated with human
physiology and has been extensively implicated in health and disease. As with all microbial communities, the
summation of environmental, interbacterial, and interkingdom interactions governs both the composition and
function of the microbiota. To date, top-down approaches have been largely used to study microbiome
function, using multi-omics techniques to draw correlations between microbial taxa, genes, and metabolites
with functional properties in different environmental conditions. While these studies contribute a rich set of
hypotheses, bottom-up approaches are required to causally pinpoint the molecular mechanisms through which
microbes interact with their environment, one another, and the host. Synthesis of these mechanistic studies
can further enable predictive models that can be leveraged to engineer microbiomes. Through the
development and application of novel technologies, the research program described herein aims to predictively
engineer ecological responses and metabolic functions in the gut microbiome. A defined microbial community
that mirrors the phylogenetic and functional diversity of natural communities will be used as a testbed to model
the emergent phenomena that arise as a result of interbacterial interactions. Using inspiration from natural
microbial communities to fuel synthetic biology approaches, we will create new tools to allow for genetic
manipulation and expression control in previously intractable gut symbionts. These genetic tools will be applied
to link microbial genes and associated functions with emergent properties of microbial communities, including
resilience to environment perturbations and metabolic networks in the mouse gut. These studies will provide an
experimental framework to pursue investigations into the core functions that structure microbial communities
and to establish design rules for rational microbiome engineering."
10898049,"The objective of this proposal is to determine how high fat diet (HFD)-induced lipid dysregulation links obesity
with increased breast cancer (BC) risk. Epidemiologic studies have confirmed that obesity increases the risk
and mortality of BC, but the molecular mechanisms of obesity/breast cancer associations remain largely
unknown. Our recent studies demonstrate that lipid chaperone A-FABP (adipose fatty acid binding protein, also
known as FABP4) promotes obesity-associated BC by intracellular regulating pro-tumor activity in tumor
associated macrophages (TAMs) and extracellular enhancing aggressive phenotype of BC cells. Thus, A-
FABP might represent a new factor linking dysregulated lipid metabolism with obesity/BC risk. Moreover, we
observed that obesity can be induced by consumption of different types of HFDs, including saturated fats (e.g.
cocoa butter) or unsaturated fats (e.g. olive oil, fish oil). However, only cocoa butter HFD-induced obesity was
associated with increased A-FABP expression and mammary tumor growth. These observations suggest a
novel concept that not all HFD-induced obesity is tumorigenic. Given the undefined links underlying obesity-
induced BC risk, we hypothesized that HFDs rich in saturated fats promote BC risk through A-FABP-mediated
immune and metabolic regulations. As such, A-FABP offers a novel therapeutic target and biomarker for
obesity-associated BC risk. Three complementary but independent specific aims are designed to address our
central hypothesis. Aim 1 is to determine the molecular mechanisms by which different HFDs upregulate A-
FABP for BC risk. We will identify which HFDs promote mammary tumor risk and further dissect how the “bad”
fat drives intracellular A-FABP expression in TAMs and promotes extracellular A-FABP secretion from
adipocytes. Aim 2 is to delineate the downstream metabolic mechanisms of HFD-upregulated A-FABP in BC
risk and immunotherapy. We will delineate how intracellular A-FABP in TAMs regulates the FA oxidation
(FAO)/HIF2α/PD-L1 pathway for immune suppressive function, followed by delineation of how extracellular A-
FABP reprograms lipid metabolic profile in BC cells to enhance their aggressive phenotype. We will further
evaluate if blocking A-FABP activity with our unique humanized antibodies improves A-FABP-induced
metabolic dysregulation and reduces obesity/BC risk. Aim 3 is to evaluate A-FABP as a biomarker for obesity-
associated BC in humans. We will determine the function of A-FABP in peripheral monocytes and measure the
levels of soluble A-FABP in serum and A-FABP expression in tumor stroma using specimens collected from
lean and obese women with or without BC. Successful completion of this proposal will determine the “bad
HFDs” in promoting BC risk and identify the molecular and metabolic mechanisms by which A-FABP mediates
the pro-tumorigenic activities in HFD-induced obesity/BC risk."

10898062,"Project Summary. Detection of cold temperatures is fundamental for survival and allows for avoidance of
harmful environmental conditions that produce skin damage and eventually lead to hypothermia. Despite the
essential nature of cold sensing, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that transmit cold information in
peripheral dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons remain poorly defined. Moreover, peripheral nerve
damage often results in cold allodynia, a hypersensitivity to mildly cold temperatures, and it is unclear whether
the mechanisms that transmit innocuous cold signals are highjacked or if conversely, separate signaling
pathways are engaged. In this proposal, we will address these critical questions by investigating a novel role for
the voltage-gated sodium channel, NaV1.1, in transmitting cold signals in a physiological context, as well as
during pain. Pharmacological inhibition of NaV1.1 in vitro role drastically attenuates action potential firing in
TRPM8-expressing neurons, providing evidence that NaV1.1 may be critical for cold-sensing in vivo. We have
developed new mouse models to test the central hypothesis that NaV1.1 channels transmit cold signals
specifically in TRPM8-expressing DRG neurons and become overactive during pain states that produce cold
allodynia. We will use an innovative combination of conditional knockout mouse lines, diverse somatosensory
behavioral assays, and mechanistic patch-clamp electrophysiological experiments from genetically identified
cold-sensing neurons to generate fundamental insights into peripheral mechanisms of cold transmission in both
health and disease. This work will advance our basic understanding of mammalian thermosensation and define
a new role for NaV1.1 in peripheral nervous system function. Importantly, completion of the proposed work is a
critical step towards my long-term goal of developing a leading research program that tackles basic and
translation questions about how the mammalian nervous system transmits and encodes thermal sensations. To
accomplish this goal, I have developed a detailed career development plan that includes a mentorship
committee, a scientific advisory committee, and targeted professional development activities that will focus on:
1) gaining expertise in behavioral assays and preclinical pain paradigms, 2) acquiring advanced biostatistical
analysis skills to ensure rigorous experimental design, 3) refining my written and oral scientific communication
skills, and 4) learning effective mentorship and lab management. The training received under this award will
uniquely poise me to develop a successful research program in the field of somatosensory neuroscience."
10898063,"Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused
on the study and development of a dyadic behavioral intervention to improve distress (e.g., depression and
anxiety) and communication for older adults coping with cancer and pre-existing mild cognitive impairment (MCI);
and for their family caregiver. While MCI in older adults does not overtly impede function, it can manifest under
conditions of distress. Close to 50% of older adults with co-occurring cancer and MCI are at vulnerable risk to
experience high levels of distress (e.g., depression and anxiety) which can negatively affect their sense of
independence, communication of what matters most for their care, and overall quality of life. Their family
caregivers may experience equal or even higher levels of distress when managing their loved one’s cancer
symptoms and cognitive deficits. Surprisingly, a large gap exists in the development of dyadic behavioral
interventions to treat distress and improve communication to address both patient and caregiver needs. The
proposed project seeks to address a major gap in the literature and clinical practice for older adults with co-
occurring cancer and MCI, and their family caregiver. The overall objective of this K08 proposal is to develop a
dyadic intervention (created by Dr. Ramos, titled: COPE+), informed by her previous work in individually based
interventions for oncology and palliative care populations, and pilot COPE+ as a novel patient-caregiver dyadic
intervention consisting of distress coping skills, and newly include communication-skills training. The proposed
mentored research activities for this K08 award are to refine and pilot test the dyadic intervention informed by
Family Self-Management Theory. Mentored research training will occur in the context of a focused research
project with three aims: 1) To refine the COPE+ intervention using interviews with patients, caregivers and
providers. 2) To finalize the intervention and study procedures through user testing. 3) To examine the feasibility
and acceptability of COPE+. This K08 application is consistent with NCI’s mission to advance scientific
knowledge of the unique needs of people living with cancer and aligns with the NCI’s Division of Cancer Control
and Population Sciences in helping reduce the burden of the cancer experience via use of behavioral intervention
approaches to enhance quality of life. To become an independent researcher in the field of geriatric oncology
and mental health, Dr. Ramos requires additional training in: 1) qualitative research and geriatric oncology; 2)
recruitment, engagement, and retention of older adults with cancer and MCI, and their family caregivers; 3)
design, develop, and pilot dyadic behavioral interventions; and 4) develop expertise in dissemination and
implementation. Dr. Ramos’ intensive training plan coupled with a team of internationally recognized researchers
in health psychology, geriatrics, health services/implementation science, underrepresented faculty development,
and biostatistics will position her to be a geropsychology leader studying and addressing mental health in older
adult cancer populations and co-occurring MCI."
10898084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Over 1.8 million Americans have rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Compared to the general population these
patients are at an increased risk of developing cancer, especially lymphoma and lung cancer. There has been
a theoretical concern that use of immunosuppressive agents may impair immune responses to tumors placing
patients at risk for developing new cancers and for recurrence of previously treated cancers. These concerns
have made clinicians reluctant to use standard therapies for RA in patients with an active or recently diagnosed
cancer. Although only a limited number of studies have evaluated their safety, they have in fact not shown any
signal of harm from disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in patients with RA and cancer.
However, these studies have numerous limitations including focus on mostly patients with remote (> 5 years)
history of cancer, small sample sizes, focus on only certain DMARDs, and/or limited information on cancer-
specific mortality and other outcomes that might matter to patients. Also, nothing is known about the
perspectives and experiences of patients with RA who are being treated for a cancer and how this experience
might shape their willingness to use DMARDs. Treatment guidelines for the management of RA support a
shared decision-making (SDM) approach that attempts to leverage the professional expertise of the
rheumatologist to uphold what is most important to each patient. We herein propose a mixed methods
approach to identify the optimal ways to enhance delivery of care for these patients and to provide a foundation
for shared decision making to ensure alignment between treatment decisions and the values, goals, and
preferences of individual patients.
 The studies proposed here will build an evidence base to identify the safest DMARD options for patients
with RA who develop cancer (Aim 1); elicit the experiences, perceptions, and most valued outcomes of
patients with RA and an active or recently diagnosed (<5 years) cancer, their family members and clinicians
who care for these patients (Aim 2).
 The overall goal of this K23 mentored career development proposal is to support Dr. Namrata Singh’s
development as an independent, patient-oriented researcher whose long-term goal is to develop a research
agenda focused on the identification of factors that contribute to suboptimal treatment and outcomes for
patients with rheumatic diseases, especially those with cancer. The training and research plans proposed here
will allow her to develop critical skills in advanced pharmacoepidemiology and in qualitative research methods.
Combined with an outstanding mentorship team, the University of Washington’s world-class facilities, and a
rigorous training plan, this project will prepare Dr. Singh to successfully obtain future funding to adapt and test
a decision aid for SDM implementation among patients with RA and an active or recent cancer."
10898085,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Improving the management of acute pain, psychological distress, and other surgical outcomes among women
undergoing surgery for suspected gynecologic malignancies would proactively reach a population vulnerable to
developing chronic pain. Non-pharmacological interventions that address multiple biobehavioral dimensions of
pain (e.g., cognitive, behavioral) may be most effective at preventing the transition to chronic pain. Yoga
(meditation, movements, and breathing) is a mind-body intervention that reduces pain, psychological distress,
and sleep disturbances, and improves physical function. Yoga has a potential advantage over other
perioperative non-pharmacological interventions because of additional components that also support multiple
goals of postoperative usual care (e.g., early postoperative mobilization, encouraging deep breathing) and
could help improve other surgical management outcomes (e.g., functional recovery, length of stay). Thus, yoga
may optimally improve pain, psychological distress and other surgical management outcomes through multiple
biobehavioral mechanisms. Yet, limited rigorous research has evaluated yoga delivered in coordination with
surgical care. The proposed eHealth Mindful Movement and Breathing (eMMB) is innovative because it adapts
the core components of yoga with the intention to remove key barriers to participation and mitigate the
transition from acute to chronic pain. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of eMMB compared
to an empathic attention control (AC) among 122 women undergoing surgery for suspected gynecologic
malignancies. We aim to determine the efficacy of eMMB for improving pain and other surgical outcomes (Aim
1), and to examine the effect of eMMB on proposed proximal biobehavioral outcomes (Aim 2). We will also
conduct semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders (n=18-24; patients, champions, providers, yoga
instructors) to assess factors that serve as barriers or facilitators to sustainably implementing eMMB in clinical
care (Aim 3). Understanding these factors will inform implementation strategies to be tested in a future study.
In summary, eMMB reaches patients during the perioperative period and has the potential to prevent the
transition from acute to chronic pain with a low-cost intervention. The brevity and accessibility of the
intervention, and the increasing popularity of yoga, make eMMB a strong candidate for future implementation.
Results from this study in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignancies may be generalizable to
other surgical procedures and thus have important public health implications for reducing the growing
population affected by chronic pain. The proposed research is aligned with the scientific opportunity for
mitigating long-term effects of cancer treatment highlighted by the National Cancer Institute."
10889806,"SUMMARY
Despite the availability of targeted therapies for estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancers, which comprise
over 70% of breast cancers, most breast cancer-related deaths are attributed to recurrent ER+ breast cancer.
Thus, there is an unmet need to identify novel targets for treating ER+ patients with metastasis. We have found
that levels of Semaphorin 7a (SEMA7A) mRNA, which encodes for a membrane linked protein that can also be
shed from the cell, are associated with decreased overall survival (OS) in ER+ breast cancer patients.
Furthermore, ER+ patients treated with Tamoxifen exhibit shortened OS if their tumors are SEMA7A high,
suggesting that SEMA7A may drive resistance to endocrine therapy resulting in tumor progression and
metastasis. We have preliminary data to suggest that SEMA7A overexpression promotes resistance to endocrine
therapies via activation of cell survival pathways in breast tumor cells. Additionally, we have shown that ER
mediated transcription drives SEMA7A expression and that SEMA7A expressing cells are resistant to ER- and
CDK4/6-targeted therapies, yet sensitive to inhibition of survival pathways. We have also discovered that
decreasing expression of Singleminded-2s (SIM2s), a transcriptional repressor with known tumor suppressive
activities, also results in activation of pro-survival signaling, as well as epithelial to mesenchymal transition
(EMT), and resistance to ER-targeted therapy. Together, our preliminary data suggest that SIM2s binds to the
SEMA7A promoter and represses SEMA7A transcription. We have also identified that ER+ breast cancers in
women diagnosed within 10 years ofa pregnancy are enriched for the highly-proliferative ER+ luminal B subtype,
frequently progress to metastatic disease while on endocrine therapy, and that SEMA7A can predict for relapse
in this patient population. Thus, we propose that SIM2s mediated repression of SEMA7A may be lost in these
postpartum breast cancers (PPBCs). PPBCs also exhibit increased expression of SEMA7A and in programmed
cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and are sensitive to PD-L1 targeting in pre-clinical studies. Additionally, in TCGA
SEMA7A expressingtumors are enriched for makers of immunosuppression including PD-L1, PD-1 and FOXP3.
Based on these new results, we propose the hypothesis that a SIM2s/SEMA7A switch mediates ER+ breast
cancer progression and metastasis by conferring mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to therapy, EMT and
immunosuppression in the TME. To address this hypothesis, we propose three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will
determine the SIM2s/SEMA7A switch in therapeutic resistance and progression in ER+ breast cancer. In Aim 2,
we will definethe role of the SIM2/SEMA7A switch in altering immune suppression via PD-L1 to promote breast
cancer progression. In Aim 3 we will analyze the relationship between SIM2s and SEMA7A in women with ER+
breast cancer as predictive factors for metastatic recurrence and resistance to standard therapy. We expect that
dissecting the roles of SIM2s and SEMA7A in breast cancer will aide in developing novel therapeutic strategies."
10798106,"While opioid use has been a necessary focus of recent national attention, general US rates of alcohol use, binge drinking, and alcohol-related deaths are rising including among adolescents, with some of the highest disparities for Native Americans. Alcohol has long been a tool of colonizers to oppress Native people and purposefully inflict harm. Substance use is being further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, felt more acutely for disadvantaged communities. While there are some promising, evidence-based interventions to address substance use problems, rigorous research on these interventions in Native communities is lacking. Recognizing the prevalence of binge substance use within their community and making novel use of tribal sovereignty, the White Mountain Apache Tribe mandated reporting of binge alcohol use to their suicide and self-harm surveillance system and conducted a series of research studies. Bright Horizons is a promising, culturally adapted intervention that was subsequently developed in the final phase of a previous NARCH grant based on some of this initial research but has not been evaluated. Bright Horizons is a brief intervention that includes cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI) to reduce alcohol and other substance use and connect individuals with treatment. Our study aims are to: 1) to use a qualitative positive deviance approach to identify strengths and skills of at-risk youth (12-17 years old: N=30) who do not use substances to understand unique factors that may be relevant for a substance use prevention intervention; 2) to adapt Bright Horizons, based on Aim 1 findings, the current literature, and CAB input for piloting by Apache community mental health specialists (CMHS) with N=10 Apache youth with recent serious binge alcohol use; and 3) to test the effectiveness of Bright Horizons using a randomized controlled trial with Apache adolescents (N=100) with recent serious binge alcohol use. This study is innovative and will add to the literature by: a) designing an intervention grounded in our own theoretical model informed by local data and other Indigenous frameworks; b) implementing a brief intervention that while focused on alcohol, also recognizes that adolescents, are engaged in polysubstance use and have changing substance use patterns, and c) use of CMHS which serves as a model for transforming mental health care, the necessity of which has become even more pronounced and evident during the COVID-19 crisis. This grant is locally led by two Apache Co-Investigators with their Master's degrees, enrolled in part-time doctoral programs in mental health, and supports an additional 4 Apache team members who will receive training in substance use intervention and research."
10892098,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Substance use disorder (SUD) remains a large problem in the United States. The primary goal of the CARRS
Center is to understand how sleep and circadian rhythm traits and environmental disruptions during adolescence
lead to increased vulnerability for substance abuse. We predict that a combination of biological and
environmental factors contribute to this increased risk. The goal of Project 3 in the Center is to provide
translational studies in both human subjects and rodent models that determine mechanistic details of how
circadian rhythm and sleep disruption alter reward circuitry. We will also test potential therapeutic treatments for
social jet lag in adolescents that might mitigate risk for SUD. Here we will use a noninvasive method of assessing
the human molecular clock using skin cells collected from hair follicles, which has been fully optimized for the
measure of molecular rhythms. However, no study to date has cultured cells from adolescents for molecular
rhythm measurement, associated molecular rhythms with other sleep, reward and circadian measures, or
investigated the effects of potentially therapeutic compounds on these rhythms. In Project 3 we will be utilizing
hair follicle samples collected in P1/2 from human subjects and combine this data with the thorough rhythm,
sleep, cognition, and reward data collected in those projects. We will also determine how molecular measures
in rodents correlate with behavioral and electrophysiological data collected in P4/5. Moreover, we are testing
potential pharmacological interventions on molecular rhythms which will inform future clinical trials. We are also
using rodents to provide detailed gene and protein expression in brain regions of interest in response to specific
manipulations of sleep and circadian rhythms. The questions we want to answer are: (1) How are sleep and
circadian rhythm phenotypes and addiction vulnerability related to molecular rhythms? This will be tested in both
humans and rats through cell culture studies. (2) What are the molecular mechanisms by which circadian rhythm
and sleep disruptions in combination or independently lead to increased vulnerability for substance abuse in
adolescents? This will be tested in rodents generated in Core B that have experienced specific sleep and
circadian manipulations followed by RNA sequencing and proteomics in PFC and NAc. (3) Are there
pharmacological interventions that will shift and/or amplify molecular rhythms in human subjects that could be
useful for adolescents with delayed chronotypes and circadian misalignment? This will be directly tested in cell
culture. Taken together, these studies could point towards novel treatments for adolescents that are at risk for
substance use disorders."
10892099,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescence is a period of enhanced vulnerability to develop substance use disorders in part do to the ongoing
development of neural circuits associated with reward and executive function (i.e., impulsivity, attention, reward
sensitivity). In addition, adolescents experience a developmentally regulated shift in circadian rhythms to a more
evening chronotype and have less perceived sleep drive. Thus, adolescents are biologically driven to stay up
later at night and wake later in the morning. However, this natural shift in circadian rhythms is in conflict with
societal norms, particularly early school start times, which can lead to a chronic state of circadian misalignment
and insufficient sleep. The degree to which chronic circadian and sleep disturbances in adolescence impacts
brain development and risk for drug abuse is not well understood. Moreover, there is a wide variation in the
degree of circadian shift amongst adolescents, leading to the possibility that certain individuals are more at risk
than others for circadian and sleep-associated dysfunction. Therefore, an increased understanding of the
behavioral and neural consequences of sleep and circadian disturbances, and their interaction with individual
differences in sleep and circadian preferences, is needed to inform new interventions and preventative
strategies. Project 4 of the Center for Adolescent Reward, Rhythms, and Sleep (CARRS) aims to determine
the effects individual differences in chronotype (Aim 1), circadian misalignment in the absence of sleep loss (Aim
2), and acute and chronic sleep disruption (Aim 3) on behavioral indices of addiction risk and corticolimbic neural
activity in adolescent rats. Identification of individual differences in sleep and circadian preferences will be
facilitated by using the heterogeneous stock (HS) outbred rats that produce more variability than standard
outbred strains, and allow for precise genetic identification of trait differences. Rats will be phenotyped for
circadian and sleep preferences in early adolescence by our Phenotyping and Bio-banking Core B. We will
then examine how these phenotypes related to impulsivity and execute function on the 5-choice serial reaction
time task (5-CSRTT) and if rats with extreme chronotypes (early vs. late) exhibit differences in nicotine or THC
self-administration. Aims 2 and 3 will focus on how manipulations of circadian rhythms and sleep alter behavior
on the 5-CSRTT and drug self-administration. In addition, we will test how corticolimbic activity is altered by
circadian and sleep manipulations during behavior using in vivo fiber photometry. Results of these studies will
be integrated with human neuroimaging data obtained in Projects 1 and 2, and with the molecular and ex vivo
electrophysiological results obtained in Projects 3 and 5."

application  is  that adolescent development acts  on underlying  sleep and circadian  traits  to  modify homeostatic 
sleep  drive,  circadian  phase,  and  circadian  alignment,  which  in  turn  impact  cortico-­limbic  functions  critical  to

alter reward processing. Specifically, the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a reward-­processing “hub” in the ventral 
striatum which is sensitive to both sleep and circadian disruptions. For example, acute sleep deprivation reduces 
glutamate release at medial prefrontal cortex-­to-­NAc medium spiny principal neurons (MSNs) synapses;; chronic 
sleep  fragmentation  increases  cholinergic  neural  activity  in  the  NAc  (preliminary  results);;  robust  diurnal 
fluctuations in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) levels and intrinsic membrane excitability are also observed in the NAc 
MSNs, and circadian gene mutation in the NAc leads to altered AMPAR transmission in MSNs. Together, these 
results suggest that the NAc may represent a converging site for sleep and circadian rhythm to regulate reward 
processing. Accordingly, Project 5 will test the hypothesis that sleep and circadian rhythm target aspects of NAc 
synaptic  transmission  and  neural  modulation  to  regulate  reward-­motivated  behaviors.  Thus,  Aim  1  will  use 
genetically  diverse  outbred  rats  to  determine  whether  naturally  occurring  “early”  and  “late”  chronotypes  are 
associated  with  different  diurnal  variation of  AMPAR  transmission  in  NAc  MSNs.  This  aim  will  accommodate 
molecular  (Project 3) and  behavioral  (Project  4) characterizations  of  these  rats.  Aim 2  will  determine  whether 
circadian  disruptions  without  changes  in  sleep  alter  the  diurnal  variation  of  membrane  excitability  and/or

inherited forms of DCM. The pathway emerged from an unbiased, high-throughput functional genomics screen
to discover novel therapeutic targets and signaling pathways capable of restoring contractile function in human
induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) harboring DCM-causing mutations. The screen and
subsequent validation experiments revealed that activation of the AMPK-BACH1-NRF2 pathway restored
contractility of multiple patients’ hiPSC-CMs carrying the DCM-causing TNNT2 R173W mutation. The magnitude
of the effect was comparable to CRISPR-mediated correction of the mutation. Importantly, activation of the
pathway had no effect on healthy (isogenic control) hiPSC-CMs, suggesting that the therapeutic response is
specific for the disease context.
Modulation of AMPK, BACH1 and NRF2 have been reported to elicit protective effects in ischemic heart disease
models but these targets are largely unexplored in the context of inherited DCM. The proposed Specific Aims
address critical issues necessary to advance targeting this pathway to treat inherited DCM. AIM 1 explores the
selectivity of pathway activation for restoring contractile function in different forms of inherited DCM, including
disease caused by mutations in myofilament (TNNT2, MYH7 and TTN) and non-myofilament (PLN, RBM20,
LMNA) genes. We expect that the pathway will ameliorate contractile dysfunction in multiple forms of DCM. AIM
2 will define the mechanism(s) of action by identifying specific genes downstream of pathway activation that are
essential to restore contractile function. Our hypothesis is that the pathway converges on a subset of NRF2-
target genes. AIM 3 explores whether activating the pathway restores contractile function by normalizing
metabolic and/or ER/SR stress. Finally, AIM 4 tests whether activating the pathway will mitigate clinical features
of DCM using an established mouse model.
A successful outcome of this project will constitute a mechanism-based approach to treat inherited DCM. The
project uses both human patient iPSC models and mouse transgenic models to integrate human cellular context
with whole organism physiology. The outcome will define mechanism(s) of action that might not only benefit
inherited DCM but also inform the development of novel strategies to treat acquired forms of DCM."

 The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as of June 14, 2021, has totaled 176.02 million
cases, 3.80 million deaths, and 2.37 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally. However, many
have suffered prior to the vaccine and have survived or will still suffer without the vaccine. Therefore,
determining the possible long-term health ramifications post-infection, how they vary based on age at the time
of infection, and whether disease severity differentially impacts long-term health is imperative. Information on
how COVID-19 affects bone metabolism and homeostasis is limited. This is of crucial concern because the
aging population generally has higher bone loss and are at the highest risk of developing severe COVID-19
infection. The objective of the current application is to determine whether long-term deficits in bone mass
are experienced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The long-term goal is to develop potential treatment
strategies to combat COVID-19 related bone loss. Preliminary studies showed that in a K18-hACE2 mouse
model of COVID-19, surviving mice infected with 1x103 or 1x104 PFU exhibited up to a 24% reduction in
trabecular bone volume fraction just 2 weeks post infection (p<0.001). Infected mice had a 63% increase in
osteoclast numbers (p<0.0002) and a 30% increase in surface occupied by osteoclasts (p<0.02) compared to
non-infected controls. Additionally, mice infected with any dose of SARS-CoV-2 had a 40% increase in
megakaryocytes (MKs) within their femoral bone marrow compared to that observed in mock-infected controls
(p<0.008). Further, previously conducted studies showed that MKs regulate bone mass and osteoclast (OC)
formation (aged MKs increase OCs and have increased RANKL expression). Moreover, patients with severe
forms of COVID-19 have upregulated expression of numerous cytokines and growth factors which is known as
an inflammatory cytokine storm. Many of these cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-α, are known to regulate
OCs and/or MKs and may be responsible for the bone loss observed in the preliminary studies. Based on
these observations it is hypothesized that i) SARS-CoV-2 infection results in long-term health complications in
the musculoskeletal system, and ii) SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated cytokine storm increases MK-
stimulated OC formation. To test this hypothesis, two specific aims will be pursued: 1- determine whether
following SARS-CoV-2 infection the bone loss observed remains over time and whether age at the time of
infection impacts the severity of bone loss induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and: 2- investigate the
mechanisms by which OC formation and bone resorption are increased as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2
infection and age, including the extent to which MKs from infected mice induce OC formation and bone
resorption. The successful completion of these studies will deepen the understanding of the health implications
post-infection with SARS-COV-2 and will demonstrate how disease severity, age, and MKs influence skeletal
homeostasis as well as OC formation and resorption."
10891660,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly 60% of youths in the U.S. are exposed to childhood adversity, including violence exposure, abuse,
neglect, loss of caregivers, and living in poverty. Global and national data indicate that adversity accounts for
30-50% of the risk for depression onset from childhood through adolescence, and response to evidence-based
front-line interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] and antidepressants) is notably poor among
adversity-exposed youths. Research demonstrates that exposure to adversity disrupts general learning
processes, including higher-order cognitive processes (i.e., cognitive control). Learning impairments may impede
one of the most common and critical intermediary treatment processes across evidence-based psychotherapies:
the acquisition of therapy skills. This proposal uses an innovative approach to investigate childhood adversity
exposure as a predictor of skill acquisition for the most commonly implemented CBT skill with depressed youths,
cognitive restructuring. To refine interventions and optimize effectiveness, it is critical to identify how existing
treatments break down. This study will use a repeated-measures, multiple levels of analysis approach to assess
acquisition and retention of an experimenter-introduced cognitive restructuring skill, among depressed
adolescents with population-level variability in lifetime adversity exposure (n=90). The candidate proposes to
investigate associations between adversity exposure and learning-related cognitive control processes in the
context of adolescent depression (Aim 1). Adversity exposure and cognitive control will be examined as direct
predictors of CBT skill acquisition and skill retention over six-months; an indirect pathway from adversity to skill
acquisition through cognitive control will also be examined (Aim 2). The candidate will further explore key
characteristics of adversity, namely the type (threat of harm versus deprivation of resources) and developmental
timing of exposure, as distinct predictors of skill acquisition (exploratory Aim 3). The proposed K23 builds on the
candidate’s prior training in environmental and biobehavioral risk for psychopathology, and evaluation of
treatment effectiveness, with new training in 1) experimental therapeutics; 2) developmental conceptualizations
of childhood adversity, and 3) behavioral assessments of cognitive and affective learning processes. The
Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh is an ideal scientific setting to achieve the proposed
career development goals, and the candidate will receive training from a team of mentors (Drs. Goldstein, Luby,
and Sheridan) and consultants (Drs. Forbes, Lindhiem, and Wallace) with expertise in target-focused intervention
research, child adversity and risk for poor clinical course in youth depression, and developmental cognitive and
affective science. The near-term goal of this award is to identify sensitive markers of depression intervention
response among adversity-exposed youths. This will provide a crucial vehicle to advance the candidate’s
overarching career objective: to develop a translational research program leveraging advances in basic science
to inform experimental therapeutics for personalizing and optimizing depression treatment in high-risk youths."

Validating highly sensitive molecular analysis approaches that can fully exploit precious clinical specimens will
transform cancer research and clinical applications. Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for cancer diagnosis
and has been the primary source of clinical biospecimens in cancer research. However, one of the biggest
challenges in basic and clinical cancer research is the frequent lack of sufficient amount of tumor materials
from biopsy for multi-omics research (e.g., parallel RNA and DNA-based profiling) after diagnostic procedures,
thus limiting progress in systems biology. As such, the ability to conveniently sample bodily fluids, including
circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma, offers great promise for enabling highly-sensitive, minimally-
invasive, cost-efficient cancer diagnostic methods, and facilitating screening of high-risk populations and
patient monitoring. However, cfDNA typically exists in extremely low quantity (e.g., a few nanograms from
several mL of blood). Cancer-derived cfDNA is expected to constitute an even smaller portion of the already
scarce cfDNA. To accelerate and enhance cancer biology and clinical applications, this R33 aims to validate a
novel technology for profiling DNA methylation, i.e., 5-methylcytosines (5mC), which contributes to cancer
pathobiology, is reflected in patient-derived cfDNA, and has been integrated in several FDA-approved tests.
Given the prevalence of 5mC in the human genome, its roles in gene regulation, and high chemical stability,
validating a novel 5mC technology in nanogram or sub-nanogram-level DNA materials offers promising
opportunities for various applications in cancer research that have been limited by technology that can utilize
limited clinical samples. Specifically, we developed the T7-Linear Amplification based Bisulfite Sequencing
(LABS-seq) that integrates a specially-designed bisulfite conversion procedure with the next-generation
sequencing (NGS) for sensitively and unbiasedly detecting 5mC in nanogram or sub-nanogram-level DNA
materials (e.g., 100 pg). Our preliminary results demonstrated the technical robustness of the LABS-seq and
the feasibility of using this innovative technology to identify cancer-specific 5mC changes in cfDNA. In this R33,
we will rigorously validate the LABS-seq technique using banked tumor tissues/cells and plasma cfDNA
samples from 250 patients with diverse cancer types and 50 frequency-matched healthy controls as well as
longitudinal samples from 200 prospectively recruited cancer patients. In Aim 1, we will validate the LABS-seq
in genomic DNA (gDNA) from tumor tissues/cells to detect cancer type-specific epigenetic alterations. In Aim 2,
we will validate the LABS-seq in cfDNA for the detection of cancer and longitudinal changes. Upon completion
of this project, we will provide a highly sensitive, cost-efficient, transformative epigenetic approach applicable
to both gDNA and cfDNA, opening up opportunities for research that have been limited by technology. Our
established multidisciplinary team, well-annotated human clinical specimens, and excellent environment will
ensure the success of this proposed project and future implementation in the clinic."
10891663,"The field of neuroscience and the BRAIN Initiative in particular are amassing a wealth of informatics resources for managing, analyzing, and sharing data. Yet every lab must solve similar sets of problems to integrate these tools into the particular workflows of their experiments: data entry, acquisition, processing, analysis, and vi­sualization. We created DataJoint: an open-source general framework for experiment data pipelines and col­laborative automated workflows . Either independently or with support from our company, dozens of research groups have adopted DataJoint for diverse data modalities such as multielectrode electrophysiology, calcium imaging, light and electron microscopy, behavior tracking, sensory stimulation, transcriptomics, and optoge­netics. In these complex data ecosystems, DataJoint enables groups of scientists to collaborate with clear work­ flows while sharing data continuously and conserving data integrity.
To disseminate and integrate shared data pipelines into neuroscience practice, we propose to compile and dis­seminate a library of DataJoint Pipelines for Neurophysiology. We will extract essential motifs from DataJoint­ based open projects and organize them by data modality into a collection of curated, mutually-compatible modules stringing together data collection and computation. Documented and ready for de novo deployment, the modules will feature ancillary tools for data entry (electronic lab books), interactive graphical user inter­ faces adapted from existing projects (e.g. customizable data processing steps integrating popular algorithms for image segmentation and spike sorting), and integration of existing brain atlases, coordinate frameworks, ontologies for cell classification , and nomenclatures for viruses and transgenic lines. To foster uniform ontolo­gies, we will harmonize these pipelines with emerging neurodata standards. The results of this work will be administered as an online resource showcasing the pipelines along with sample data, executable demos, and guidelines for deployment. Visitors will be able to customize, extend, and combine the modules into complete pipelines suitable for their particular experiments and learn the techniques for building new solutions. The modules will support diverse computing architectures, including specialized hardware and cloud services. We will also conduct web-based trainings and in-person hackathons to help accelerate the adoption of these tools in working neuroscience labs. Vathes LLC is uniquely positioned to perform this work as we co-develop data pipelines for collaborative projects such as IARPA's MICrONS, International Brain Lab, and BRAIN Initiative Ul9 pro jects. The output of this project will enable many new research groups to adopt DataJoint and to effectively integrate informatics tools into neuroscience practice."
10891609,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The gastrointestinal tract is home to trillions of microorganisms that play an essential role in early life
development and the maintenance of health. Shortly after birth, newborns are rapidly colonized by this
complex microbial community that possesses a rich metabolic potential. Perturbation to assembly of the
microbiota can have major downstream consequences to health. However, the fundamental ecological
principles and molecular processes that underlie establishment of a beneficial and stable microbial community
are largely unknown. Defining the multidimensional interactions in this complex ecosystem has proven
incredibly challenging and has not moved far beyond simple associations. This is in part due to the inherent
complexity and interconnectedness of the microbiota and a lack of fundamental mechanistic studies at this
interface. Moreover, there are limited technologies available to spatially map and study metabolic cross talk
between species in the microbiota. Here, we propose a novel strategy to generate a molecular blueprint of the
metabolic interactions in the assembling microbiota using an innovative pipeline that integrates advanced
imaging metabolomics with comprehensive mechanistic studies. Our objective is to generate a high-resolution
spatial map of metabolites during community assembly and perturbation. We will use this molecular map to
systematically determine the mechanisms of metabolic cross talk between members of the microbiota and
define the role of these interactions in assembly of communities. We will study colonization and deconstruct
mechanisms of community assembly using simple synesthetic microbial communities, gnotobiotics, and
continuous flow cultivar systems. Our goal is to provide a detailed understanding of the spatial localization and
molecular mechanisms of metabolic interactions in the microbiota during early life. Furthermore, we will define
the molecular determinants that confer increased fitness for early life colonizing organisms. Together, this
proposal will provide a framework for understanding the fundamental mechanisms of community assembly in
infants and lead to the development of novel strategies for manipulating microbial communities in early life and
during microbiota-associated disease."
10891612,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) ranks as the second most common blood cancer and it remains incurable. Autologous
stem cell transplantation (ASCT) remains a mainstay of therapy for eligible patients. Despite the routine use of
novel agents as post-ASCT “maintenance” to delay or prevent relapse, most patients will succumb after
transplant. There is considerable body of evidence to suggest that immunoregulatory mechanisms established
in post-ASCT bone marrow (BM) microenvironment favor relapse and constitute attractive therapeutic targets.
Post-ASCT relapses depend on tolerogenic IL10-producing myeloid cells (dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages,
collectively referred to as tol-DC) and IL17 proposed to act on MM cells in a cell-autonomous manner. However,
the upstream signals or microenvironmental triggers that elicit these processes are unclear.
Tol-DC polarization and Th17 differentiation are promoted through Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 signaling. We
previously reported that MM-accessory cells secrete the TLR2-ligand matrix proteoglycan, versican (VCAN).
VCAN promotes tol-DC polarization in carcinomas and therefore, it constitutes a prime suspect for triggering
relapse-promoting, TLR2-dependent processes in MM.
In the MM microenvironment, specifically post-ASCT, VCAN undergoes ADAMTS-mediated extracellular
proteolysis to release an N-terminal fragment, versikine. Versikine acts as a matrikine (an extracellular matrix-
derived fragment that regulates cell activity, often in a manner distinct from that of its parent macromolecule).
Versikine is a weak IL6/IL10 trigger, therefore it is unlikely to be a potent tol-DC/Th17 inducer. Instead, versikine
stimulates IRF8-dependent transcripts and promotes the IRF8-dependent Batf3-DC subset in vitro and in vivo.
We hypothesize that the versikine-IRF8-Batf3-DC axis may engage the potent (and perhaps dominant)
tolerogenic VCAN-TLR2 pathway in a dynamic crosstalk.
We have delineated 2 specific Aims to investigate the mechanisms by which VCAN and versikine regulate anti-
MM immunity post-ASCT: In Aim 1, we shall dissect VCAN-TLR2 signaling in anti-MM immunity and design
novel post-ASCT treatment strategies based on targeting tolerogenic VCAN-TLR2 signaling. In Aim 2, we shall
study in-depth the role of the matrikine, versikine, in anti-MM immunity.
Success of our Aims will optimize MM treatment (maintenance) strategies to prolong post-ASCT survival. The
experiments proposed here are facilitated by our recent generation of the first Ras-driven MM model, VQ. RAS
pathway is the most commonly mutated pathway in human MM. In contrast to current state-of-art MM models,
VQ is readily transducible by lentiviral vectors and engrafts in C57BL/6J recipients (facilitating mechanistic in
vivo studies). Several of the studies proposed here have been impossible or impractical using existing MM
models."
10891613,"Pregestational diabetes induces neural tube defects (NTDs) in the offspring. Even under the best preconception care, women having diabetes are still three- to four-times more likely to have a child with a birth defect than women without diabetes. Mechanistic studies provide important insights for the development of novel prevention strategies. Studies using diabetic embryopathy have revealed the critical involvement of epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of NTDs. RNA modifications are involved in important biological processes including development. We observed epitranscriptomic changes in neurulation stage embryos exposed to maternal diabetes. Maternal diabetes decreased the expression of the m6A RNA methylation writer’s methyltransferase- like 3 (METTL3) and METTL14 and altered planar cell polarity. Therefore, we hypothesize that maternal diabetes reduces m6A RNA methylation levels by repressing METTL3 and METTL14 expression through oxidative stress responsive kinase signaling in neurulation stage embryos leading to NTDs, and that restoring METTL3 and METTL14 expression in the developing neuroepithelium ameliorates diabetic embryopathy, whereas deleting either one enhances diabetes induced NTDs. Diabetes-induced RNA hypomethylation alters RNA expression encoding the planar cell polarity (PCP) components resulting in neuroepithelial cell polarity defects and cellular dysfunction. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism underlying maternal diabetes reduced METTL3 and METTL14 expression in the developing embryo. We will examine that two transcription factors c-Jun and FOxO3a, which are downstream of the oxidative stress- activated kinase signaling, act in concert in response to maternal diabetes to suppress METTL3 and METTL14 expression in the developing embryos leading to the reduction of m6A RNA methylation in the neuroepithelium. Aim 2 will investigate the critical role of reduced METTL3 and METTL14 expression in the induction of diabetic embryopathy. Our working hypothesis is that restoring either METLL3 or METTL14 in the developing neuroepithelium rescues m6A RNA methylation and ameliorates diabetic embryopathy. Aim 3 will determine whether reduced m6A RNA methylation dysregulates PCP gene expression leading to neuroepithelial cell polarity defects in diabetic embryopathy. We will determine whether maternal diabetes-induced RNA hypomethylation dysregulates PCP mRNA expression leading to disruption of neuroepithelial cell polarity. We will examine whether maternal diabetes increases Fzd5 expression through repressing METLL3 or METTL14."
10891614,"Covid-19 exposed inequitable healthcare access and disparate health outcomes of people of color, that are
due to structural racism and discrimination (SRD)—but in an unprecedented turn, policymakers also deployed
a major novel tool to address SRD within, and likely outside of the pandemic. Rapidly and widely adopting a
proposal by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine's (NASEM), a majority of US states
(n=34) addressed SRD by including disadvantage indices (DIs) in vaccine allocation plans. DIs are place-
based statistical measures of deprivation or vulnerability that integrate Census data such as income, education
or quality of housing, to rank geographic areas as small as neighborhoods. Because one of the consequences
of SRD is that people of color face reduced economic and housing opportunities and account for larger shares
of disadvantaged communities, DIs simultaneously capture SRD impact, and offer tools for mitigation. For
example, under severe scarcity, DIs were used to increase vaccine shares for disadvantaged areas, and, by
extension, more people of color. DIs hence mitigated the risk that traditional allocation frameworks result in
SRD, even if unintended. Still, the rapid adoption and wide rangeof uses leave unclear what the optimal uses
of DIs are within and outside of health emergencies. Our goal is to determine the strengths and weaknesses of
DIs in addressing SRD in Covid-19, future pandemics, public health and clinical care.

The aim of this project is to support an IND application for GTC-3295 for the treatment of
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Neurodegenerative amyloid diseases such as AD have common
underlying biochemical pathways leading to oligomerization and aggregation of amyloidogenic
peptides and prion-like spreading of amyloid proteopathic seeds throughout the Central Nervous
System (CNS). Recent data suggest that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HS-GAGs) are
the receptors responsible for internalization and spreading of amyloid-beta (Abeta) and tau
neuropathologies in the brain. We are developing a novel class of therapeutics,
Glycosaminoglycan-Interacting Small Molecules (GISMOs), for the treatment of AD. GISMOs
are drug-like small molecule compounds that inhibit Abeta and tau interactions with HS-GAGs,
each of which is a key molecule implicated in AD pathogenesis, and may reduce propagation of
these aggregated proteins in the Alzheimer's brain. GTC-3295 is a New Chemical Entity (NCE)
and has dual activity as it efficiently inhibits both Abeta as well as Tau interactions with HS-
GAGs. In previous studies in a transgenic mouse model of AD, GTC-3295 decreased amyloid
burden in the mouse brain by as much as five-fold, and significantly decreased
hyperphosphorylated tau levels in CA1 region of hippocampus. Initial preclinical studies indicate
that GTC-3295 is an orally available and brain penetrant compound possessing favorable
properties in in vitro ADME, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and other studies. These results provide
justification to continue developing GTC-3295. In this SBIR project, we will perform a number of
IND-enabling preclinical studies including GLP Toxicology studies in two species, scale-up
synthesis, formulation studies, and development of bioanalytical methods. We will also evaluate
efficacy of GTC-3295 in two transgenic models of AD, that separately address Abeta and tau
neuropathologies. Completion of these requisite development activities should position this
project towards a successful IND submission to the FDA and advancing into Phase I clinical
trials in humans."

Objective: Develop two innovative high-speed 3D breast photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT)
systems to diagnose benign, atypical, and malignant lesions — leading to a more streamlined and accurate
workup that reduces unnecessary follow-up imaging and benign breast biopsies.
Clinical significance: Abnormal findings detected by screening mammography lead to workups including
additional imaging, usually in the form of extra mammogram views, tomosynthesis, and/or ultrasound, and
possibility of breast biopsy. Biopsies have considerable side effects such as pain and bleeding, and are
unnecessary in the majority (60 – 70%) of cases because of the high false-positive rate of mammography. The
side effects, costs, and delays of the workups cause considerable stress to patients. PACT combines the
functional optical contrast of diffuse optical tomography and the high spatial resolution of ultrasonography
without speckle artifacts. The attenuation coefficient of near-IR light in breast tissue is only twice that of
mammographic x-ray—enabling adequate optical penetration, but light has far higher soft-tissue contrast than
x-ray. With rich functional contrast at high spatial and temporal resolutions and without using ionizing radiation
or exogenous contrast agents, 3D breast PACT has the potential to reduce unnecessary benign breast
biopsies by serving as a diagnostic tool adjunct to mammography. Possible long-term breast imaging
applications include not only diagnosis, but also screening, assessment of response to pre-operative systemic
therapy, and definitive surgical planning.
Challenges: Numerous innovations are required to develop a PACT imaging system effective for clinical
breast imaging. Previous PACT breast imagers possess significant limitations, including suboptimal light
delivery, limited detection view, non-isotropic spatial resolution, and long scanning times. There remains an
imperative need for more advanced PACT breast imaging technologies.
Solutions: Encouraged by the preliminary deep and clear in vivo breast images acquired by our newly
developed PACT system, we propose further innovations for 3D functional breast imaging to overcome the
above-mentioned limitations. Aim 1: To develop a single-breath-hold 3D breast imaging system with nearly
isotropic 3D resolutions and dual-wavelength contrasts (Model I). Aim 2: To develop a snapshot 3D breast
PACT system (Model II) using the concept of acoustic ergodicity. It can reach the ultimate imaging speed
(single laser shot), desirable for 3D high-resolution functional and dynamic imaging without motion artifacts.
Both systems can perform elastography. Contrasts to be imaged include vascularity, concentration and oxygen
saturation of hemoglobin, elasticity, and tumor volume and shape. Aim 3: To test PACT for the diagnosis of
benign, atypical, and malignant breast lesions by comparing with the gold standard of tissue pathology."
10891672,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 A major unresolved question in neurodegenerative disease is the mechanisms that drive selective cell
vulnerability. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are glycoproteins that promote oligomerization of amyloid-
β and prions in vitro and slow the clearance of amyloid-β in the brain of an Alzheimer’s disease mouse model.
HSPGs interact with misfolded proteins through their HS chains and promote their internalization in immortalized
neural cells. This protein aggregate uptake is profoundly impacted by the HS length and level of sulfation which,
importantly, broadly differ between cell types. We and others have used highly sulfated HS-like glycopolymers
to test the crucial role of HS in the interaction and in vitro replication of prions. However, the composition of
endogenous HS and their specific roles in healthy aged and disease-affected brain are unknown. I found that
mice expressing shorter HS chains showed prolonged survival and profoundly altered prion plaque distribution
in brain when infected with a plaque-forming prion strain, but did not show any change in the prion disease
phenotype caused by aggregate-forming prions. Here I will define the HS molecules that bind to physiological
and misfolded prion protein in different neuronal populations. I hypothesize that the interaction of HS with
misfolded prions is a major determinant underlying the selective cell vulnerability in prion disease. In
Aim 1, I will determine the role of HS sulfation in the prion replication i) in vitro, using HS isolated from distinct
neuronal populations, and ii) in vivo, by mouse models deficient in HS sulfation. I will measure how the variation
in the HS sulfation impacts the PrP cell tropism and lesion targets in the brain, and how age affects HS
composition. I will next manipulate the HS composition in different neuronal populations i) to measure the
selective cell uptake of prions strains and their degree of dependence on HS (Aim 2), and ii) to test a new strategy
to block prion progression based on using HSPG mimetics as vehicles to promote prion degradation in
lysosomes (Aim 3). I expect to define the molecular mechanisms underlying selective cell vulnerability in prion
disease and to discover new targets for the rational design of neuroprotective therapies for patients with prion
disease. Due to the many commonalities between the pathogenesis of prion disease and Alzheimer’s disease, I
plan to ultimately extend my research strategy to the study of cell targeting by amyloid-β. This K99/R00
application is an ideal pathway to independence that is supported by an outstanding group of mentors and
advisors, extensive training in highly innovative techniques, a world-class scientific environment, and clear
departmental commitment."
10872262,"The axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier are sites of action potential generation and regeneration,
respectively and are thus critical for the proper function of the nervous system. Their key roles in electrogenesis
results from the striking enrichment of a macromolecular complex of voltage-gated sodium (NaV) and potassium
(KCNQ) channels, cell adhesion molecules (NF186, NrCAM), and a cytoskeletal scaffold of ankyrin G (AnkG)
and beta-IV (βIV) spectrin. Prior to myelination, nodal components are diffusely distributed along axons
consistent with their continuous conduction of action potentials. With myelination, the axon reorganizes into
discrete domains, culminating in node assembly, thus enabling saltatory conduction. A key question is what
drives this reorganization? We have found two complementary mechanisms broadly contribute: i) recruitment
signals that target and stabilize this complex at nodes and ii) active clearance that removes nodal proteins from
everywhere else along the axon. Here, we examine the contribution of both mechanisms to node formation.
Recruitment signals at PNS and CNS nodes culminate in assembly of an AnkG/βIV spectrin cytoskeleton scaffold
to which all other nodal components bind. This scaffold is further tethered to and likely stabilized by regularly
spaced, sub-membranous actin rings at both the AIS and nodes. We recently reported actin rings at the AIS and
nodes are specifically modified by contractile myosin II. In particular, phosphorylated myosin light chain (pMLC)
- the regulatory subunit that activates the contractile function of myosin II - is enriched at and an early marker of
the AIS and nodes. Strategies that increase or decrease pMLC levels/myosin II activity, drive AIS assembly and
disassembly, respectively. These results implicate contractile NMII as a novel regulator of the AIS and suggest
a conserved role at nodes, a notion strongly supported by MLC knockdown studies. We have also found that
just prior to myelination, glial cells drive clearance of nodal components from the internode by clathrin-mediated
endocytosis (CME). Our results suggest cleared proteins are not linked to the cytoskeleton and can therefore be
clustered for endocytosis. In agreement expression of a mutant NF186 construct engineered to bind to the
internodal cytoskeleton, is not endocytosed but rather is persistently expressed along the axon. Strikingly, this
construct delays myelination. This latter finding suggests clearance has dual roles in sculpting the node and
preparing the axon for myelination thereby coordinating assembly of the node of Ranvier with myelination of
axons. Here, we test key aspects of this model, including the role of MLC/myosin II in node assembly/stability
and actin ring integrity by knockdown and knockout strategies. We will also examine the mechanisms and
consequences of this glia-driven clearance of axonal proteins, including modeling defective CME in mice to
broadly perturb the axon surface proteome and assess its effects on myelination. These studies will provide
important new insights into axo-glial interactions that regulate node formation and myelination and, potentially,
into pathogenetic mechanisms that contribute to disorders of myelinated fibers."
10869524,"Summary/Abstract
The brain evolved to move the body, i.e., to implement sensorimotor control. Understanding the brain, then, is
inextricably linked to understanding how it coordinates the joints and muscles of the body to generate competent
behavior in dynamic and unpredictable environments in the service of goals. A tantilizing consequence of this is
that understanding sensorimotor control will shed light on overall brain organizational and computational
principles, including, potentially, higher-level cognition, which evolved much more recently by adapting the
circuits already in place to control movement. This promise has not yet been realized, however, because
standard approaches to studying motor control seek to reduce complexity by, for example, isolating simple
circuits, studying artificial tasks, or constraining movements. These approaches thus avoid the sine qua non of
motor control in biology: multiple interacting brain regions, multiple simultaneous goals, and multiple muscle
coordinations, all in the presence of many sources of noise and sensory delays. Here, we propose to embrace
this complexity rather than reduce it and are enabled to do so through the use of 'virtual rat' models that comprise
deep neural network controllers designed to be analogous to biological brains and biomechanically accurate
bodies that are instantiated in simulators with real physics. Using a high-throughput easy-to-use ‘virtual
neuroscience’ platform that we are developing for our own use, and the use of the broader research community,
we will train these models to imitate freely-behaving real animals such that they internalize the statistics of
naturalistic behavior and then train them to solve goal-directed tasks. This novel ‘deep neuroethology’ approach
has two crucial features: highly biologically realistic behavior and the full transparency of a model. We will then
apply this approach to generate and test longstanding hypotheses about motor control and learning. For
example, we will interrogate: (i) how the learning and execution of complex behavior are influenced by certain
circuit motifs such as laterality, reciprocal inhibition between antagonistic muscle pairs, feedback architecture,
sensor delays, cortical–subcortical interactions, and dopamine-mediated plasticity; (ii) how feedforward outputs
and feedback inputs – in the setting of noise and sensory delays – coordinate movement; (iii) how animals learn
to adapt their behaviors quickly such that they can generalize across novel environments and tasks; and (iv)
what roles the distinct neural representations and circuit motifs found throughout the hierarchy of the motor
system play in neural computation. The results of these studies will drive previously unachievable refinements
to our theories of sensorimotor control and will thus spur new research directions in motor neuroscience and,
potentially, in robotics and other fields. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we will have demonstrated the
power of virtual neuroscience, inspiring future similar research programs, potentially using virtual animals of
many species, to probe the mysteries of neural computation."
10867306,"Project Summary/ Abstract
While substantial progress has been made to delineate the somatic mutations that drive myeloproliferative
neoplasms (MPNs), epidemiologic studies demonstrate a significant heritable risk for disease acquisition. We
have recently conducted the largest genome-wide association study of MPNs to define inherited risk variants
that promote the acquisition of this disease. Our initial analyses suggest a role for modulation of HSC self-
renewal and function by these inherited risk variants. However, we lack a complete mechanistic understanding
of how the selective pressures that arise from these inherited variants can promote MPN acquisition. Here, in
this R01, we specifically want to understand how inherited risk variants can provide selective pressures to enable
MPN initiation. In the first aim of this grant, we seek to use rigorous mouse models to define how a variant-
containing HSC-selective enhancer of Gfi1b can promote MPN acquisition. We will study how this enhancer
plays a role in native hematopoiesis to promote MPN initiation, as well as how this enhancer can cooperate with
somatic mutations in this process. In the second aim of this grant, we seek to understand how loss-of-function
of CHEK2 can promote MPN acquisition and clonal hematopoiesis by coupling genome editing of primary human
hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells and whole genome sequencing to assess how such germline genetic
mutations can promote oncogenesis. Finally, in the third aim, we seek to more holistically define how variant-
harboring regulatory elements and target genes may play a role in HSC self-renewal and function through the
use of a multiplexed guide-swap Cas9 genome editing approach in primary human hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells. Collectively, the studies we propose in this grant will provide new insights into how inherited risk
variants can provide selection pressures that enable MPNs to arise."
10867307,"We propose to further enhance Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) Sporozoite (SPZ)-based vaccines
against malaria that are the only immunogens proven to induce >90% short term (3 weeks) and long
term (at least 14 months) protection against controlled human malaria infection with Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf) in humans. Using a unique glycolipid adjuvant 7DW8-5, the goal is to prolong the
duration of vaccine efficacy (VE) and to increase efficacy in endemic settings. In the mouse model
using P. yoelii (Py) sporozoites (SPZ) we achieved > 80% protection at 16 weeks with 2 dose and 4
dose accelerated regimens of irr PySPZ plus 7DW8-5 adjuvant administered by direct venous
inoculation (DVI) representing a 2-fold enhancement over irr PySPZ without adjuvant. The adjuvant
could be mixed with irr PySPZ. High level (>80%) protection of mice persisted at 16 weeks with irr
PySPZ by DVI, in the presence of 7DW8-5, but not by non-DVI routes. Manufacturing of 7DW8-5
under cGMPs was completed and in a pilot study with P. knowlesi (Pk) SPZ, irr PkSPZ we achieved
50% VE and no improvement with the adjuvant, likely attributable to sub-optimal comparative dose or
dosing regimens, or the short-term infectious challenge design. Due to the excellent demonstrable
safety record of the combined SPZ-adjuvant vaccine in NHPs, and comparable bioactivity on co-
culture human iNKT cells in vitro, we propose further optimization of dosing regimens for durable
immunity in pig-tailed macaques, the natural host for Pk, along with protection studies to assess
adjuvant effects on chemically attenuated (PySPZ-chemoprophylaxis vaccine CVac) and genetically
attenuated (PySPZ-LARC) in mice. Using humanized HISA2/ hCD1d mice possessing functional
human CD8+ T cells and human iNKT cells (cellular targets of 7DW8-5) we will investigate whether a
PfSPZ-7DW8-5 combination immunogen can enhance the human CD8+ T-cell response to PfSPZ.
Adjuvant-associated biomarker discovery studies are also planned in mice. Towards clinical use of
the PfSPZ-7DW8-5 combination vaccine, we will establish stability criteria and formulation
methodologies for 7DW8-5, and further comparability testing of GMP-grade 7DW8-5 for bioactivity in
vitro as a lot release attribute and humanized HISA2/ hCD1d mice in vivo, compile a pre-IND package
in preparation for pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of the safety and efficacy of 7DW8-5-PfSPZ
combinations, and manufacture GMP 7DW8-5 for clinical use. Because studies outlined in this project
will be conducted with clinical grade, well characterized 7DW8-5, a positive outcome in our studies
will place us in a position to rapidly design and conduct formal pre-clinical toxicology and/or
biodistribution studies in compliance with FDA mandates for a speedier path to the clinic. Completion
of this project will mark the first development of an adjuvant for a live eukaryotic parasite vaccine."
10865152,"At least 10% of Veterans seeking help in VA audiology clinics have clinically normal audiograms, a
figure that broadly confirms a recent prevalence study indicating that 33.6% of current active-duty military
Service Members are at risk of hearing and communication deficits despite having normal-hearing thresholds.
While a considerable amount of research effort over the past 20 years has been devoted to understanding the
potential causes for hearing difficulties in patients with normal hearing sensitivity, comparatively little research
effort has been devoted to rehabilitation and improvement of function for these patients. This predicament has
left audiologists and other medical professionals with very few evidence-based options to provide care for the
large segment of help-seeking Veterans struggling with functional hearing difficulties. Currently, audiologic
standard of care (SOC) for these patients involves reassurance of normal hearing and providing general
communication tips, though evidence suggests that many patients are unsatisfied with this approach and
request further testing and rehabilitation options. To help address patient concerns, many VA audiologists are
now prescribing hearing aids though there is very little data on whether these devices improve functional
outcomes for patients with self-reported hearing difficulties and normal hearing sensitivity. Therefore, the
purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of device-based rehabilitation options with current standard of
care for Veterans with self-reported hearing and communication problems, and to identify subgroups in the
sample that may benefit differently depending upon patient-specific characteristics and needs. The general
hypothesis is that most Veterans with hearing difficulties and normal audiograms will benefit from device-based
auditory rehabilitation as reflected by decreases in perceived hearing handicap. However, the amount of
benefit will vary according to patient-specific characteristics including auditory, psychological and cognitive
factors in combination with the type and severity of auditory dysfunction experienced by the patient.
 All study participants will be Veterans with normal to near-normal pure-tone sensitivity but with
moderate to severe perceived hearing handicap who are interested in seeking professional help. Participants
will be interviewed to gather data regarding their hearing difficulties, including the context and impacts of
difficulties as well as goals for auditory rehabilitation. Next, participants will undergo assessments of peripheral
and central auditory system function including electrophysiological and behavioral measures and cognitive and
psychological status assessed using established NIH Toolbox® measures. Participant medical charts will be
reviewed to gather data on comorbid conditions and previous exposures known to be risk factors for
developing auditory processing difficulties. These data will be compiled to provide an estimate of the
distribution of characteristics likely to impact auditory function and response to intervention among Veterans
seeking help for functional hearing difficulties. Participants will then be randomized into one of following three
intervention arms: 1. SOC, 2. SOC + hearing aids, or 3. SOC + hearing aids with remote microphone.
Outcomes will be measured at two- and six-months post-intervention. The primary outcome measure is the
Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults. Secondary outcome measures are aimed at identifying the underlying
mechanisms and potential mediators that influence whether and how participants receive benefit from hearing
devices. These will include measures of speech understanding in quiet and noise, objective and subjective
listening effort, electrophysiological measures of neural responses to sound, and interviews to learn more
about participants' perceptions of the intervention. Interaction effects will be estimated between treatment arm
and patient characteristics to identify key moderating factors that influence the degree and direction of benefit
associated with different treatment strategies. This information can then be used to inform both clinical decision
making for individual patients and the design of future intervention studies."

 Prevalence rates for suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious behavior (SSIB) in youth aged 10 to 14 years
have increased in the past two years at alarming rates. As a result, the NIMH issued two Notice of Special
Interest (NOSI) for the assessment and prevention of SSIB among children and preteens. Pediatric emergency
departments (EDs) have become an essential and often routine mental health (MH) service for youth. While
youth MH has recently been deemed a national public health crisis, overburdened EDs have continued to endure
a two decade-long increase in youth presenting with MH emergencies. Increases in pediatric MH presentations
have been observed throughout the U.S., with suicide rates for youth 10 to 18 years being the second leading
cause of death. However, effective ED interventions to increase linkage to appropriate MH care are lacking.
Adaptive interventions, which provide a tailored approach to the type, intensity, and timing of treatment, are well-
matched for addressing this need and youth heterogeneity. The scientific premise of this application is supported
by youth psychiatric emergency research and gaps in the literature. The purpose of this study is to refine and
pilot a brief, culturally and identity sensitive, adaptive ED intervention via Sequential Multiple
Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design that targets individual and systemic barriers to care to
increased linkage to subsequent community-based MH care for youth 10 to 14 years after an ED
admission and referral. This study employs an ecological approach within a socio-cultural theoretic framework
for the study of MH service disparities. This intervention is informed by the literature, ED interventions, a family-
based approach, and directly targets three presumptive mechanisms: 1) MH literacy, 2) MH communication, and
3) MH engagement. Primary outcomes, measured at 2-weeks and 4-, and 6-month, include increased linkage to
MH care (attendance), reduced SSIB symptoms and severity, and the engagement of the purported therapeutic
mechanisms. This study is innovative because it offers a brief, family-based SMART to meet the needs of the
diverse population of youth and caregivers served in the ED. This proposal aligns well with the NIMH Strategic
Plan Objectives 4.1 & 4.3, to “improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and reach of MH services through research”
and “develop innovative service delivery models to dramatically improve the outcomes of MH services received
in diverse communities and populations,” respectively. This research has the potential to directly inform youth
ED settings and has significant implications for dissemination."
10869056,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a common chronic condition that affects over 1 billion people worldwide.
Clinically, OSA is defined using the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) which quantifies the rate of respiratory events.
Recent evidence suggests that AHI has demonstrable limitations including poor predictive ability and relationship
to outcomes. To overcome the limitations of AHI, our group has recently developed “ventilatory burden”, a fully
automated breath-by-breath measure of abnormal breathing overnight, which is independent of hypoxia or
arousal consequences, as an alternative metric better suited in clinical management of OSA. Another pathway
that several groups have attempted to overcome the limitations of AHI is to use wearable devices that are easy
to use and provide surrogates of AHI (e.g., WatchPAT, Oximetry etc.). However, these devices do not
characterize the underlying ventilatory burden in OSA, which first and foremost is a sleep-related “breathing”
disorder. Further, the exclusion of EEG in these devices implies that the denominator for AHI, which is the total
sleep time, is estimated and not accurate. In this proposal, we aim to tackle both these issues by investigating
the utility of a low-profile, low-cost, non-commercial, open-source wearable sensor system (SLEEPTRONIX),
with physical resemblance to adhesive bandages that can monitor the requisite signals for fully characterizing
OSA pathophysiology (EEG/EOG/airflow/SpO2). Using innovative algorithms, we aim to show that the
SLEEPTRONIX derives accurate estimates of not only clinically used AHI metric, but also the ventilatory burden
which overcomes limitations of AHI. Using N=30 subjects newly diagnosed with OSA, and age, sex matched
healthy controls our primary aim is to develop and refine the SLEEPTRONIX system for continuous assessment
of multiple night’s sleep and breathing patterns. In addition, we will refine our SLEEPTRONIX system to measure
circadian rhythm parameters using temperature and cortisol levels that are assessed using novel
nanotechnologies. The successful completion of above aims will establish that sacrificing on the requisite
measurements of characterizing an individual’s underlying OSA is avoidable, and the use of wearables coupled
with innovative measurements of underlying ventilatory deficit in OSA has the potential to shift the paradigm in
OSA management."

10870677,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Precise control of voluntary movement is crucial for almost all behaviors and the quality of life. While many
brain regions are involved in the process, the interaction between the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum is
particularly essential. When the cerebellum communicates with the cerebral cortex, it sends signals to the
thalamus, which relays the information to the cerebral cortex. This cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit has been
studied extensively because of its functional significance. However, the current understanding of the circuit is
based mainly on anatomical connection and the assumption that neurons within each brain region behave
similarly. Molecular and physiological heterogeneity within the neuronal population is barely considered, posing
a challenge in understanding how the circuit allows coordinated movements of the entire body. First, although
the cerebellum projects axons to various thalamic subregions, the strength of synaptic transmission
substantially varies. Therefore, the anatomical connection does not accurately represent the functional
organization of the circuit. Second, many recent studies showed that a neuronal population, traditionally
considered a single group, can be divided into several subtypes based on their distinct gene expression
profiles. These molecularly defined neuronal subtypes often show different physiological properties and
anatomical connectivity, engaged in distinct functional circuits. Recently, we studied the functional properties of
the ventrolateral thalamus (VL), one of the thalamic subregions and the primary target of the cerebellum. While
the VL is traditionally considered a homogenous neuronal population, our preliminary data showed substantial
variation in their excitability and synaptic properties, which might reflect previously unrecognized connectivity
between the cerebellum and the VL. Furthermore, a recent study showed that VL neurons consist of several
subtypes exhibiting distinct patterns of gene expression. These data suggest that the functional organization of
the cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit is finer and more sophisticated than previously thought. In the proposed
research, we will perform whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and circuit tracing with the transgenic mice that
label the molecularly defined VL neuron subtypes. We will study their projection patterns to the cerebral cortex
and their contribution to the functional heterogeneity in the VL (Aim 1). We will also examine their presynaptic
origin in the cerebellar nuclei and the extent to which the cerebellar nuclei contribute to the functional
heterogeneity in the VL (Aim 2). Successful completion of this project is expected to provide novel insight into
the organization of the motor circuit."
10891686,"Project Summary/Abstract - Project 4: Mechanistic Basics of FLASH Effect: Role of O2
Recently, exciting and unexpected new data in several animal models strongly supports the premise that ultra-
high dose rate irradiation termed FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT) can result in significant sparing of normal
tissue while preserving tumor responses, effectively leading to significant increases in the therapeutic window
for improving radiotherapy outcomes. However, the mechanisms for this effect are currently unknown. Project 4
will build on the exciting preliminary data that carbogen (95% O2; 5% CO2) breathing significantly diminished the
protection of normal brain tissue while enhancing the responses of tumors. This result as well as theoretical
considerations of the differential redox reactions of O2 in cancer versus normal tissues provides the impetus to
study the reactions of O2 as drivers of the differential responses of normal and cancer tissue to FLASH-RT.
These considerations have led to the central hypothesis in Project 4 that differential metabolism of organic
hydroperoxides (ROOH) in cancer versus normal tissues following FLASH-RT, caused by differences in
labile Fe pools and lipid peroxidation chain reactions, mediates the differential responses of tumor vs.
normal tissues to FLASH-RT. This hypothesis will be pursed in the following Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine how varying the O2 tension that animals breathe alters the structural integrity of the
vasculature, mature neuronal morphology, activation of inflammatory responses, and neurocognitive effects of
FLASH-RT versus conventional dose rate exposure.
Specific Aim 2: Determine if changes in O2 in tumor versus normal tissues following FLASH-RT using Oxylite
measurements correlate with measurements of ROOH and downstream products of lipid peroxidation in animal
tissues exposed to FLASH-RT at doses where normal tissue sparing is observed.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the causal involvement of organic hydroperoxides and redox active metal ions in the
differential sensitivity of tumor versus normal tissues using pharmacological and genetic approaches to
manipulate glutathione peroxidases (GPx) 1 and 4 as well as metal chelators that inhibit Fe redox cycling.
Scientific Impact: The successful completion of this project will clearly define biochemical mechanisms
involving organic hydroperoxide metabolism and redox active iron metabolism underlying the selective sparing
of normal tissues from FLASH-RT in mouse models of brain cancer therapy as well as providing a new paradigm
for using FLASH-RT to exploit fundamental differences in cancer vs. normal cell metabolism for increasing
treatment efficacy while protecting normal tissues.
Integration into the P01: Project 4 will interact with all projects in the P01 by providing genetically manipulated
brain cancer cells that conditionally overexpress GPx 1 and 4 as well as ferritin and validated biomarkers of
oxidative stress for testing mechanisms of oxidative metabolism in models of FLASH-RT."

10891690,"PROJECT SUMMARY: DOSIMETRY, PHYSICS & MODELING CORE
We are proposing the creation of a research program entitled, “Increasing the therapeutic index of brain tumor
treatment through innovative FLASH radiotherapy (FLASH-RT), focused on translating a novel irradiation
modality rapidly into the clinic. The overall hypothesis to be tested is whether radiation delivered at ultra high
dose rates (compared to the much lower dose rates used in current clinical practice) can significantly ameliorate
normal tissue complications while maintaining acceptable if not improved tumor control. To test this hypothesis,
the program will deploy a comprehensive series of preclinical studies that will critically evaluate tumor control,
neurocognitive outcomes and resultant radiation injury to the brain following FLASH-RT and conventional dose
rate irradiation. Collectively, these studies will generate the requisite data sets required for the rapid translation
of the novel FLASH irradiation platform to the clinical scenario. Preclinical studies in mice assessing orthotopic
tumor control, cognition, neuronal and vascular structural plasticity, immune-modulation and oxygen dependent
mechanisms of radiation injury are coupled with a clinical trial in GBM dog patients to inform the oncologists of
the potential benefits of this potentially paradigm shifting technology. The objectives of this program project will
be facilitated by the activities conducted by the Dosimetry, Physics & Modeling Core (Core 2) and the
Neurobehavioral Core (Core 3).
The Core 2 will develop three key innovations that will enable the rapid translation of FLASH-RT in to the clinic.
First, we will develop and characterize dosimetric tools to accurately measure ultra-high dose rate beams. This
will allow us to cross-validate the dosimetry between electron and photon FLASH radiation beams at each
participating institution (Lausanne University Hospital, Stanford and Indiana Universities). Second, we will build
and commission the first small animal conformal photon FLASH irradiation platform that will allow us to
characterize the FLASH phenomenon with greater clinical relevance. Third, we will develop and implement the
“turn-key” technology for the conversion of a clinical medical linear accelerator to an experimental FLASH
irradiator (Indiana University).
The success of this innovative program project grant is bolstered by the unparalleled breadth and depth of
our multi-disciplinary investigative team at UC Irvine, Stanford University, SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, CHUV and Indiana University that has pioneered the development of the initial experimental
infrastructure for conducting FLASH RT research and produced strong preclinical evidence of increased
therapeutic index, comprising expertise in radiation oncology, radiobiology, medical physics, and preclinical
imaging and accelerator science.
In summary, Core 2 will develop the necessary dosimetric tools to support all projects, enable the cross validation
of the dosimetry between all participating sites and between beam qualities, and thus ensuring experimental
reproducibility between the irradiations systems at Lausanne University Hospital, Stanford and Indiana
Universities."
10895403,"Abstract/Summary
The development of methods for molecule construction and functionalization has expedited the drug
development process during the past decades. To this end, enzymatic C–H functionalization represents a
powerful approach to enable rapid molecular construction. Harnessing the ubiquitous C–H bonds in organic
molecules and genetic tunability of protein catalysts, enzymatic C–H functionalization provides sustainable
strategies to effect chemical transformations with high selectivity and efficiency. Despite significant advances,
the reaction scope of current enzymatic C–H functionalization is restricted to chemical reactivities acquired
through natural evolution. This limitation hampers the applications of enzymes for drug development as many
medicinally important chemical motifs are rarely present or even completely absent in biology. To expand the
chemical space of biosynthesis, we herein aim to develop new biocatalytic systems by repurposing
metalloenzymes for C–H functionalization reactions currently not present in biology. By integrating protein
engineering, computational modeling, organic synthesis, and biochemical and inorganic spectroscopic
analysis, we will create collections of metalloenzyme catalysts that can directly functionalize inert C(sp3)–H
bonds to install biomedically relevant chemical moieties. We envision that the enzymes we create will not
only provide powerful genetically encoded tools for numerous synthetic and biological applications, but will
also offer a fertile ground to enrich our fundamental knowledge of biochemistry and enzymatic catalysis"
10895459,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hypertension (HTN) remains an important medical and public health issue in the United States. Most current
therapeutic measures are targeted against the peripheral renin-angiotensin system (RAS). These therapies have
reduced the morbidity and mortality in hypertensive patients. However, the long-term prognosis in patients with
hypertension remains poor, and new therapeutic approaches are needed. We previously showed that inhibiting
brain ADAM17 (A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) upregulation will
reduce the progression of HTN. Our recent work indicates that kinin B1 receptor (B1R) activation leads to
elevated inflammation in key autonomic brain regions such as the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN)
and pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of B1R attenuates neurogenic HTN. In addition, our
preliminary data shows that B1R expression is elevated in the PVN of hypertensive human subjects. Evidence
suggests that elevated kininase I (carboxypeptidase, CPN/CPM that cleaves bradykinin into des-Arg9-
bradykinin, an endogenous agonist for B1R) levels account for increasing endogenous levels of B1R agonists,
leading to subsequent upregulation and activation of B1R. Stimulation of B1R results in ADAM17 activation that
in turn transactivates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the exact signal transduction
mechanisms of B1R and Kininase I, and interactions of AT1R, ADAM17 and EGFR with B1R, in HTN are not
clear. Therefore, in this proposal, we test the central hypothesis that the blockade of B1R signaling in the brain
reduces inflammation and oxidative stress, thereby decreasing sympathoexcitation, leading to attenuation of
neurogenic HTN. This hypothesis will be tested by following specific aims: (1) Determine whether targeted
blockade of B1R signaling attenuates neurogenic HTN, (2) Identify the causal role of central B1R activation to
the development of neurogenic HTN, and (3) Elucidate the signaling mechanisms and functional interactions
between B1R and AT1R/ADAM17/EGFR in the PVN in neurogenic HTN. In terms of approaches, we will use
state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo pharmacological and molecular methods combined with novel and unique
genetic models to investigate the signaling mechanisms of B1R in HTN. This project will identify novel and vital
role of B1R signaling in HTN and provide insights for developing new therapeutics for the treatment of human
neurogenic HTN."

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects 8-10% of US children. Primary care providers (PCPs)
care for most children with ADHD but quality gaps in ADHD treatment, with sociodemographic disparities as a
potential driver, may lead to life-long morbidity and/or unnecessary treatments. There is an urgent need to
develop quality measures for ADHD treatment, as a prerequisite for mitigating disparities and improving health
outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to leverage recent advances in machine learning (ML) methods –
enabling the analysis of electronic health record (EHR) data of an entire patient population – to develop robust
quality measures for ADHD treatment, and to prepare for quality improvement interventions. This K23 proposal
will accelerate Dr. Bannett’s transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goal to
improve community-based primary health care for children with developmental and behavioral disorders. His
multidisciplinary team of mentors include Heidi Feldman (ADHD research mentor), C. Jason Wang (health care
technology & health services co-mentor), and Grace Lee (quality improvement & implementation science co-
mentor). This nationally recognized team of physician scientists will assure Dr. Bannett achieves his goals, to
(1) apply machine learning techniques to assess quality of care while mitigating bias, (2) advance research
skills in advanced statistics and in qualitative methods, (3) build expertise in quality improvement and
implementation science methods, and (4) enhance professional skills and transition to independence. Dr.
Bannett’s clinical and research experiences, his mentoring team, and the environment at Stanford, position him
to achieve the proposal’s aims. Building upon his experiences in analyzing EHR data and successes in piloting
a natural language processing pipeline, Dr. Bannett has the following specific aims: (1) to develop guideline-
based quality measures that combine ML analysis of free text with structured EHR data to assess PCP
treatment of children aged 4-11 years with ADHD, (2) to assess PCP adherence to evidence-based guidelines
for ADHD treatment and to detect disparities in care and minimize related bias in ML models, (3) to prioritize
quality improvement interventions aimed at improving ADHD care and mitigating disparities that family and
clinician stakeholders consider feasible, acceptable, and important. Aligned with the NIMH’s strategic plan, this
proposal will (1) strengthen collaboration between stakeholders to continuously improve evidence-based
practices in primary care settings, (2) identify and prioritize targets for planned PCP- and systems-level quality
improvement interventions aimed at standardizing ADHD care and mitigating disparities, and (3) apply novel
technologies that provide real-time feedback and continuous monitoring of high-quality ADHD care. With future
R01 funding, Dr. Bannett will cross-validate developed quality measures in a national network of pediatric
healthcare systems, and, in parallel, implement data-driven quality improvement interventions."
10895389,"Preterm infants in the NICU are fed human milk from their own mothers or donors, and exposed to a variety of handling practices, including fresh mother’s milk, frozen and thawed mother’s milk and Holder pasteurized donor milk. Freeze-thaw cycles and pasteurization can alter the structure of milk proteases and proteins, and these alterations can affect the release of milk peptides. Milk peptides present in the infant intestine have an array of activities including antimicrobial, and enterocyte- and macrophage-immunomodulatory. Differences in milk sources, processing, and storage may yield differential release of bioactive peptides, and therefore differential activities in the gastrointestinal tract of infants. There is a critical need to evaluate effects of milk handling practices on release of peptides within the infant and their bioactivities. Our long-term goal is to determine feeding practices for preterm infants that promote optimal ex utero development and growth. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify how common milk handling practices affect the release of gut health-promoting peptides within the preterm infant intestine. Our central hypothesis is that the identity and amounts of milk peptides released within the intestine of preterm infants fed with these milks will be markedly different and therefore will have different profiles of antimicrobial, and enterocyte- and macrophage-immunomodulatory actions. Our specific aims are to determine the 1) antimicrobial and bifidogenic activities, 2) enterocyte-immunomodulatory activity, and 3) macrophage- immunomodulatory activity of peptides in the intestinal contents of preterm infants fed fresh mother’s milk (MM), frozen and thawed mother’s milk (FTMM), Holder-pasteurized mother’s milk (HPMM) and Holder- pasteurized donor milk (HPDM). Our approach will be to collect intestinal samples from preterm neonates within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) after feeding milk exposed to different handling practices, extract the peptide component from these samples, test their antibacterial, bifidogenic and enterocyte- and macrophage-immunomodulatory activity in vitro, and identify the peptides via mass spectrometry and database searching techniques. This research is innovative because it identifies the bioactivities of peptides released during in vivo intestinal digestion and examines the effect of human milk handling practices. At the conclusion of this project, we expect to have determined 1) the extent to which milk peptides released in the preterm infant intestine express gut health-related bioactivity; and 2) how different milk handling practices affect peptide release and bioactivity. The positive impact of this research is that it will help determine optimal milk handling practices for preterm infants, and possibly supplementation strategies for milk that will lead to improved bioactivity within the infant gut."

particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), has been shown to elicit inflammatory and oxidative stress
responses, and is linked to impairment in lung function, development of chronic lung disease, and respiratory
hospitalizations. While HIV is hypothesized to increase susceptibility to cigarette smoke, whether this extends to
other pollutants remains unknown, as is the contribution of pollution to the risk for lung disease among PLWH.
The Study of HIV Infection in the Etiology of Lung Disease (SHIELD) is an ongoing, prospective cohort of over
2600 individuals with or at-risk for HIV that has made significant contributions to our understanding of HIV-
associated lung function impairment and respiratory morbidity. SHIELD has demonstrated that HIV leads to
unique physiologic changes in the lung, including increased risk for airflow obstruction and deficiencies in gas
exchange, accelerated decline in lung function, and increased respiratory morbidity. However, the contribution
of environmental exposures to excess respiratory morbidity among PLWH is unknown. To address this gap, we
propose to extend SHIELD to address our overarching hypothesis that PLWH represent a population that
is uniquely susceptible to the health effects of air pollution and that pollutant exposure contributes to
the excess lung function impairment and respiratory morbidity among PLWH. Three independent but
complementary aims build upon the long-standing experience of the SHIELD cohort and add the expertise of
investigators in studying health effects of outdoor and household air pollution in vulnerable populations. Aim 1
will define the impact of outdoor air pollution exposure to both acute and chronic respiratory morbidity and lung
function decline among PLWH and comparable HIV-uninfected participants. Aim 2 will determine the association
between household air pollution and respiratory morbidity among PLWH. Aim 3 will characterize biologic
response to air pollution exposure, assessing whether HIV is associated with increased internal dose of exposure
and/or exaggerated oxidative host airway and systemic response. We will apply novel approaches through
molecular markers assessed with albumin adductome mass spectrometry. In all aims, we will examine how HIV
and markers of HIV control influence susceptibility to pollution. Successful completion of these aims will advance
our understanding of mechanisms and impact of air pollution in the setting of HIV. Further, our findings could
identify therapeutic targets among high-risk populations and guide development of interventions to improve
respiratory health and healthy aging among PLWH."
10895412,"ABSTRACT: Progesterone (P4) is a key sex hormone governing the physiological changes of the menstrual
cycle. We and others have shown that it also has anti-inflammatory effects on the immune system locally in the
female reproductive tract (FRT), but the mechanisms are not well understood. There are also indications that
its immune effects reach beyond the FRT and affect immunity systemically. P4’s effects are likely modified by
the more pro-inflammatory effects of estradiol (E2). A detailed understanding of the mechanisms behind
P4’s immune activities at local and systemic sites, and its interactions with E2, may contribute to
women’s health by explaining sex-based and menstrual cycle-related fluctuations in inflammatory
diseases. Some inflammatory diseases fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, suggesting that P4 has
systemic immune effects. For example, asthma and inflammatory bowel disease worsen in the P4-low
follicular phase, while rheumatoid arthritis often improves in the P4-dominant luteal phase. On the other hand,
P4-induced immunosuppression could limit the response to vaccination or resistance to infection.
P4 surges during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, reaching >40 times above follicular phase levels. Our
data show a clear immunological difference in the FRT between the phases: luteal inhibition of macrophage-
tropic chemokines by P4. Monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) are antigen-presenting cells
(APC), which provide key signals for the localization and survival of resident memory T cells (TRM).
We propose complementary human and mouse studies: (1) a human cohort with studies at the APC level,
probing their connections to TRM in the FRT and other barrier sites and (2) mouse experiments to corroborate
P4’s immunological properties in combination with E2 and to test the hypothesis that vaginal CCL2/CCL4
administration partially reverses P4-induced immune suppression.
In Aim 1, we will recruit a clinical cohort to study the effects of the P4-dominant luteal phase in humans
on APC and TRM activation and function in the FRT, the gastrointestinal tract, the upper respiratory tract, the
skin, and the blood. We will use MSD-based immune factor profiling of secretions and flow cytometry and
single cell RNA sequencing of mucosal cells to address three hypotheses: (1) inhibition of APC-tropic
chemokine production is a hallmark of barrier site immunosuppression during the luteal phase; (2) mucosal
APCs are fewer or less inflammatory during the luteal than the follicular phase; and (3) the APC and cytokine
changes during the luteal phase associate with lower number and/or activation status of TRM.
In Aim 2, we will use mouse models to establish a causal link between P4 treatment, chemokine
production, and APC & TRM frequencies and activation state. We will address two hypotheses: (1) P4
inhibits production of CCL2 and CCL4 in major barrier tissues, reducing APC and TRM frequencies and/or
functional potential; and (2) vaginal CCL2/4 administration prevents P4-induced suppression of APC and TRM."
10895587,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Routinely prescribed analgesic opioids are potent activators of the mu-opioid receptor (µOR; OPRM1 gene),
expressed in many cancer types, and can impact cancer cell survival and the efficacy of lifesaving
chemotherapy. For patients with cancer, opioid use often coincides with chemotherapy, making opioid-
chemotherapy interactions inevitable. For some cancers, including lung, prostate, gastric, breast, and
esophageal cancers, opioid use and increased µOR expression are linked to increased tumor growth,
metastases, and shorter patient survival. In contrast, in vitro and animal model studies for glioblastoma, certain
breast cancers, and T- and B-cell acute leukemias, opioids stimulate cancer cell death and, in some cases,
enhance cytotoxic chemotherapeutic response. The seemingly paradoxical effects likely have a concentration-
dependent dimension as physiologic opioid exposures have tended to induce pro-proliferative effects while
supraphysiologic opioid exposures are typically associated with cancer cell death. While µOR activation can
enhance the killing effect of genotoxic chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, our preliminary data
demonstrate opioids antagonize the apoptotic response of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) chronic
myeloid leukemia cells (K562) to molecularly-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) chemotherapy. As
leukemias are treated with both genotoxic and molecularly targeted chemotherapy assessing the potential for
clinically used opioids to antagonize or synergize in leukemic cell killing is an urgent medical need. We
propose to test the central hypothesis, that chemotherapeutic response will change in the presence of
clinically relevant concentrations of opioids, in three Aims. Specific Aim 1: Quantify standard-of-care
opioid exposures and determinants of exposure in patients with leukemia. Hypothesis 1: Interpatient variability
in opioid exposure will exceed 50% due to inherent metabolic differences, disease status, and treatment-
related pharmacokinetic alterations. Specific Aim 2: In leukemic cell lines, changes in response to
chemotherapy based on leukemic subtype and µOR function will be determined. Hypothesis 2: Clinically-
experienced concentrations of opioids will change chemotherapeutic response in different leukemic subtypes
corresponding with µOR function by >25%. Specific Aim 3: In patients with leukemia, the frequency of opioid-
chemotherapy DDIs based on clinical and molecular factors will be determined. Hypothesis 3: Clinical and
molecular features associated with opioid-chemotherapy DDI conferring chemotherapy resistance are present
in >20% of patients prescribed opioids. Understanding the impact of µOR activity on chemotherapeutic
response across similar but biologically distinct leukemia cell types will provide new insights into mechanisms
underlying drug resistance, relapse, or non-response and drive precision medicine in opioid prescribing. This
proposal will provide key preliminary data to support an NIH R01 aimed at predicting altered chemotherapeutic
response due to supportive care medication exposure among patients undergoing treatment for leukemia."

This Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) by the National Cancer Institute is
designed to provide the principal investigator Dr. Naykky Singh Ospina with the support to become an
independent investigator in the field of patient centered thyroid cancer care. There is an epidemic of thyroid
cancer diagnosis that directly harms patients and overwhelms the medical system. Indiscriminate biopsy of
thyroid nodules without engagement of patients in the decision making process leads to over diagnosis of more
than 50% of the 50,000 patients that are diagnosed with thyroid cancer annually in the United States.
Conversation aids can support shared decision making in clinical practice and allow patients and clinicians to
collaborate and find the medical decision that fits the needs of individual patients. As such, a conversation aid
to support the decision making regarding the need for thyroid biopsy and thyroid cancer diagnosis, is a novel
proposal that can lead to a more careful approach to thyroid cancer diagnosis. The proposed research seeks
to: AIM1. Update a conversation aid prototype that was developed to support shared decision making in the
diagnosis of thyroid cancer and AIM2. Conduct a pilot clinical trial to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a
larger study evaluating the efficacy of this conversation aid in supporting shared decision making, decreasing
the number of unnecessary thyroid biopsies and leading to improved patient centered thyroid cancer diagnosis.
To achieve AIM1, we will conduct semi-structured interviews of patients and clinicians who have used the
conversation aid in the decision-making process and evaluate recordings of these clinical visits, to obtain
through qualitative research methods an in-depth understanding of their experience using the conversation aid
and feedback to update the conversation aid prototype. In AIM2, this updated conversation aid will be used in a
pilot randomized trial, where patients presenting for evaluation of thyroid nodules will be randomized to receive
counseling about thyroid biopsy and thyroid cancer diagnosis, to receive care using conversation aid
(intervention group) or not using the conversation aid (control group). The results of this study will inform the
feasibility and design of a larger study, to evaluate the efficacy of supporting shared decision making on the
rate of unnecessary thyroid biopsies and thyroid cancer diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to
support shared decision-making and patient centered thyroid cancer diagnosis. Dr. Singh Ospina, will receive
formal course work in qualitative research, communication and implementation science, and clinical trials
design. In addition, she has an exceptional and committed multidisciplinary mentoring team that includes
internationally recognized experts in the fields of interest. This team will support her career development and
mentored research experience. The long term goals are for Dr. Singh Ospina to become an independent
investigator in the field of patient centered thyroid cancer care and evaluating a conversation aid that can help
decrease the over diagnosis of thyroid cancer, and it’s harms."

Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer is uniformly fatal, representing the second-leading cause of
cancer-related death among men in the United States. Despite therapeutic advances with docetaxel, abiraterone
and enzalutamide, prostate cancer progression to lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains a
major clinical problem. Rapidly proliferating cancer cells upregulate de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol
synthesis pathways in order to provide lipids for membrane formation and lipid modification of proteins and to
support energy production. The sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are master regulatory
transcription factors that activate genes encoding enzymes required for synthesis of cholesterol and unsaturated
fatty acids. The SREBPs are frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer and other solid tumors and are
associated with tumor aggressiveness and unfavorable outcomes. Interestingly, emerging studies suggest that
in African American (AA) prostate cancer patients - who already have 1.6 times higher prostate cancer incidence
and 2.6 times higher mortality from prostate cancer than Caucasian males - the androgen receptor and
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways are more active than in Caucasian prostate cancer patients, frequently
resulting in even greater increase in lipid metabolism. Androgen receptor and the PI3K/Akt signaling can activate
the transcription factor MNX1, leading to induction of SREBP1, which controls expression of numerous lipogenic
genes including FASN, and alters the metabolic state of the prostate cancer cell. Inactivation of SREBPs
represents a novel mechanism by which metabolically-driven tumors can be targeted. The overarching goal of
this preclinical study is to establish key proof-of-concept efficacy and safety data for the use of SREBP inhibitors
against prostate cancer cells, using extensive in vitro and in vivo models. Our proposed studies are focused on
1) defining the function of SREBPs in prostate cancer and identifying biologically significant lipid products of
SREBP activation, 2) evaluating effects and mechanisms of a small molecule inhibitor of SREBP in vitro, and 3)
assessing the anticancer activity of SREBP inhibitors alone and in combination with existing drugs, using cell
line xenograft and innovative patient-derived xenograft models of prostate cancer."
10911833,"Cigarette smoking has profound negative effects on oral health. Smoking cessation decreases the incidence
and progression of oral health problems. Most smokers attempt to quit, but the majority of quit attempts are
unaided by smoking cessation medications and end in relapse. The American Dental Hygienists Association
recommends that all oral health professionals Ask patients if they smoke, Advise smokers to quit, and Refer
smokers to quitlines for counseling (Ask-Advise-Refer; AAR). AAR connects patients directly to counseling but
not to medication, which can double cessation rates independent of counseling. Indeed, few dentists prescribe
cessation medications. Failure to connect smokers to medication is a critical missed opportunity to prevent
disease and save lives. Nicotine Replacement Therapy Sampling (NRTS) refers to providing all smokers,
regardless of current interest in quitting, with free samples of over-the-counter NRT products and brief use
instructions. NRTS has been shown to increase quit attempts and smoking abstinence rates. Dental settings
are an ideal fit for NRTS because NRTS could easily be combined with AAR and providing samples of oral
care products is routine and universal in dental care settings. The proposed UG3/UH3 project will test the
effectiveness of NRTS in dental practices. In the 2-year Clinical Trial Planning Phase (UG3), we will complete
all required milestones to establish feasibility and acceptability of study protocols and prepare for the 3-year
Clinical Trial Implementation Phase (UH3). UG3 activities will include stakeholder interviews to evaluate initial
acceptability and feasibility of proposed study interventions and procedures, pilot testing, protocol refinement,
and recruitment of practitioners for the UH3 trial. In the UH3 trial, we propose to conduct a cluster randomized,
hybrid type 1 implementation-effectiveness trial comparing AAR + NRTS (NRTS) to enhanced usual care (ET;
AAR + electric toothbrush; N = 50 practitioners, limited to 1 per practice; N = 1200 patients) recruited from the
Northeast and Midwest Regions of the National Dental Practice-Based Research Network. Study interventions
will be delivered within the practices by trained practice staff. Our central hypothesis is that NRTS will produce
greater abstinence rates than ET. Our primary outcome will be biologically verified, 7-day point prevalence
abstinence at 6-months post-intervention. We also predict that compared to ET, NRTS will increase rates of
quit attempts, reduce smoking heaviness, and increase NRT utilization. We will conduct a multi-stakeholder
process evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of the NRTS intervention and a cost-effectiveness
analysis to aid future implementation efforts. Overall, we expect that, as a result of this project, we will
establish the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of NRTS in dental practices and determine that NRTS
has high potential for translation to clinical practice."
10896969,"Project Summary/Abstract
All animals possess a robust innate immune response that depends on their ability to recognize viral double-
stranded RNA (dsRNA) as foreign. Yet, animal cells also encode and express dsRNA, and this cellular dsRNA
must be distinguished as “self” to prevent an aberrant immune response. Adenosine deaminases that act on
RNA, or ADARs, deaminate dsRNA to mark it as self and prevent an aberrant immune response. In this capacity
ADARs serve as an ”Innate Immune Checkpoint” (IIC), and recent studies reveal that a decrease in ADAR activity
in tumors releases this IIC, eliciting an immune response that leads to cell death. ADARs are the only IIC known
to date, and proposed studies are designed to fill this gap in knowledge towards the goal of new
immunotherapies. Comparative phylogenetic analyses will be complemented with molecular biology and
biochemistry experiments to identify mitigators, such as ADARs, that prevent inappropriate deployment of
antiviral defense, and ancient incompatibilities, such as invertebrate proteins that may activate an antiviral
response when introduced into vertebrates. Experiments in mammalian cells and mice, and the invertebrate
model organism, C. elegans, will provide a wide phylogenetic sampling to identify, test, and compare new IICs.
Engineered mice and cell lines are in hand, and established assays are in place, to monitor effects on the immune
pathway of both animals. Known dsRNA binding proteins, as well as those identified by immunoprecipitation
strategies, will be prioritized by phylogenetic assays for testing as IICs. In vitro biochemistry experiments, and
structural analyses, will guide subsequent rounds of phylogenetic comparisons. Mammalian ADAR1 p150
prevents an interferon response by modulating the MDA5 arm of the vertebrate innate immune pathway, and
IICs for the RIG-I arm have not been reported. Strategies to identify IICs for the RIG-I arm will focus on enzymes
known to modify the 5' terminus of RNA, a known epitope for RIG-I recognition. The culmination of proposed
studies will be the evaluation of candidate IICs in experimental models of tumorigenesis."
10896970,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lipids play a vital role in maintaining cellular function. Altered lipid metabolism is currently considered a hallmark
characteristic of many diseases such as malignancies, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases,
and diabetes. This has led to a demand for new technologies with comprehensive capabilities for revealing lipid
structure and composition. Such technology is essential for the study of lipid structure-function relationships and
the development of methods to diagnose and treat pathologies. Recent efforts in mass spectrometry (MS)-based
lipidomics, including ion activation methods and chemical derivatization, have expanded the toolbox for lipid
analysis. However, there is no single method at present that is capable of resolving all types of lipid structures
since lipids are structurally diverse and often contain mixtures of isomers. The lack of efficient and reliable
analytical approaches for discerning lipid isomers in biological samples directly leads to the fact that the
physiological roles and functions of lipid isomers remain largely unknown. The central vision of my research
program is to address the deficiencies in lipid structural analysis technology using the unique microdroplet
electrochemical (ME) methods, which take advantage of voltage-controlled electrochemical derivatization of lipid
isomers and the dramatically accelerated rates of electrochemical transformations at microdroplet interfaces to
achieve structural elucidation. The proposed voltage-triggered ME reactions will be performed in a modified
electrospray emitter taking the form of a probe and using standard commercial MS instrumentation. Derivatized
products will generate diagnostic ions specific to particular lipid isomers in tandem mass spectra, allowing
characterization of detailed structures. During the next five years, my research group aims to develop ME probes
for lipid analysis with particular emphasis on isomer identification and quantification so as to realize the promise
of ME as a practical research tool for understanding, diagnosing, and treating diseases. A toolbox of ME
reactions will be developed to characterize various lipid isomers including lipid class, acyl chain length, double-
bond positions, geometries, and sn(stereospecific numbering)-positions, the key information needed for accurate
lipid structure annotation. The ME reactions are diverse and can be triggered by voltage changes, so they will
be cascaded into a single system (a panoptic ME probe) to identify lipid structures at all levels of isomer
specificity in a single experimental run. The ME probe will be used for studying the lipidome of pre-diabetic
mouse heart to reveal the initial lipidomic signature in the heart in response to a Western diet and to define the
deleterious effects of lipid isomers on the development of cardiac pathology. The expected outcome of this
project is to provide a widely applicable approach with enhanced capabilities in lipid structural analysis, which
will uncover structure-function relationships in lipid homeostasis and pathology invisible to current lipid profiling."

Heart failure causes over 80,000 deaths and $30 billion in spending annually, yet therapies that improve
survival and reduce morbidity are underutilized. Insufficient healthcare quality and high costs sparked the
development of value-based payment programs, such as Medicare’s Merit-based Incentive Program (MIPS).
MIPS is the largest clinician value-based payment program in use in the United States. MIPS is intended to
improve the quality of care while reducing costs by altering clinician payments based on clinician performance
on cost and quality measures. MIPS quality measurement is increasing its focus on patient-reported outcome
(PRO) measures, including for heart failure, despite limited evidence that PROs improve heart failure care. Aim
1 will be a pragmatic, single-center randomized trial evaluating whether integration of PRO assessment into
the routine heart failure clinic workflow is feasible and improves health-related quality of life at one year. This
patient-oriented trial will determine if the clinical impact of PRO assessment is worth the costs of data
collection. Aim 2 will evaluate the association between the introduction of MIPS (in 2017) and trends in
Medicare heart failure care: guideline-recommended therapy use, mortality, and costs. This study will use
multiple analytic approaches and controls (VA and commercially insured heart failure patients) to develop
robust estimates of these associations. This work will have a substantial impact on heart failure clinical care
and patient outcomes by defining the effect of both routine PRO assessment and MIPS as a whole. It will
inform the design of future clinician value-based payment models. Dr. Sandhu will use this research along with
the protected time, training, and mentorship of this K23 Award to become an independent, patient-oriented
health services researcher. Dr. Sandhu’s long-term research goals are to improve the quality and efficiency of
heart failure patient care by evaluating the implementation of local quality improvement and national health
policy. The proposed research experience and the training in clinical trials and causal inference statistics
during this award is critical to achieving those goals. He will gain these skills through coursework, local
research seminars, national conferences, and direct instruction from his mentorship team. His mentors are
experts in implementation trials, outcomes analysis, and advanced statistical methods. They are supplemented
with an exceptional advisory committee with complementary expertise in clinical trials, heart failure, and health
policy. With this mentorship team and support from the Stanford Department of Medicine, Dr. Sandhu will have
the tools to efficiently complete the trial in Aim 1. His rigorous training plan, the expertise of his mentors, and
his experience with the data make the sophisticated policy analysis in Aim 2 feasible. Overall, the training,
research, and mentorship of this award will guide Dr. Sandhu in his transition to becoming an independent,
successful patient-oriented health services researcher with the skills to compete for R-level funding."
10897051,"Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is deadly and currently incurable. Approximately 90%
of patients CRPC become resistant to 2nd line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; which primarily target
androgen receptor (AR) signaling and present with bone metastatic disease. Although ADT remains a beneficial
therapy for mCRPC patients, mechanisms of cancer resistance in mCRPC and specifically, in the bone
environment, the most frequent site of CRPC metastasis, is poorly understood. Understanding contributing
factors to PCa disease progression is needed for further development of efficacious therapies. ADT was
previously shown to be critical for differentiation and function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes/neutrophils
(PMNs) which are “first responder” innate immune cells that comprise ~40-50% of the bone marrow cavity. We
recently showed that PMNs are protective against bone metastatic prostate cancer (BM-PCa) however, the PMN
anti-tumoral immune response diminishes as the tumor progresses. To examine PMN phenotypical changes
throughout PCa progression in patients, my group functionally and molecularly characterized peripheral blood
PMNs from PCa patients at different stages: 1) Localized PCa, 2) bone metastatic hormone-sensitive (mCSPC),
and 3) mCRPC patient. We found that PMN function was highly suppressed by 2nd line ADT through increased
receptor 1 expression of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), an anti-inflammatory cytokine important for
promoting BM-PCa and cancer-induced bone disease. Using preclinical bone metastasis mouse models, we
were able to significantly suppress mCRPC growth in bone using 2nd line ADT in combination with either bipolar
androgen therapy (BAT; exogenous testosterone) to boost PMN anti-tumor response OR PMN-specific genetic
deletion of TβR1. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that: anti-tumor PMNs are suppressed/
“switched off” by androgen regulation via TβR1 signaling and this can be leveraged to improve mCRPC
outcomes. This will be tested in the following aims: Aim 1. Define the impact of androgen regulation on PMN
anti-tumor immune response. Aim 2. Determine the mechanism of TβR1-mediated PMN immune response in
BM-PCa. Aim 3. Delineate the therapeutic potential of dual TβR1/AR regulation for improving mCRPC
therapeutic outcomes. Primary Objective: To develop a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for treating BM-PCa
by enhancing PMN anti-tumor response and overcoming PCa resistance to ADT. Study Design: For Aim 1,
we will identify the impact of androgen signaling on PMN polarization ex vivo (using patient-derived PMNs and
mouse bone marrow PMNs) and in vivo using normal PCa, non-metastatic and bone metastatic PCa cells) and
in vivo (using mouse intratibial bone metastasis models). For Aim 2, we will delineate the role of TβR1 in PMN
response to mCRPC using TβR1 knockout models. For Aim 3, we will define the therapeutic potential for using
combination BAT with a novel bone-targeted TβR1 inhibitor."
10897052,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is difficult to diagnose early in its disease course due to the
overlap in initial symptoms with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many individuals with DLB therefore
experience long delays in receiving an accurate diagnosis. This lack of sensitivity in the consensus
diagnosis for DLB, particularly outside of specialty-care centers, means that DLB is associated with
delayed interventions and increased caregiver burden. We thus propose a two-phase study that
investigates the utility of combining data from wearable sensors, ecological momentary assessments
(EMAs), and traditional measures as a multidomain approach for the early diagnosis of DLB. To
collect and analyze these integrated objective measurements, we will establish a research
infrastructure that includes an interdisciplinary team of engineers, clinicians, researchers, and
biotechnology companies.
 In the R21, we will estimate and compare the distributions of cognitive, motor, sleep, and
behavioral monitoring profiles in subjects with probable DLB (n=20) and AD dementia (n=30). If the
R21 demonstrates the feasibility of using wearable sensors and EMAs in this population and their
ability to improve discrimination between DLB and AD, we will proceed to the next study phase. The
R33 aims to characterize and compare the trajectories of these same traditional and novel cognitive,
motor, sleep, and behavioral monitoring profiles in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
one or more core DLB features (MCI-DLB; n=75) and in subjects with amnestic MCI and no core DLB
features (MCI-AD; n=25). We hypothesize that a composite measure combining information from the
baseline and trajectory measures in the longitudinal R33 will improve discrimination between
individuals with MCI-DLB who will convert to DLB, AD, or remain MCI.
 We anticipate that the results of this study will have tangible benefits to researchers, clinicians,
patients, and the caretakers of patients. The improved ability to differentiate early DLB from early AD
will assist researchers in selecting appropriate subjects for clinical trials of AD and related disorders
(ADRD; e.g., DLB). Moreover, because of the longitudinal nature of the R33, researchers and
clinicians will have accessible data on disease progression, which can be tremendously helpful in
evaluating the efficacy of treatment. Most importantly, by improving the diagnosis of early DLB,
clinicians will be better equipped to avoid prescribing potentially harmful treatments (e.g.,
antipsychotics for DLB) and to more accurately tailor current or future interventions to patients earlier
in their disease course at the time that such interventions are most likely to be effective."
10897105,"Chronic low back pain (LBP) and osteoarthritic (OA) joint pain are the most common causes of chronic
disabling pain and despite extensive investigation the pathophysiology of these conditions remains undefined
and there is considerable controversy regarding their clinical management. Clearly current hypotheses for the
progression of tissue injury to painful disability have not, short of removing the painful joint from the body,
generated effective and safe treatments. Our recent studies in the mouse tibia fracture model of complex
regional pain syndrome (CRPS) demonstrated that all CRPS patients expressed IgM autoantibodies with
pronociceptive passive transfer effects after intraplantar injection into the injured hindlimb or intrathecal
injection into muMT fracture mice lacking B cells and immunoglobulin, and these pronociceptive CRPS IgM
effects were mediated by C5a complement signaling and inflammatory cytokine release. Tibia fracture in mice
caused an increase of C5a receptor (C5aR) expressing macrophages in the fracture limb dermis and C5aR
expressing microglia in the corresponding spinal cord segments, and these activated immune cells release
pronociceptive inflammatory cytokines in response to C5a signaling. Moreover, after fracture in mice,
exaggerated neuropeptide and sympathetic adrenergic signaling stimulated pronociceptive IgM antibody
accumulation in the skin and spinal cord. These observations are potentially paradigm shifting. The central
hypothesis guiding our work is that tissue trauma causes neural activation of the innate and adaptive systems
of immunity, with localized neoantigen expression in the injured tissue and corresponding spinal cord
triggering lymph organ germinal center reactions characterized by the formation germinal B cells, with
subsequent pronociceptive immune complex deposition and complement activation supporting localized
chronic nociceptive sensitization. The primary objective of this proposal is to identify specific pharmacologic
targets for the successful treatment of LBP and OA. The specific aims are; 1) to identify the autoimmune
responses mediating nociceptive sensitization in the lumbar disc puncture (DP) mouse model of chronic LBP
and in the monosodium iodoacetate arthritis (MIA) mouse model of chronic OA knee pain, to determine the
prevalence of pronociceptive antibodies in LBP and OA patients, and to identify adaptive immune responses in
LBP patient spinal discs and OA patient joints, 2) to temporally map the formation of lymph node germinal
centers, characterized by the induction of T follicular helper cells (Tfh), germinal center B cells, and the
production of pronociceptive antibodies in the DP and MIA mouse models, and 3) to determine whether
sensory neuropeptide and sympathetic adrenergic signaling constitute a unifying mechanism for the activation
and maintenance of the immune response to tissue injury. These experiments potentially will establish a
rigorous foundation for exploring mechanisms of tissue injury induced autoimmunity, advance our
understanding of musculoskeletal pain, and identify specific targets for future clinical trials."

With the widespread use of combination antiretroviral agents, the incidence of HIV-associated nephropathy
(HIVAN) has dramatically decreased in the recent years. Yet, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD)
and end-stage kidney disease in patients living with HIV remains high, suggesting that HIV predisposes
patients to increased risk for chronic kidney disease. Indeed, several lines of evidence from recent
epidemiological and animal model studies indicate that concurrent HIV infection and age-related comorbidities,
such as diabetes mellitus, have a synergistic effect on the incidence of chronic kidney disease, thereby
necessitating an examination of mechanisms by which HIV infection even at low viral load accelerates the
progression of CKD. Among the HIV-1 viral proteins, we previously showed that HIV viral protein R (Vpr) can
induce cell cycle dysregulation, apoptosis, and polyploidy in renal tubular cells. However, the importance and
consequences of Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest and polyploidy has not been fully explored in the setting of
kidney disease. In this proposal, we will further dissect the mechanisms dictating the cell fates of Vpr-
expressing renal tubular using in vitro approaches (Aim 1). Similarly, using transgenic mice expressing Vpr in
renal tubular epithelial cells, we will characterize the cell cycle dysregulation and gene expression at single-cell
levels, and determine whether the pharmacological intervention of cell cycle dysregulation can attenuate
kidney disease progression in this model, as well as in HIVAN mouse model, Tg26 (Aim 2). To complement the
findings in Aims 1 and 2, we will assess the expression of genes and cell cycle regulators in kidney biopsy
samples of HIV+ CKD patients (Aim 3). We will also perform transcriptomic profiling for comparative analyses
with findings in murine kidneys. Our results will provide a better understanding of the underlying molecular
mechanisms by which chronic HIV infection accelerates the progression of CKD and a proof-of-concept for
novel target treatment for CKD in HIV patients."

The United States is at the forefront of the global obesity epidemic. To understand the mechanisms driving
increases in obesity, this first cycle of the R01-DK099039 project developed and validated a novel laboratory
model for overeating highly palatable (HP) foods in the context of HP food cue and stressful environments, both
of which are associated with weight gain and obesity risk. Findings supported that BMI-related adaptations in
cortisol, ghrelin, insulin sensitivity, HP food craving and hunger each predicted HP overeating in a Food Snack
Test (FST) in a laboratory experiment, and remarkably, these measures also prospectively predicted weight gain
over a longitudinal 2-year outcome period. Recent data suggests glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) modulates
stress biology along with its effects on metabolism. Preliminary work by led by Dr. Jastreboff indicate GLP-1
analogue (GLP-1a) treatment decreases craving, hunger and food intake in both the laboratory and real-world
setting. Thus, in this competitive renewal, we propose a multi-PI experimental therapeutics approach with the
GLP-1a, semaglutide, in the unique and predictive laboratory model developed in the current project to test the
hypothesis that GLP-1a treatment will attenuate HP food cue- and stress-induced food motivation and intake in
obesity and also improve metabolic and stress responses and such changes will predict weight outcomes. A
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week study with GLP-1a in men and women (N=96) with
obesity (BMI 30-39.9 kg/m2) is proposed to test the above overall hypothesis both in a laboratory experiment
and over a 12 -week treatment period to assess real-world outcomes. Specific aims are: 1) to examine the effects
of GLP-1a vs. PBO treatment on food craving, hunger, food-cue- and stress- induced FST intake and eating
topography in the FST; 2) to assess the effects of GLP-1a vs. PBO treatment on weekly food craving and food
calorie intake in the real-world setting during the 12-week treatment period; and 3) to examine the effects of
GLP-1a treatment on metabolic and stress responses (ghrelin, cortisol, and insulin resistance) on HP food
craving and intake in the experimental lab model of food craving and FST intake. Exploratory aims will GLP-1a
changes in laboratory outcomes predict weight outcomes and whether specific factors such as gender, chronic
stress, disordered eating, diet and physical activity affect outcomes. Utilizing a novel experimental therapeutics
approach, the next phase of this project will apply the current cycle’s validated laboratory model of identifying
processes underlying greater HP food craving, intake and weight gain to test mechanisms by which a GLP-1a
analogue exerts significant weight effects in obesity. Positive findings will not only inform how GLP-1a exerts
effects on weight, but also provide a unique, stress and food cue sensitive, innovative and cost-effective human
laboratory approach for testing novel therapeutics to decrease HP food craving, overeating and weight gain."

 Shigella causes bacillary dysentery with high worldwide morbidity and childhood mortality with complications
that include cognitive and developmental impairment in children suffering multiple diarrheal episodes each year.
Shigella’s main virulence factor is its type III secretion system (T3SS), which is used to deliver effector proteins
into host cells to promote pathogen entry. T3SSs are shared by many Gram negative pathogens with the
injectisome comprising a(n): 1) external needle and tip complex for delivering translocators and effectors; 2)
basal body that spans the bacterial envelope; and 3) cytoplasmic sorting platform (SP) that energizes and
controls secretion. We pioneered visualizing the SP by cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and since then we
and others have identified the components of the SP. We now propose studies to explore structural differences
between the “on” and “off” secretion states for the in situ injectisome with parallel biochemical analysis of the SP
sub-assemblies and the first visualization of the Shigella injectisome-host membrane interface in situ. We will
use cryo-ET methods to view the SP pods at a 1-nm or better resolution and then use biochemical and molecular
methods as we develop models of assembly and function. In our investigation of the SP, we will explore the
movement of protein domains at the SP interface with the inner membrane ring. In parallel, we will extend our
study to examine another important cytoplasmic component of the injectisome - the export gate nonamer formed
by MxiA, which undergoes structural rearrangements in the absence of the SP. We will also exploit a system
we’ve generated for trapping different secretion substrates within the in situ injectisome so that we can determine
how the overall structure compares for three different states. These are the “on” injectisome (ipaD null strain)
and two forms of “off” injectisomes (mxiH null strain and effector-blocked strains), which will provide functional
insight into SP and export gate communication and association. We propose three complementary aims: 1)
Define the makeup, intermediate states and structural requirements at the SP/inner-membrane ring (IR) interface
that allow SP assembly and guide type III secretion. 2) Correlate export gate structural features with secretion
status using complementary cryo-ET and molecular methods; and 3) Identify the structural changes associated
with trapping substrates within the in situ injectisome and begin generating the first high-resolution picture of the
injectisome-host membrane interface in situ using cryo-ET. Improved cryo-ET methods provide an
unprecedented view of substructures within the Shigella injectisome in situ to reveal elements that cannot be
studied using purified needle complexes and this is reflected in the preliminary data presented here. We can
now visualize these sub-structures, target them for molecular analysis and purify them for in vitro biochemical
and biophysical analysis. The T3SS is an essential virulence determinant for many pathogens, but we still lack
the structural understanding needed to determine the mechanisms that underlie type III secretion."
10888290,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Drug overdose is the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States, and more than 2 million
people in the United States are struggling with some form of opioid addiction (OA). Notably, many patients
with OA are first introduced to opioids with a prescription for treatment of acute and chronic pain. Health care
systems are also significantly impacted by the opioid epidemic, with opioid-related hospitalizations increasing
by 150% and emergency department visits for opioid-related treatment doubling over the past 20 to 30
years. Thus, the use of prescription and clinical data from existing health system records offers a powerful
opportunity to improve our understanding of opioid use and abuse. Several health systems with longitudinal
data on millions of patients have also created biobanks to facilitate electronic health record (EHR)-based
genomic research and implementation of genomic medicine. In 2007, the National Human Genome
Research Institute organized the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) network to develop
EHR algorithms for medical disorders, and this was expanded in 2018 to include psychiatric disorders
(PsycheMERGE). To date, however, EHR-based risk prediction and genomics have not been widely
leveraged for substance abuse research. Evidence suggests that substance use disorders are highly
heritable, although the underlying genetic risk factors remain unknown. In Project 1, we will leverage two
powerful health system biobanks to develop EHR opioid phenotypes using prescription records and clinical
diagnoses on more than 5 million people.
 We aim to (1) validate and harmonize case and control phenotypes across multiple disorders, (2)
complete genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of opioid use phenotypes and the largest GWAS of OA
to date, and (3) examine the interaction between genomics and brain structure in opioid-using patients.
Successful completion of these aims will represent a major advance in demonstrating the utility of EHR
resources for furthering our understanding of OA and will build a multi-site opioid research network for
continued scientific discovery. Integrating Project 1 in the broader context of the Integrative Omics Center for
Accelerating Neurobiological Understanding of Opioid Addiction (ICAN) creates multi-omic synergy that
extends the impact of achieving these aims, linking them directly to differential gene regulation (Project 2)
and experimental follow-up of key findings in rodent models (Project 3), as well as gene networks
identification (Project 4). In this way, other ICAN Projects will enhance interpretation of Project 1 findings,
and Project 1 GWAS and imaging results will provide opportunities to extend the other ICAN Projects,
collectively achieving our goal to identify biologically meaningful drivers of OA."
10888293,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The ongoing opioid epidemic is one of the most important public health crises of our time with overdose
fatalities quadrupling since 1999 and surpassing those of gun homicides in recent years. Given the individual
and societal burden of opioid dependence, it is necessary to characterize the biological pathways to
dependence that can be targeted for treatment and intervention. The work proposed in Project 2 combines
multi-omics resources to examine specific hypotheses regarding the functional brain architecture of opioid
addiction (OA). Guided by existing theory implicating the prefrontal cortex (PFC), nucleus accumbens (NAc),
and amygdala in the cycle of substance abuse, we propose to generate and combine existing data at
multiple omics levels in each brain region using postmortem human tissue collected from opioid overdose
cases and matched controls. The measurement approaches we use are genome-wide, in each of the
three brain regions and in each biological domain: single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), epigenome (DNA
methylation and histone acetylation), and transcript (via RNA-seq) in our combined sample (N=641) with
follow-up single-cell validation/replication.
 We will accomplish these goals across three aims. In Aim 1, in the existing combined sample, we will fill
out the brain regions not currently assessed in specific brain/regions or biological domains and perform
analyses to detect region-specific and general (across-brain regions) methylation, histone acetylation, and
gene expression differences between cases and controls. In addition, we will perform analyses aimed at
integrating across those biological domains. In Aim 2, we will perform single-cell follow-up of Aim 1 findings
to pinpoint all cell types within the PFC, NAc, and amygdala that drive the differences identified in Aim 1, with
validation by RNA-seq in fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) separated cells and RNA-FISH. In Aim
3, we will genotype samples where needed and perform genetic association mapping—histone modification,
DNA methylation, and gene expression QTL mapping—to identify genetic variants that account for the
regulatory differences observed between cases and controls in Aim 1. These QTL approaches will allow us
to identify regulatory differences with a genetic basis, versus those somatically acquired as a consequence
of chronic opiate use, exposure, or other environmental factors.
 Our overall goal is to create a framework in which we can map, in brain, the OA functional relevance of
genomic sets (genes, pathways, features) and generate results that can be leveraged in Project 1 and the
Synergy Core through mapOA, and in Project 3 through selected genes, targeted for functional validation in
vivo in the dlPFC and NAc using genetic engineering, viral vector injection, and pharmacology approaches in
mice. Through this synergy we will distinguish between predisposing and exposure consequent
dysregulation and move toward mechanistic understanding that can drive new treatments of OA."
10888295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The goal of Project 4 is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks that underlie opioid
addiction (OA) but are otherwise missed by traditional statistical approaches. To achieve this goal, we will
apply our multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to
identify OA-associated gene networks, by capitalizing on P50 data across human and rodent models. GNetII
includes genome-wide epistasis, explainable artificial intelligence, gene network construction, and lines-of-
evidence (LOE) methods. These cornerstone methods enable integration of multiple levels of individual-level
data, and we will specifically integrate large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in 220,722
living subjects from Project 1 and the Synergy Core, gene regulation data (RNA-sequencing, DNA
methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from multiple addiction-
relevant brain tissues (including prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala) from 641 OA case and
control decedents (deceased individuals) from Project 2, experimental mouse and rat model results from
Project 3, and additional public omics data.
 OA is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States, afflicting an
unprecedented number of U.S. adults and youth. OA is highly heritable (~54%). Yet, few genetic loci have
been conclusively identified for OA and related outcomes, and common genetic variant-based heritability
explains only 17% of the variance in OA. We hypothesize that epistasis (i.e., interaction of variants or genes)
contributes to the missing heritability. Applying big data science methods to large-scale GWAS, gene
regulation data in brain tissue, and cross-species data will reveal previously undetected relationships and add
knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Build OA-associated gene networks via genome-wide epistasis.
 Aim 2: Build multi-omics networks using postmortem human brain data.
 Aim 3: Integrate networks across species to find OA-associated gene networks with multiple LOE.
 Analyses will be performed on the powerful high performance computing architectures at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our
study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes and will help
explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the genetic loci that emerge from across the P50 and the
broader field."
10888332,"Project Summary/Abstract The overall objective of the MDSRC Training Core is to increase the number of rigorously trained and scientifically competent researchers capable of sustaining productive basic science, translational and/or clinical research programs in muscular dystrophy. To meet this central objective, the core will identify and recruit qualified basic science and clinical predoctoral and postdoctoral candidates who demonstrate a genuine interest in, and potential for, independent basic science, translational and/or clinical research in muscular dystrophy. Particular emphasis will be placed on the recruitment of trainees from underrepresented groups with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, socio-economic status and disabilities. The Training Core and associated matching funds will support at least three predoctoral trainees in MDSRC faculty labs at any one time, plus at least one postdoctoral trainee and one clinical trainee. The Training Cores at UF and UCLA will oversee and coordinate a spectrum of training activities for trainees supported by the core and matching funds, as well as the predoctoral, postdoctoral and clinical fellow researchers engaged in muscular dystrophy research in the labs of researchers supported through the projects of the MDSRC. Each trainee will prepare an Individual Development Plan, based on their past training and recommendations from their primary mentor and thesis committee. Depending on the career stage of the trainee, the individualized plan may consist of a structured didactic program, seminars, and mentored grant writing experiences. All predoctoral trainees will be required to enroll in courses at their respective institutions that cover muscle health and disease, grant writing and responsible conduct of research. Trainees in clinical research will further be required to enroll in courses related to the design and conduct of clinical trials. Both UF and UCLA offer specific courses on muscular dystrophies - Muscular Dystrophy and Myopathies at UF and Mechanisms and Therapies for Muscular Dystrophies at UCLA. The UCLA course is fully online and available to any student across the University of California system and beyond, and the UF course recording will be complete in Spring 2021, and made available to trainees across the three sites. The Training Cores will further enhance the training environment by supporting 1) annual trainee hosted seminars at UF and UCLA, 2) travel to attend the Annual NCH/OSU Myology Course and, for those attending the course, a trainee presentation evening for trainees from UF, UCLA and NU and, 3) travel to present at our Wellstone Center aligned New Directions in Muscle Biology and Disease (New Directions) international conference. In addition, the MDSRC Center will continue to organize two international conferences focused on muscle health and disease – the New Directions Conference, and Advances in Skeletal Muscle Biology in Health & Disease Conference. At the New Directions Conference, the Training Core will host a Trainee Data Blitz for trainees across the different Wellstone Centers to facilitate interactions and data sharing."
10897009,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For over 40 years, the Integrated Training Program in Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (DEM) has
supported and enhanced research training in DEM for predoctoral, postdoctoral, and short term summer
student trainees at the University of California, San Francisco. The predoctoral training path operates with the
UCSF Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, which trains students for research careers investigating basic
mechanisms of human physiology and disease, to integrate training and strengthen opportunities for graduate
students interested in research careers in DEM. The training program also includes a short-term summer
research program for medical students, helping to support interest in DEM-related fields early in education.
 Postoctoral training includes two tracks. Track 1 supports research training for physician-scientists, while
Track 2 supports mentored postdoctoral research training in DEM. All postdoctoral trainees may select to focus
on Basic or Clinical/Translational Research pathways. Both pathways provide a combination of didactic
(seminars, lectures, journal clubs) and individually-mentored research training. The DEM T32 Program also
works with the Training for Clinical Investigators programs at UCSF, including courses in Epidemiology,
Biostatistics, and Clinical Study Design. All predoctoral and postdoctoral DEM trainees participate in seminars
and practical application on the Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Science, and Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion.
 Trainees work with a large, accomplished, and interactive DEM faculty drawn from multiple academic
departments and Organized Research Units/Institutes across UCSF. All of the predoctoral trainees who earned
PhDs in the past 15 years have continued in scientific research positions -- in postdoctoral research
fellowships, academic research faculty positions, or pharmaceutical/biotech research positions. Of the
postdoctoral trainees who completed their fellowships in the same period, 41% hold academic faculty
positions, and 61% remain in research or research related careers. New improvements to the DEM Program
include a formal Career Mentoring Program, a new summer research program for medical students, an annual
retreat, increased integration with the UCSF Diabetes Center and NIH/NIDDK-supported Nutrition and Obesity
Center (NORC) and further expansion to the new basic and clinical science campus at UCSF Mission Bay.
 Together these changes enhance the already strong DEM Training Program and will expand future
opportunities in DEM for both predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees at UCSF."
10897010,"Project Summary/Abstract: Neurodegenerative illnesses such as Parkinson’s (PD), Lewy Body Dementia
(LBD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affect nearly 15% of adults over age 65 and are leading causes of death
in the US. While these illnesses are traditionally defined by their neurologic symptoms, more recent research
describes the high impact of other medical symptoms on patients and the immense psychosocial
consequences of these illnesses on both patients and families. Unfortunately, multiple lines of evidence
demonstrate that many of the needs most important to patients and caregivers (e.g. pain management,
advance care planning, end-of-life care) are poorly addressed under current care models. Palliative care is an
approach to caring for individuals with life-limiting illness that addresses potential causes of suffering including
physical symptoms, psychosocial issues and spiritual needs. To date there have been limited attempts to apply
these principles to neurodegenerative illnesses despite evidence that patients’ and caregivers’ unmet needs
may be amenable to this approach. Notably, the candidate has played a central role among a growing cadre of
academic centers that now offer palliative care services for neurodegenerative illnesses and presents results
from a randomized trial of academic-based outpatient palliative care that convincingly demonstrate this
approach improves patient and caregiver outcomes over current standards of care. While efficacy trials are
critical to forwarding this field, barriers to their dissemination include a limited workforce of palliative care
specialists, lack of palliative education amongst neurologists, lack of team-based resources in community
settings, and patient mobility/transportation issues. The long-term goal of the candidate is to improve outcomes
and raise standards of care for older adults affected by neurodegenerative illnesses through novel, efficient
and effective models of delivering palliative care. The Research Aims of this award will be met through: Study
1: Determine the effectiveness and feasibility of individual palliative care training for community neurologists
and team-based virtual house calls for PD/LBD patients and caregivers (funded R01); Study 2: Develop a
community-based model of palliative care for AD patients and caregivers (funded NIA AD Administrative
Supplement; R01 trial to stem from results); Study 3: Determine the effectiveness and feasibility of a novel
online community model to support community-based palliative care for PD/LBD (R01 Under Review); and
Study 4: Integrate geriatric principles and care into our neuropalliative care model to improve outcomes for
patients and caregivers affected by neurodegenerative illness (future P01 grant). As this is an emerging
research direction for the candidate, the Career Development Objectives will provide formal training in
academic leadership, geriatric palliative care, implementation science, caregiver support, telehealth and
healthcare policy. This proposal is significant because it will create a foundation for palliative care
dissemination efforts relevant to neurodegenerative illness and the broader field of geriatric palliative care."
10898087,"Project Summary/Abstract
Between 18% and 56% of patients with cancer misuse opioids. Opioid misuse can result in worse healthcare
outcomes, such as neurotoxicity, infection, and compromised immune functioning. Further, it predisposes
patients to developing substance use disorder (SUD). People living with cancer have multiple risk factors for
developing SUD and face unique prevention and risk management issues. Anxiety and depression (i.e.,
psychological suffering) that drive avoidant coping increase SUD risk in patients with cancer. While specific
psychological risk factors for opioid misuse have been identified, no interventions targeting these factors
currently exist to reduce SUD risk in this population. Uncoupling psychological suffering and opioid misuse
represents an opportunity to reduce SUD risk and better enable individuals with cancer to use their opioids as
prescribed. The framework of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) appears ideally suited for this
problem. Since substance use interventions are most effective when tailored to populations, patients would be
best served through an intervention specifically designed for individuals with cancer on opioid therapy. This study
seeks to: (1) refine a behavioral intervention targeting SUD risk and psychological suffering in individuals with
cancer; (2) pilot test the tailored intervention for this population; and (3) estimate effect sizes for an adequately-
powered RCT. Dr. Yusufov’s career goal is to leverage her background in health behavior risks to conduct
patient-oriented research that addresses psychological suffering and substance use in individuals with cancer.
The integrated training and research plans proposed in this revised application will provide Dr. Yusufov with
advanced training in several critical areas needed to enhance her program of research toward this career goal.
With mentorship and guidance from national leaders in palliative care, psychosocial oncology, substance use,
patient engagement methods, and ACT, the training is targeted to the following domains: (1) research in palliative
care (Dr. James Tulsky), (2) SUD treatment (Dr. Kathryn McHugh), (3) development/testing of psychosocial
interventions, patient-oriented research, and patient engagement methods (Dr. Joseph Greer), (4) clinical
research in palliative care/psychosocial oncology (Dr. William Pirl), and (5) adaptation of ACT interventions (Dr.
Kristy Dalrymple). These training objectives will be achieved through a combination of didactic/applied activities
in a Stage I behavioral trial involving pilot testing. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School
provide an outstanding environment for these training and research objectives, including clinics supportive of
patient-oriented research, seminars/courses in designated training areas, and a highly active Clinical and
Translational Science Center with a wide array of resources for career development and training. This K08 award
will provide an essential bridge between Dr. Yusufov’s prior training and experience and her career goal of
becoming an independent scientist conducting patient-oriented research to reduce the public health burden of
SUD risk in cancer settings by targeting underlying psychological suffering."
10930975,"Project Summary/Abstract
Breast and ovarian cancer are among the most common cancers in women worldwide.PARP inhibitors have
shown potential for the treatment of BRCA-linked cancer, via a synthetic lethality mechanism that exploits the
HR defect. However, tumors often develop resistance to these and other drugs. Therefore, there is a pressing
need to find new, targeted treatments for BRCA-linked cancer. Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer cells
and a potential source of tumorigenesis. A major cause of genomic instability is replication fork stalling at sites
of DNA damage or abnormal DNA structure. A limitation in the study of mammalian stalled fork repair has been
a dearth of tools with which to analyze this process in molecular detail. The Scully lab solved this problem by
adapting the Escherichia coli Tus/Ter replication fork barrier (RFB) to induce site-specific replication fork
stalling on a mammalian chromosome.
Tandem duplications (TDs) in primary cells lacking BRCA1 are induced specifically by a Tus/Ter block but not
by a conventional double strand break (DSB), indicating specificity for the stalled fork response. Intriguingly,
breast and ovarian cancers lacking BRCA1 similarly acquire large numbers of small (~10 kb) TDs, which we
have termed “Group 1” TD. Thus, the Tus/Ter system recapitulates the BRCA1-specific regulation of
Group 1 TD formation observed in human breast and ovarian cancer. I found that the stalled fork motor
protein—FANCM (product of the Fanconi anemia [FA] group M gene) acts synergistically with BRCA1 to
suppress Tus/Ter-induced TDs. Further, I discovered a novel synthetic lethal interaction between Brca1
and Fancm loss in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and in breast and ovarian cancer cells. These findings
suggest that FANCM may be a promising therapeutic target in BRCA1-linked breast and ovarian cancer.
My goals in this proposal are to delineate the novel FANCM-BRCA1 synthetic lethal interaction in cancer cells
and to determine the mechanism of synthetic lethality (Aim1). Further, I will explore the chromatin environment
and protein dynamics at the stalled fork and will study how alterations in these processes contribute to the
FANCM-BRCA1 synthetic lethal interaction (Aim2). I observe an epistatic role of Fancm and its downstream
target Fancd2 at Tus/Ter in promoting error free repair and suppressing error-prone repair.This critical role of
Fancm and Fancd2 in repair pathway choice at stalled forks raises the possibility that they might share similar
genetic interactions with Brca1. will identify how individual domains of FANCD2 function in repair pathway
choice at stalled forks and their genetic interaction with Brca1 (Aim 3). This holistic approach will provide a full
picture of the mechanism of FANCM-BRCA1 synthetic lethal interactions and might identify in FANCD2 a new
synthetic lethal target for cancer therapy.

Cells and tissues are mechanosensitive. Many
and
tissues, including the liver, are subjected to mechanical stresses
deformed over multiple time and length scales; these can both be altered in disease and drive disease.We
have used in vitro experimentation and theory to show that tissue mechanics are an emergent property,
arising from and requiring three components: the complex fibrous network of the extracellular matrix (ECM), the
cells within that network, and the forces applied to the combined system. Our work in the three years of the past
project period has specifically examined the microarchitecture and features of complex fibrous networks, the role
of cytoplasmic inclusions and cytoskeletal networks on cell mechanics, and the impact of viscoelasticity on cell
and tissue behavior. Collectively, this work has resulted in the development of a multi-axial model of a tissue.
Notably, however, while significant strides have been made in understanding tissue elasticity, viscous dissipation
and plasticity have been little studied, and the relationship between mechanics and structure – to the point that
one can be predicted from the other – remains poorly understood.
The overall goal in this competing renewal proposal is to demonstrate the in vivo applicability and predictive
value of the concepts we have defined. Specifically, we propose to determine the contribution of the individual
components of tissues to emergent tissue mechanics and the impact of these mechanics on cell behavior. Our
model tissue in this proposal, as in previous project periods, is the normal, fibrotic, and cirrhotic liver. although
our findings will be generally applicable to other organs in the body.
We hypothesize that tissue mechanics including viscous dissipation can be described and predicted by
integrating the features of the ECM fibrous network, the cells, and the applied forces. There are three specific
aims: 1) to determine the relationships between matrix structure and viscous dissipation, elasticity, and plasticity
in normal and diseased tissue; 2) to determine the impact of cell properties and cell-matrix organization on tissue
mechanics, particularly viscosity; and 3) to measure tissue solid stress and interstitial fluid pressure in normal
and diseased tissue and to define the impact of these forces on tissue mechanics, including dissipation. These
specific aims will use experimentation and theory as well as machine learning approaches to predict the
relationship between structure and mechanics, guide interventions, and generate a unified and therapeutically-
targetable model of tissue mechanics in disease.
We have previously identified many of the design principles underlying tissue mechanics. In the proposed work,
we will further define the critical components of the three elements underlying tissue mechanics, asking whether
we can predict mechanics (and their effects on cells and metabolism) from structure. This proposal thus has the
potential to answer fundamental questions in tissue mechanics, and to suggest approaches to manipulating
mechanics in clinically-relevant ways."
10898069,"Physical frailty, characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors, and cognitive impairment, ranging from mild impairment to dementia, often co-occur in older adults. Both are associated with considerable adverse health outcomes, high healthcare costs, and substantial caregiver burden, and highly prevalent in U.S. community-dwelling older adults. However, for older adults receiving long-term care in nursing homes, data is scarce on the prevalence of the two conditions over their stay. Community-based studies suggest heterogeneous clinical presentation of physical frailty, which may have implications for its management. It is unknown if such heterogeneity is similar in older nursing home residents and if it is influenced by cognitive impairment. Further, physical frailty and cognitive impairment share risk factors and predict future onset of one another but the mechanism of this complex interplay remains unclear. Lastly, depression is strongly correlated with both conditions, yet findings regarding the impact of antidepressants on the progression of physical frailty and cognitive impairment are inconsistent. This proposed F99/K00 project seeks to address these gaps by two specific aims with population longitudinal data and advanced statistical methods. Aim 1 (dissertation research) focuses on older nursing home residents and will describe the prevalence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment; identify subgroups of physical frailty and examine the variation of subgroups by cognitive impairment levels; and delineate the developmental trajectories of physical frailty and cognitive impairment and examine the correlations between trajectories. Aim 2 (post-doctoral research) expands to older adults in the community and will assess the reciprocal association between physical frailty and cognitive impairment; quantify the impact of cumulative exposure to antidepressants on trajectories of physical frailty, cognitive impairment and depressive symptoms; and examine the effect of depressive symptoms as a mediator of physical frailty on cognitive impairment with causal mediation analysis. Methodological innovations include the use of latent class analysis, group-based trajectory models, structural equation models (autoregressive cross-lagged panel analysis; autoregressive latent trajectory model), and causal mediation. This proposal is directly relevant to the growing aging population in the U.S., including those residing in the nursing homes and those living in the community, since it uses the national nursing home database Minimum Data Set 3.0 (Aim 1) and the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study linked to Medicare Part D Drug Event Files and the Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (Aim 2). This project will shed light on the concurrent progression of age-related physical and cognitive conditions. Results will inform future work to develop diagnostic tools and prediction models to facilitate timely identification of older adults at risk for accelerated functional decline, and implement care tailored to older adults’ needs to effectively delay the onset of negative health outcomes, enhance quality of life, and foster a healthy longevity."
10898072,"ABSTRACT
 Schizophrenia (SZ) is a common and severe psychiatric disorder. There is emerging evidence that
multiple structural and functional brain abnormalities develop early in the illness and outcomes can improve
significantly with early intervention as opposed to reversal of morbidity. However, all currently available
antipsychotics are effective on similar pathways; treatment failure is common and patients frequently suffer from
side effects. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify new biological mechanisms that contribute to the
pathology early in the illness and to develop novel treatments targeting these processes.
 Integrity of the high energy phosphate (HEP) metabolism is essential for providing energy required by
myriad neuronal functions, including neurotransmission and plasticity -processes implicated in SZ pathology.
While ATP is the primary energy source, creatine kinase (CK) enzyme reaction plays a central role in maintaining
stable ATP concentrations by creating a HEP pool as PCr, and generating ATP from PCr during increased energy
demand. Recent studies show abnormalities in several bioenergetic mechanisms in psychotic disorders,
including reductions in CK rate at rest. However, CK has not been studied during neuronal activation in psychotic
disorders.
 Identifying mediators of brain energy abnormalities will allow novel treatment approaches. Sleep, and
specifically slow wave sleep (SWS), has a restorative role in brain energy homeostasis, and EEG power density
at the slow wave frequency (slow wave activity, SWA) is the measure associated with the improvements in
energy measures. SZ is characterized by pervasive sleep disturbances, including in the first episode (FE), and
there is evidence for specific SWS deficits. However, the association of sleep characteristics and brain energy
metabolism in this disorder has not been studied.
 Given this background, we propose to study the activity of CK enzyme during neuronal activation in
patients with FE non-affective psychosis, and identify the role of reduced overnight accumulation of SWA in
explaining CK modulation. For this purpose, we will collect overnight polysomnography data and use in vivo
phosphorus magnetization transfer.
 Candidate is a psychiatrist with a background in neuroimaging research in psychotic disorders. Training
objectives for this grant are for the candidate to gain 1. Training in sleep research; 2. Advanced training in
cell biology and biochemical aspects of brain function; 3. Advanced training in statistics; 4. Training in
data presentation and grant writing skills. These goals will be accomplished by mentorship, formal
coursework, and the help of an exceptionally-qualified team of advisors and collaborators. The successful
completion of this career development plan will assist the candidate in making the transition to an independent
investigator with R01 level funding."

The Midwest D-CFAR seeks to advance impactful HIV research and thereby catalyze greater effectiveness in
the HIV response in our region and beyond. More than ever, the scientific progress required to make
progress against the HIV pandemic requires a diverse and cross-disciplinary scientific workforce, novel trans-
disciplinary insights and deep engagement with communities and stakeholders. The epidemic in the St. Louis
and Missouri Region is in urgent need of such progress: the total annual number of new cases
(approximately 500), deaths (approximately 200) and hospitalizations has remained steady over the last five
years, even as these numbers have fallen in some areas in the US. At this moment, however, the region has
unique opportunities: the End the HIV Epidemic Initiative has energized the response and mobilized
resources. At the same time the NIH HIV funded research base at WU and SLU has grown from $8.2 to
$14.8 million yearly, generating renewed scientific insights into cure, treatment and care delivery. In this
environment, an investment from the NIH in a Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR) can
accelerate existing scientific investments and align scientific directions with the broader HIV response. After a
formative process to identify strengths and gaps in our environment, we have assembled a stakeholder-
engaged and data-driven proposal. We propose the D-CFAR to be jointly hosted by Washington University in
St. Louis (WashU) and Saint Louis University (SLU) to synergize complementary strengths. We include an
optional core in Dissemination and Implementation Science, which reflect our institutional strengths and
regional needs. We are led by a distinctive and diverse MPI team, Drs. Geng (WashU) and Iwelunmor (SLU),
to draw a wide range of scientific expertise and institutional units together. Our specific aims are: Aim 1.
Attract, advance, and retain HIV investigators to accelerate the scientific response to HIV regionally and
globally. Aim 2. Develop and deploy institutional resources to promote multi-disciplinary, innovative research
for an effective and equitable HIV response. Aim 3. Foster engagement with communities and regional public
health authorities to ensure stakeholder-responsive research and rapid utilization of findings into practice.
Aim 4. Undertake iterative evaluation of D-CFAR based on standard process evaluation as well as the
Translational Sciences Benefits Model to prepare for a full CFAR application long-term impact. Our vision is
to equitably improve the lives of people affected by the HIV epidemic. Our mission is to augment the scope,
quality, and impact of people-centered science addressing HIV. Our goal is to transform our institutions to
lead science aligned with the OAR priorities and contribute to turning the tide on this epidemic. In summary,
the Midwest D-CFAR will provide scientific leadership, build infrastructure dedicated to HIV research to
enable collaboration, and establish a rigorous framework to develop the next generation of scientific leaders
in HIV research, and thereby contribute to turning the tide on the HIV epidemic in our region and beyond."
10898384,"Project Summary Administrative Core (AC)
The Greater Saint Louis (STL) region and Missouri face a critical turning point in their response to the HIV
epidemic, grappling with approximately 500 new HIV diagnoses and 200 deaths each year, with half of these
occurring in STL. Factors such as poverty, housing issues, co-infections, and drug use exacerbate the
situation, while limited public health investments impede progress, with only 65% of diagnosed individuals
achieving suppression and insufficient PrEP usage. However, there is newfound momentum to combat the
epidemic, as Missouri is among the prioritized ""End the HIV Epidemic"" states, receiving increased attention
and funding. Washington University in St. Louis (WashU) and Saint Louis University (SLU) can play a crucial
role in advancing the scientific response to HIV. Over the past five years, our HIV funded research has grown
by 80%, and a dedicated group of young researchers and emerging investigators are ready to drive scientific
advancements, engage institutional and community stakeholders, and elevate science's role in our response.
To capitalize on existing resources and enhance the HIV response, we aim to secure an NIH investment for a
Midwest Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR). The Administrative Core (AC) will serve as the
central hub of this D-CFAR, ensuring efficient operations, leading stakeholder engagement, and overseeing
monitoring, evaluation, and strategic planning. The AC will be co-led by experienced HIV researchers, Drs.
Geng (WashU) and Iwelunmor (SLU), bridging perspectives from both institutions and ensuring mutual
contributions and benefits. The MPIs have a proven track record of collaboration and a plan for shared
leadership. The AC will effectively implement the Center's objectives by coordinating with other cores and the
Internal Advisory Committee (IAC). The Stakeholder and Community Advisory Committee (SAC) will provide
governance and align the D-CFAR with regional and NIH priorities. The AC's specific aims are to provide
leadership and management for advancing HIV/AIDS research through agile methods, engage regional
stakeholders to align D-CFAR activities with local efforts, and conduct rapid evaluations to ensure effective
implementation and optimal impact, guided by the Translational Science Benefits Model (TSBM). With a robust
administrative infrastructure, the AC will ensure rigorous and efficient communication, operations, engagement,
and evaluation. Serving as the ""nerve center"" of efforts to improve HIV research and leverage regional
endeavors, the AC will play a vital role in the D-CFAR's contribution to ending the HIV epidemic in the Greater
Saint Louis region and Missouri."
10898385,"Project Summary Developmental Core (DC)
The D-CFAR Developmental Core will establish a centralized mechanism to provide mentoring, training, and
supplemental funding to enlarge, strengthen, and diversify the cadre of HIV investigators in St. Louis, the
Missouri region and beyond. To achieve this vision, the Developmental Core (DC) led by Drs. Fred
Ssewamala, Patricia Cavazos and Richard Grucza, will design and deliver critical resources through
leveraging our existing strengths and filling critical gaps. In Aim 1, we will create a structured mentoring
program that focuses systematic and personalized attention on emerging HIV investigators. We will prioritize
tailoring existing developmental resources in our environment, many funded via the Clinical Translational
Sciences Award (to WU and partner institutions including SLU). We will tailor these existing resources to the
needs of HIV investigators. We will also create new and targeted activities to fill gaps (e.g., consultation for
HIV researchers). We will guide utilization by creating a community of emerging investigators through a HIV
works-in-progress (H-IP) group that will provide structured expertise as well as peer-to-peer learning. Overall,
we will create a system that reflects contemporary “sociological” views on mentoring, which see a trainee in
relation to an ecosystem of resources in which one or more mentors play important, but not exclusive roles, in
growth. In Aim 2, we will strengthen the quality and culture of mentorship related to HIV research. We will
establish a three-component “mentor-the-mentor” training program including a Leadership Development in HIV
Workshop, mentorship attendance at the annual inter-CFAR meeting, and a “Mentoring Symposium in HIV”
seminar that will include an invited speaker and awards for mentoring as well as mentored research. In Aim 3,
we will provide supplemental support and funding to facilitate growth of emerging HIV investigators conducting
interdisciplinary research. Supplemental funding will support translational and transdisciplinary development of
investigators, help span traditional environmental silos both within academia and between academia and
regional community public health stakeholders. Together these activities will form a critical pillar of the D-
CFAR, and enlarge our network, advance scientific response to HIV, and turn the tide on the epidemic in St.
Louis, greater Missouri and beyond."
10898386,"Project Summary Advanced Technology Core (ATC)
As part of the Midwest D-CFAR, the Advanced Technology Core (ATC) will develop, support, and enhance the
impact of basic and translational HIV investigators to accelerate progress in priority areas of HIV research and
translate research discoveries into improvements in human health. The research enterprise at Washington
University (WashU) and Saint Louis University (SLU) is an enormous asset to our growing HIV-investigator
community. WashU and SLU received $658.1 million in funding from the National Institutes of Health in 2022.
They have a wealth of state-of-the-art core services and a large group of highly trained, highly successful
investigators working in disciplines that intersect HIV priority areas, such as microbial pathogenesis,
immunology, neuroscience, and inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases. Our outstanding HIV
basic and translational scientists are poised for growth, and the ATC will leverage the scientific resources at
WashU/SLU and bring together experienced and early-career HIV-focused researchers and non-HIV
investigators to drive innovative discovery and translation. The ATC will be led by accomplished basic and
translational science investigators and institutional leaders, Drs. Liang Shan and George Kyei. The ATC will
contribute to the overall D-CFAR objectives through the establishment of three new units: the Consultation
Service Unit (CSU), the Virology Research Unit (VRU), and the Technology Accessibility Unit (TAU).
These units will: (1) provide consultation services to foster mentorship and collaborative, multidisciplinary HIV-
focused basic research on HIV reservoirs, cure strategy, and HIV-associated comorbidities and coinfections,
(2) provide training, reagents, and experimental services for basic and translational HIV research, and (3)
provide cost-effective access to state-of-the-art technology in sequencing, imaging, immunophenotyping, and
drug discovery. Emerging HIV investigators will be eligible for preferred rates, pilot funds, and microgrants to
access cutting-edge technology and ATC services. In addition, we will enhance basic and translational
research by providing researchers with access to highly experienced investigators conducting translational
research and clinical trials, thereby promoting the development and optimization of novel interventions. Finally,
by engaging the sizeable non-HIV-focused research base, the ATC will bring new ideas and approaches to
studies focused on HIV cure and HIV-associated comorbidities and coinfections. In summary, the ATC will
reduce roadblocks and expand the reach of HIV investigation at WashU and SLU to contribute to the end of
the HIV epidemic."
10898387,"Project Summary Clinical Science Core (CSC)
The Midwest D-CFAR Clinical Science Core (CSC) is committed to addressing the persistent clinical
challenges posed by HIV and its related conditions. Despite significant progress in combating clinical AIDS
through antiretroviral therapy, HIV-related conditions – especially syndemic factors like mental health issues,
drug use, and unstable housing – continue to impact the epidemic in Missouri. Additionally, as the HIV-positive
population ages, comorbid clinical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, mental
health, and impaired cognitive function contribute significantly to healthy life-years lost. To tackle these
complex issues, the CSC aims to support creative and interdisciplinary investigator-initiated clinical scientific
projects. The Washington University and Saint Louis University collaborative environment is conducive to this
effort, boasting a rising class of energetic clinical researchers seeking NIH funding and a rich environment for
HIV clinical research with substantial annual funding. However, the existing infrastructure has not been fully
leveraged for investigator-initiated research. To address these gaps, the CSC plans to use infrastructural
funding from a D-CFAR to foster synergies, increase the number of investigator-initiated trials, and expand
clinical research into HIV-related comorbid conditions. Their specific objectives are: Aim 1. Provide
streamlined training, consultation, and support for foundational clinical research practices, including study
coordination, protocol development, ethical and regulatory approval, and access to clinical trial unit facilities.
By leveraging their expertise in clinical trials and successful enrollment of diverse populations, the CSC seeks
to support a growing cadre of innovative and interdisciplinary clinical research projects. Aim 2. Offer key
resources and support throughout the research process, from idea generation to pilot funding applications, with
a focus on accelerating interdisciplinary research addressing HIV comorbidities and co-occurring conditions.
Through events like Transdisciplinary HIV Studios and coordination of pilot data collection, the CSC aims to
facilitate cross-disciplinary scientific dialogue and maximize the utilization of existing clinical research
infrastructure. Aim 3. Provide specialized resources in analytical, biostatistical, data management, and
geospatial analysis for clinical research in HIV. To address the unique analytical needs of HIV-related
research, the CSC will offer a one-stop-shop for consulting services and specialized training sessions for junior
investigators. The CSC will bring together new collaborators and novel ways of thinking about issues relevant
to addressing the ongoing epidemic, improving care for long-term consequences of living with HIV, particularly
in underrepresented populations, and identifying and evaluating strategies to address HIV treatment,
prevention, and cure."
10898388,"Project Summary Dissemination and Implementation Science Core (DISC)
Despite significant progress in combating HIV, the epidemic remains a formidable challenge both globally and
locally in Missouri, with steady numbers of new HIV diagnoses and deaths each year. To address this ongoing
issue, the Midwest Developmental Center for AIDS Research (D-CFAR) proposes the establishment of a
Dissemination and Implementation Science Core (DISC). The DISC aims to leverage dissemination and
implementation (D&I) science to optimize the use of evidence-based interventions and advance the adoption
and sustainability of HIV interventions, guidelines, and programs. Three primary reasons for the need of this
core are: the region faces entrenched challenges to implementation, Missouri's designation as an End the HIV
Epidemic (EHE) focus area has mobilized resources and momentum, and the presence of world-class D&I
research resources that need tailoring for regional HIV research and public health communities. The DISC
outlines four specific aims: Aim 1. Supplement D&I resources by customizing existing assets to applied HIV
investigators. The core will add HIV-specific content to existing D&I resources, making the field more
accessible to investigators and addressing real-life HIV response scenarios, such as testing and linkage. Aim
2. Provide consultation to support both established and emerging HIV investigators in incorporating D&I
perspectives and methods into their research. Expert guidance will be offered on crucial D&I concepts, and
investigator-centered discussions will aid in utilizing available D&I resources effectively. Aim 3. Enhance
engagement between academic investigators and non-academic stakeholders in the Missouri EHE response.
Through participatory activities and innovation challenges, the core aims to foster collaboration between
academics and practitioners to address EHE priorities in Missouri. Aim 4. Evaluate the impact of DISC
activities using established evaluation frameworks. The evaluation will assess the reach, effectiveness,
adoption, implementation, and maintenance of DISC-wide activities, including scientific productivity and
additional D&I science priorities. The DISC is expected to magnify investments in the existing funded research
base and enhance HIV research efforts at Washington University and Saint Louis University. By supporting
investigators and strengthening academic-practitioner engagement, the core aims to make significant strides in
HIV prevention and treatment, ultimately contributing to the end of the HIV epidemic in St. Louis and Missouri."
10897855,"ABSTRACT
The American Heart Association estimates that, in 2022, about 720,000 Americans will have a first coronary
event and 335,000 will have a recurrent event, of which, approximately 87% are ischemic (thrombotic). Anti-
thrombotic therapy reduces the risk of recurrent ischemic events at the cost of a greater incidence of bleeding
complications. Patients at low thrombotic/ischemic risk should benefit from shortened treatment whereas patients
at high thrombotic/ischemic risk should derive greater absolute benefit from longer term treatment with more
powerful antiplatelet therapy. Currently available tools such as clinical risk scores and platelet function testing
are inadequate to effectively individualize cardiovascular care, and effective precision medicine strategies to
enable clinicians to target patients with high residual risk are lacking. Platelet function tests effectively identify
patients at risk but failed when used in trials designed to guide treatment. Key weaknesses of platelet function
tests include that they demonstrate substantial intra-individual variability, are influenced by both assay conditions
as well as the treatment of the patient, and that they measure platelet reactivity in response to a select agonist
or group of agonists. To address this gap in patient care, Prolocor identified a biomarker, FcγRIIa, on the surface
of platelets. When platelets activate, FcγRIIa amplifies platelet activation. Thus, increased platelet FcγRIIa
increases platelet reactivity and leverages the prognostic implications of platelet function tests. Compared to
currently available platelet function tests, expression of FcγRIIa shows less intra-individual variability, is
substantially less sensitive to perturbations related to assay conditions, and predicts increased platelet reactivity
in response to a variety of agonists. In a preliminary study of 197 patients, Cox regression analysis demonstrated
that platelet expression of FcγRIIa was the sole covariate (hazard ratio 3.9, p=0.035) associated with an
increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death when age, diabetes, and prior revascularization were included
as covariates. Thus, quantifying platelet FcγRIIa expression is a novel method to identify cardiovascular risk and
should serve as a powerful precision medicine tool. Prolocor has since refined the assay by developing
antibodies that bind to FcyRIIa on the surface of platelets that have been fixed with formaldehyde. Initial analytic
testing has demonstrated excellent precision (coefficient of variation of repeated tests <5%). The Proposed SBIR
is designed to provide comprehensive analytic validation of the assay in accordance with FDA Quality System
Regulation, demonstrating that the measurement of platelet FcɣRIIa expression is accurate, precise, and
reproducible. The analytic validation will be paired with clinical validation provided by prospective observational
studies in acute coronary syndrome, stroke and cancer. The combination of the analytic and clinical validation
will enable Prolocor to submit an FDA application for the Prolocor diagnostic tool, and allow for the uptake of
FcγRIIa to the field of cardiovascular medicine as a diagnostic tool for assessing cardiovascular risk."

The over-arching goal of the current program is to unify the training in substance use disorder research at
Rutgers Piscataway/New Brunswick encompassing the existing strengths in basic and human imaging
research. The result is the Rutgers Training Program in Addiction Research (TARP), which aims to recruit a
diverse group of outstanding predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers and provide them with rigorous and
comprehensive training in interdisciplinary addiction-focused research. The goal is for all trainees to gain an
appreciation of addiction neuroscience research from cells to circuits to behavior. Our faculty members
represent an extraordinary range of addiction research expertise, from epigenetics to human imaging. The
thirteen participating mentors, who together hold over $10 million dollars in annual active research support,
have decades of collective experience training dozens of students and fellows who have gone on to successful
careers in academia, industry and government. More senior program mentors include Drs. Gary Aston-Jones,
Danielle Dick, Zhiping Pang and David Zald. The program director, Dr. Chris Pierce, initiated and co-directed a
NIDA-funded translational addiction training program (pre- and postdocs) for over nine years at the University
of Pennsylvania before he moved to Rutgers in early 2020. The proposed predoctoral and postdoctoral training
programs are integrated through events, programs and courses designed to foster interactions among trainees
as well as the Rutgers addiction research community as a whole. These joint activities satisfy many of the
goals of the program including practice communicating research findings, instruction in contemporary addiction
neuroscience research, grant writing, critiquing the addiction neuroscience research literature, networking,
leadership, career development, etc. All training activities also emphasize ethical conduct of research and the
importance of scientific rigor and reproducibility. Although the research and didactic aspects of the Rutgers
TARP are neuroscience focused (basic science and human imaging) we also strive to give our trainees a
better understanding of the totality of the field including the challenges associated with developing treatments
for substance use disorders. Our over-arching goal is to better equip the next generation of addiction
neuroscience researchers to apply novel and innovative approaches to develop new therapies, which are
needed now perhaps more than ever."

10895969,"ABSTRACT
 Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in pregnancy pose a risk for perinatal transmission of the
virus to neonates, and HSV infections in the newborns are associated with severe morbidity and mortality. A
standard treatment of HSV infections with nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir does not eliminate
asymptomatic viral shedding and is ineffective against acyclovir-resistant HSV strains. Amenamevir and
pritelivir, the helicase-primase inhibitors, represent novel antiherpesviral medications that were developed to
circumvent the limitations of the nucleoside analogs. Both novel drugs completed Phase II clinical trials in
treatment of genital herpes in men and nonpregnant women and demonstrated superiority over placebo and
standard treatments. While amenamevir is currently indicated for the treatment of herpes zoster in Japan,
pritelivir received an FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation and has entered a Phase III clinical trial.
Pregnant women infected with genital herpes could benefit from amenamevir and pritelivir in suppressive or
episodic treatments to prevent the transmission of HSV to neonates. The first step to determine the potential
use of the novel drugs in pregnancy is to obtain preclinical data on their placental biodisposition.
The focus of the proposed investigation is to determine the biodisposition of amenamevir and pritelivir by
human placenta using ex vivo and in vitro experimental models. Meanwhile, assessing fetal safety for
amenamevir and pritelivir, as well as their effect on placental function, is imperative in clinical development of
these novel drugs for their potential use in pregnancy. While existing data from toxicity studies in animal
models suggest a favorable reproductive and developmental safety profile for amenamevir, assessment of
potential developmental hazards of pritelivir remains to be conducted. The specific aims are to
 1) Determine the extent of bidirectional transfer of amenamevir and pritelivir across term human placenta
 ex vivo, the distribution of these drugs in the placental tissue and maternal and fetal circuits, and their
 effect on placental viability and functional parameters;
 2) Determine the role of placental efflux membrane transporters in the placental disposition of amenamevir
 and pritelivir; and
 3) Determine potential embryo-fetal developmental toxicity of pritelivir in mice.
 This work will provide the preclinical data needed to determine potential use of amenamevir and pritelivir in
the treatment of newly acquired and reactivated genital herpes in pregnancy as well as in HSV suppressive
therapy during pregnancy. Amenamevir and pritelivir could be effective alternative treatments to manage
genital herpes in pregnancy to reduce the risk of mother-to-neonate HSV transmission in women with
asymptomatic presentation of genital herpes at the time of delivery and for those with inadequate response to
standard treatment with nucleoside analogs."

 1. Aims and hypotheses
This is a resubmission of our last year's CRCNS proposal, which received good and very good scores from
reviewers. Reviewers were excited about the general neuro-computational approach that builds on the
complementary skills of the PIs. In this revision, we address the reviewers' requests for clearer descriptions
of the planed experiments and analyses. Importantly, our new proposal has direct relevance for clinical
practice. By leveraging ideas from computational psychiatry [1–4] and from the Research Domain Criteria
(RDoC; e.g., [5, 6]), we aim to apply our neuro-computational approach to improve the understanding of
core social deficits shared by many pervasive neuro-psychiatric disorders. The general goal of this proposal
is to establish comprehensive—and clinically relevant—neuro-computational models of aberrant learning
in social contexts via behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments.
 Learning about others is crucial for successful social interactions [7]. Social interactions strongly
predict wellbeing [8]. Different types of impairments in social functioning accompany a variety of clinical
conditions and constitute core symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) [9–11] and Personality
Disorders with a Borderline pattern qualifier (BPD) [12–16]. We harness our neuro-computational approach
to investigate how social knowledge structures shape—and in turn are shaped by—learning about others.
The mechanisms underlying knowledge representations and learning that we propose in our computational
modeling approach are not “social” per se and we deem it a strength that they can be applied to learning
across various (non-)social domains.
 Here, we focus on social learning to specify commonalities and differences between healthy
individuals and individuals with marked social deficits associated with ASD or BPD. While these two
clinical groups probably both employ overly rigid social knowledge structures, they exhibit different types
of malfunctioning: ASD are characterized by under-mentalizing, i.e., insufficient inferences about mental
states of others—possibly due to poor or unspecific social knowledge[17–19]. In contrast, BPD show over-
mentalizing and overly negative interpretations of others' personality or intentions[12, 13]. Our novel
neuro-computational framework can improve the understanding social malfunctioning along dimensional
and categorical psychiatric criteria of ASD and BPD.
 We aim to test and refine computational models that formalize adequate strategies for acquiring
and employing social knowledge structures during learning. Our models offer normative perspectives on
social learning by specifying how ideal agents could learn in our controlled but ecologically valid tasks.
Thereby, we can quantify how much humans—particularly clinical populations characterized by pervasive
social deficits—deviate from computationally specified “optimal” benchmark strategies. In conjunction,
this project aims to reveal the neural computations underlying the representation of social knowledge
structures and their flexible deployment during learning. The project addresses three specific aims:"

The proper function of cells depends on an enormous number of interactions between different proteins.
Interactions that are weak and transient are especially important in controlling molecular events that are rapid
and dynamic. In many cases these transient interactions are mediated by three-dimensionally folded protein
domains in one partner protein that bind to short peptide sequences in the other partner. These peptide
sequences are known as Short Linear Motifs, or SLiMs, and among human proteins there are over 200 distinct
families of SLiM-binding domains and many hundreds of examples. SLiM-mediated interactions serve critical
roles in subcellular localization, assembly of dynamic multi-protein complexes, and substrate recognition by
post-translational modification enzymes such as kinases, phosphatases, ubiquitin ligases, etc. While some
examples have been studied intensively, for the vast majority of SLiM-binding domains the key sequence
features that govern recognition of their target motifs are poorly defined. Moreover, over 3 million residues of
the human proteome are predicted to be structurally disordered and hence are likely to contain many as-yet
undiscovered SLiMs. This proposal seeks to illuminate the molecular basis of SLiM-mediated interactions and
fill current knowledge gaps. The experiments will develop a method for rapid quantification of relative binding
strength for thousands of variant peptide motif sequences, and a systematic interrogation of SLiM sequence
features that control their recognition and potency. The approach will use an intracellular functional assay that
can define SLiM recognition rules for a wide variety of globular domains, provide a relative affinity ranking for
large numbers of candidate motif sequences, and even identify competitive inhibitor peptides that can inform
drug design. One goal will be to validate the methodology by establishing the correlation between functional
potency and biochemical affinity, and the dependence of SLiM residue preferences on the surrounding peptide
context or strength. These experiments will also seek to expand the range of binding affinities that can be
resolved by the method. Another goal will be to apply the method toward a large number of SLiM-binding
domains to characterize their sequence preferences and independently confirm large numbers of binding
peptides identified in separate screens. A third goal will be to develop additional adaptations of the method that
will allow for the design and optimization of peptide-based inhibitors and tethering molecules for linking
together distinct domains inside cells. Overall, these studies will contribute to our general understanding of
protein-protein interactions, with relevance to the mechanisms underlying normal cell function as well as
disease states including the hijacking of SLiM-binding domains by human pathogens."
10895976,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity prevalence has been steadily rising in the U.S. over the past three decades, including among pregnant
women, children, and minorities. Accumulating evidence links maternal obesity – particularly severe obesity –
to increased risk for obesity and other chronic diseases in their offspring. Moreover, intervention strategies
targeting the prenatal period have yielded disappointing results, shifting focus to the preconception period.
Utilization of bariatric surgery procedures have become more common, including among women of
childbearing age, as it achieves weight losses averaging between 20% and 30% of total body weight (roughly
3-4 times more effective than lifestyle interventions) and is sustained long-term (seven years and longer).
However, the risks and benefits of preconception weight loss by bariatric surgery to children are poorly
understood, particularly in the longer-term.
The overall goal of the proposed research is to determine if surgically-induced preconception weight loss can
reduce their offspring's long-term risk of obesity and obesity-related health. We will utilize information collected
from a large cohort (n=2120) of women with obesity who lost weight by bariatric surgery before becoming
pregnant and their children. We will compare weight and weight related health (size for gestational age, infant
weight gain, BMI through 6 years of age) in children of women who received bariatric surgery prior to
pregnancy to two control groups born to women who did not undergo bariatric surgery (n=21,200). The first
control group will be matched to the mother's pre-surgical BMI; the second control group will be matched to the
mother's pre-pregnancy BMI (after surgery). We will then determine the extent to which pregnancy conditions
(gestational diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disorders, anemia, gestational weight gain) mediate associations
between bariatric surgery and child outcomes. We will further examine if smaller size for gestational age – one
known risk following bariatric surgery – is associated with child outcomes similarly in children born to mothers
with and without bariatric surgery, and without and without pregnancy anemia.
Our large, unique dataset created by a consortium of Kaiser Permanente and Oregon Health & Science
University sites, will allow us to address these questions in a diverse study population, with representation of
racial and ethnic minority women at highest risk of severe obesity. Study findings will provide understanding of
the role of preconception weight loss on long-term child health outcomes, the specific influence of achieving
this weight loss by bariatric surgery on these outcomes, and guide future outcome studies that focus on
improving maternal preconception weight by lifestyle, medical, and surgical means."
10895982,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Only 56% of children with hearing loss (HL) in elementary school and only 44% in high school are reading at
grade-level (Geers et al., 2008). The literacy gap between children with HL and children with normal hearing
(NH) is observable early: preschoolers and kindergarteners with HL score significantly lower on early literacy
measures than children with NH (Easterbrooks et al., 2008; Nittrouer et al., 2012). Identifying the mechanisms
underlying emergent literacy in the preschool years for children with HL is therefore crucial to begin to close
the outcome gap. The long-term goal of this research program is to validate effective interventions for
preschool children with HL that close the early literacy gap between preschoolers with HL and NH. Initially, we
will identify the literacy acquisition mechanisms for children with HL and then build and validate interventions
that address the identified mechanisms. Toward this goal, the aims of the proposed research are to determine
the developmental influences between 1) phonological awareness and alphabetic knowledge, 2) phonological
awareness and receptive vocabulary, and 3) expressive morphology and receptive vocabulary for preschoolers
with HL. Children's emergent literacy skills will be assessed as they develop during preschool (Lonigan et al.,
2000). The obtained longitudinal data will be analyzed using latent change score modeling, useful for
identifying the developmental influences among co-developing constructs (McArdle, 2009). Latent change
score modeling in conjunction with longitudinal data will enable us to identify the developmental influences
among phonological awareness, alphabetic knowledge, receptive vocabulary, and expressive morphology for
children with HL. Identifying the unique developmental influences for children with HL relative to children with
NH will lead to an improvement of theoretical models of emergent literacy to account for the unique literacy
mechanisms of children with HL. Improved theoretical models will allow us to infer the malleable factors in
emergent literacy development for children with HL, leading to hypothesis-driven intervention creation and
improved clinical outcomes for this population."

The goal of this study is to identify effective approaches and implementation strategies to empower young
women at high risk for HIV in South Africa to utilize and persist on pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV
prevention during periods of elevated risk for HIV acquisition. PrEP uptake remains low among young women
and use by FSW and AGYW halves by 1 month and continues a sharp decline during the first 3-6 months;
effective strategies to target these critical periods are needed. The proposed study is embedded within TB HIV
Care’s large-scale existing PrEP delivery program for young women across 12 sites in South Africa. The
design leverages routinely collected data combined with strategic collection of de novo data and modifications
to the delivery of existing implementation strategies to inform effective PrEP scale-up. Specific Aim 1:
Measure ongoing PrEP implementation (e.g., acceptability, adoption, fidelity, cost) and identify implementation
strategies associated with PrEP uptake and sustained use. Approach: Assess ongoing program
implementation (e.g. direct observation methods, provider assessments, implementation logs) and conduct an
interrupted time-series analysis using existing, program data (2016-2020) and changes to PrEP adherence
interventions introduced over time (e.g. PrEP peer ambassadors, loyalty rewards program, etc.). These data
will be used to identify effective PrEP interventions within the program and to further refine PrEP
implementation strategies. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the relative effectiveness of modified PrEP
implementation strategies on increasing uptake and sustained PrEP adherence among marginalized
young women. 2a. Approach: Use a cluster randomized design to evaluate the content and reach of PrEP
social influence campaign, and its effect on PrEP uptake and persistence. 2b. Approach: Conduct a cluster
randomized trial focused on modifying implementation strategies of existing peer support interventions to
improve PrEP persistence, by varying the actor, intensity and duration of the implementation strategy. Relative
effectiveness of implementation strategies at achieving 1, 4 and 7-month adherence will be compared and
measured through programmatic PrEP refill data. Specific Aim 3: Identify a set of preferred PrEP
implementation strategies for young women based on the projected population-level HIV prevention
transmission modeling and cost-effectiveness analyses. Approach: We will extend, re-parameterize, and
analyze our previously validated deterministic mathematical model of heterosexual HIV transmission in
Southern Africa, which captures direct and indirect (spillover) prevention benefits of PrEP in the population of
interest (AGYW and FSW) and the wider population. This will quantify the population benefits (infections
inverted) of the PrEP implementation strategies and will include a full economic evaluation."

The overarching goal of this longstanding “Training Program in Basic Cancer Research” is to provide the
fundamental skills necessary for our trainees to succeed in outstanding careers in biomedical cancer
research. Toward that goal we provide them with superior training in the conduct of cutting edge
research, combined with a deep appreciation of the clinical challenges that doctors and patients face. To
achieve this goal, we have created a unique Training program, now entering its 45th year, entitled the
Training Program in Basic Cancer Research (TP-BCR). Support is requested for five postdoctoral
fellows, and three predoctoral fellows from the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine,
program in Biomedical Graduate Studies. Located at the heart of the University of Pennsylvania campus,
Wistar offers a superb research environment, recently rated “Exceptional” at the most recent CCSG
renewal in 2018. We have crafted a training program that combines unique sub-programs entitled “Bench
to Bedside Training” and a “Science Entrepreneurs” program, thus offering our trainees exposure to
clinicians and clinical problems in cancer research, unique insight into the business of science and
intellectual property, and a robust curriculum that includes workshops in teaching, writing, and grant
preparation. Our 26 faculty mentors tackle diverse questions in cancer, most have long-standing
successful training records, and all are well-funded, with an average of $890,000/year/mentor (DC). Our
current trainee pool consists of 79 trainees, which includes 24 predoctoral trainees (13 TGE) and 55
postdoctoral trainees (20 TGE). There is an average of four TGE applicants for each proffered slot, thus
allowing us to place the most highly qualified trainees in this program. All slots have been continuously
filled for the entire funding period, and our trainees continue to be highly productive, with 4.7 manuscripts
and 2 first author manuscripts per trainee averaged in the past three cycles, and 98% of our trainees
continuing in research-related or research-intensive careers. Taken together, this long-standing
program, which is the only T32 centered at The Wistar Institute, will provide the fundamental skills
necessary for our trainees to flourish in successful independent careers in cancer research."
10896028,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Periprosthetic infections is one of the most serious complications in orthopedic surgeries, occurring in 1-4% of
primary total joint replacement and up to 30% of revisions. Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S.
aureus), the most prevalent microbial culprit in orthopedic infections, are particularly hard to treat due to their
tendency to form biofilms on implant and notorious ability to invade the canalicular network of surrounding
bone. Existing prophylactic antibiotic deliveries involve high drug doses that are unsafe yet ineffective and
could lead to the development of drug resistance. Utilizing an oligonucleotide linker labile to S. aureus
micrococcal nuclease (MN) cleavage, we recently developed a hydrogel capable of on-demand release of
covalently tethered vancomycin. When applied as a hydrogel coating to Ti6Al4V intramedullary (IM) pin and
inserted to mouse femoral canal inoculated with S. aureus, the MN-triggered release of vancomycin timely
killed the bacterial on implant surface and within IM space before they had a chance to colonize or invade
surrounding bone, thereby preventing biofilm formation and osteomyelitis development in the 3 weeks
examined. The covalent tethering dose of vancomycin in this coating was orders of magnitude lower than the
typical prophylactic antibiotic content used clinically. The goal of the proposed study is to further engineer this
exciting on-demand drug release system to enhance its serum stability and rigorously examine its efficacy in
providing sustained protection against periprosthetic infections using two clinically relevant implant infection
models. In Aim 1, the oligonucleotide linker is chemically modified by selective 2'-O-methylation and
phosphorothioate modifications to achieved enhanced mammalian serum nuclease stability while maintaining
necessary sensitivity to MN cleavage. In Aim 2, the in vitro optimized nucleotide linker will be implemented in
MN-sensitive hydrogel coating and applied to Ti6Al4V IM pins for on-demand delivery of vancomycin. The
efficacy and safety of this prophylactic coating in providing timely and sustained protection against S. aureus
periprosthetic infections will be rigorously evaluated over 6 months using a rat femoral canal infection model. In
Aim 3, the efficacy of this on-demand antibiotic release strategy in reducing the high periprosthetic infection
rates following surgical debridement of previously infected rat femoral canal will be examined using a rat IM
implant revision surgery model. The degree of infections as a function of pin coating and bioluminescent S.
aureus inoculation are longitudinally monitored by bioluminescent imaging and µCT quantification of cortical
bone thickening at 2 weeks, 1, 2, 3 and 6 months, and by end-point quantification of bacteria on the retrieved
pin, torsion test of explanted femur and femoral histology at 1, 3 and 6 months. Long-term safety of the coating
is examined by systemic organ pathology at the endpoints. Systemic injections of vancomycin at a dose
several hundred-fold higher than that in the prophylactic coating are carried out in a subset of infected animals
receiving uncoated IM pins to allow direct comparison of the efficacy of this prophylactic coating vs. that of the
standard care. Achieving more sustained protection against periprosthetic infections or recurrent infections
than systemic vancomycin injections will be considered a success while achieving extended protection for 6
months without local and systemic side effects will be considered exceptional. If successfully validated, the
timely and sustained eradication of bacteria enabled by MN-triggered vancomycin release could bring together
safety and efficacy in addressing the daunting challenge of orthopedic implant-associated infections by
bypassing the notoriously hard-to-treat biofilms and osteomyelitis."
10893661,"ABSTRACT
Thyroid hormones play an important role in early development and growth, as well as adult phenotypes affecting
oxidative metabolism, cardiac output, energy balance, fertility, CNS function, and others. Complete absence of
thyroid hormone is incompatible with life. Thyroglobulin (Tg) is the precursor protein used in the biosynthesis of
thyroxine (T4) and tri-iodothyronine (T3). Tg is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of thyrocytes and
undergoes intracellular trafficking and secretion to the apical (extracellular) lumen of thyroid follicles, where it is
iodinated, triggering formation of T4 and T3. The function of thyrocytes is regulated by pituitary-derived Thyroid
Stimulating Hormone (TSH), which stimulates thyrocyte transcription and translation of hormonogenic genes, as
well as thyrocyte proliferation resulting in gland growth. Humans with biallelic TG mutation (and murine models)
have congenital hypothyroidism; in this disease, the mutant Tg protein misfolds in the ER and fails to undergo
anterograde trafficking in the secretory pathway, resulting in insufficient thyroid hormone synthesis with an
increase of circulating TSH. Additionally, misfolding of mutant Tg triggers severe ER stress, which is
accompanied by thyrocyte cell death (although growth can outpace death, favoring goiter development).
Notably, the dead thyrocytes are found in the apical follicle lumen. The finding of dead thyrocytes in the follicle
lumen either signifies cell death caused by the severe ER stress followed by extrusion into the apical lumen, or
hyperstimulation by TSH triggering cell growth into the follicle interior that exposes thyrocytes to an inhospitable
luminal environment, which causes cell death. In my F30 project, I will study homozygous TG-KO mice (created
via targeted gene disruption). My preliminary data indicate that the animals have severe hypothyroidism, yet
they survive to adulthood despite expressing no Tg mRNA (by qPCR) or Tg protein (by Western blotting). I seek
to address two general questions. First, since Tg is by far the most highly expressed thyroid secretory protein
of the ER, do the thyrocytes of TG-KO animals also experience thyrocyte cell death, and if so, does this involve
ER stress or occur independently of ER stress? The result of this question can help us understand the real
driving force behind the thyroid cell death observed in hypothyroid humans synthesizing mutant Tg. Second, as
some level of thyroid hormone synthesis is required for survival, how do animals lacking Tg protein make thyroid
hormone? Altogether, this project affords me significant educational opportunity, as I will develop the techniques
and tools of basic cell biology (ER stress analysis, proliferation and cell death analysis) with a deeper
understanding of the growth and function of the thyroid gland (a critical endocrine system), with clear clinical
implications."
10893858,"Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a life-threatening complication of Hirschsprung Disease
(HSCR), a common cause of intestinal obstruction in the newborn that results from incomplete development of
the enteric nervous system (ENS). HAEC affects 30-60% of infants with HSCR, occurs with unchanged incidence
pre- and post-operatively, and carries a mortality of 5-10%, with the majority of deaths occurring in newborns
prior to definitive operation. A critical barrier in the field is that the etiology of HAEC is poorly defined and current
treatment remains empiric (bowel rest, rectal washouts, broad-spectrum antibiotics) and directed toward
alleviating acute symptoms rather than targeting underlying pathophysiology. The long-term goal of our research
is to define the pathophysiology of HAEC in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches that reduce morbidity
and mortality in HSCR patients. Our preliminary and published findings, reinforced by those of other laboratories,
support the central hypothesis that perturbation of host-microbiome mutualism, including evasion of immune
exclusion and reinforcement of intestinal stasis by dysbiotic microbiota, drives the development of HAEC. Our
objectives are to 1) define the mechanisms for impaired IgA production and secretion in HAEC, 2) identify the
disease-promoting members of the dysbiotic HAEC microbiome, and 3) determine how the HAEC microbiome
reinforces intestinal stasis. The proposed research is innovative because it will utilize novel, preclinical models
to establish a causative relationship between dysbiosis and HAEC pathogenesis and test potential therapeutic
targets. Our group is uniquely qualified to complete the aims because of our expertise in HSCR & HAEC, host-
microbiome interactions, microbial endocrinology, and intestinal epithelial cell biology. The expected outcome of
these studies will be a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of HAEC and identification of novel
therapeutic approaches for prevention or treatment of HAEC."
10894347,"Project Summary
Over 300,000 new global cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) are reported each year, with a mortality
rate as high as 90%. Therefore, the development of effective antifungal treatments is of high medical significance.
The current antifungal arsenal consists of 3 core classes of drugs: the azoles, echinocandins and polyenes.
However, increasing antifungal resistance within Aspergilli (azoles and echinocandins) and secondary
cytotoxicity (polyenes) limits the treatment options. Consequently, there is a need for the development of
alternative treatment strategies to control IPA progression. Granulocyte transfusion therapy (GTX) has been
pursued as an alternative treatment strategy for microbial infections, but the short lifespan of primary human
neutrophils and insufficient donor supply has limited the use of this approach. Induced human pluripotent stem
cell (iPSC) derived neutrophils (iNeutrophils) can be produced in large quantities independent of a donor, are
genetically malleable to permit engineering, and may serve as invaluable replacement to primary neutrophils in
GTX. However, the efficacy of iNeutrophils in controlling fungal growth is currently unknown. Our lab and others
have recently discovered that deletion of GATA1 in iPSCs, a transcription factor that is important in eosinophil
and basophil differentiation, results in a highly homogenous culture of mature iNeutrophils that are more
phenotypically similar to primary human neutrophils than previously characterized wild-type (WT) iNeutrophils.
This puts us in a unique position to use iNeutrophils in both therapeutic and mechanistic studies to assess their
interactions with human fungal pathogens. This proposal will therefore leverage WT and GATA1-/- iNeutrophils in
combination therapy with current antifungals to inhibit the growth of clinically relevant Aspergilli, and to generate
host pattern recognition receptor (PRR) knockouts to characterize mechanisms of fungal recognition that drive
neutrophil antifungal activity. This proposal seeks to achieve these goals by combining in vitro immunology
techniques with iPSC and fungal genetics. Aim 1 will assess the ability of iNeutrophils to independently inhibit
the growth of isolates from the two most common causative agents of IPA, A. fumigatus and A. flavus. These
findings will then be expanded to assess the ability of iNeutrophils to synergize with current antifungals in vitro
to further enhance fungal killing. Aim 2 will then begin to dissect how neutrophils sense pathogenic fungi in their
environment by characterizing the receptor network needed to recognize the immunogenic polysaccharide
ß(1,3)-glucan in the fungal cell wall. This will be achieved by generating iNeutrophil ß(1,3)-glucan receptor
knockouts and by utilizing Aspergillus mutants with altered ß(1,3)-glucan exposure levels. Together, this
approach will provide essential training opportunities in stem cell engineering, immunology techniques, and
filamentous fungal genetics, while also providing important insights into the iNeutrophil/neutrophil antifungal
response."

Understanding the mechanisms involved in HIV acquisition and transmission is critical for novel prevention
strategies. The understanding of early events in HIV-1 acquisition and expansion of the virus remains
incomplete, especially in males. The incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STI’s) can increase HIV-1
acquisition risk, and there exist gaps in understanding the mechanisms also. This study will exploit the
medical male circumcision (MMC) roll out in South Africa, which facilitates the collection of otherwise
discarded foreskins to characterize male genital tissue-resident HIV-1 target cells. Dr Chigorimbo-Tsikiwa
will characterize the molecular and functional interactions between HIV-1 , lymphoid and myeloid target cells
from the FS. A uniqueness of the proposed study lies in interrogating how in vivo activating events from
bacterial STIs can modulate ex vivo HIV-1 target cell susceptibility. We hypothesize that foreskin tissue
contains several cell lineages that are susceptible to HIV-1 infection that can support viral expansion and
that the increased inflammatory response induced by asymptomatic STIs will exacerbate this susceptibility.
Aim 1 will investigate the phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles between lymphoid and myeloid cells
isolated from the foreskin tissues from men with and without asymptomatic bacterial STIs. Aim 2, will
determine the impact of immune activation on the susceptibility of lymphoid and myeloid cells to HIV-1
infection. Dr Chigorimbo-Tsikiwa will challenge foreskin-derived cells with a panel of HIV-1 isolates to
assess the relative susceptibility of characterized cells to HIV-1 infection. We will explore the impact of in
vivo immune activation by performing HIV-1 challenge on cells isolated from STI-positive individuals as well
as to in vitro activation using Chlamydia antigens, LPS and TLR agonists on viral infectivity and expansion.
Interferon stimulated genes, (ISG’s) antagonists have been shown to confer an antiviral state in cells and
against other retroviruses. Therefore, aim 3 will assess the repurposing of bis-arylidenecycloalkanones as
ISG agonist for use as anti -HIV-1 molecules in various cell models. This research study based from human
foreskins will provide novel insights in HIV acquisition and transmission in the male genital tract and
increase knowledge in the field which will facilitate the research career development of Dr Chigorimbo-
Tsikiwa. Dr Chigorimbo-Tsikiwa will receive mentorship from lead researchers who are prolific publishers,
possess several research grants in infectious disease biomedical research who have mentored
approximately 40 post-docs between them in Dr David Russell at Cornell University, Dr Frank Kirchhoff at
Ulm University in Germany and Dr Clive Gray in South Africa. This study will allow Dr Chigorimbo-Tsikiwa
access to high technology driven research in three continents afforded by her mentorship relationships
during this K award spring boarding her as an independent African HIV biomedical scientist."
10896082,"This is a multi-method, multiple cohort, RCT for an early childhood school-based intervention designed to
decrease multiple subtypes of aggression and peer victimization and facilitate social and emotional learning,
which has clear theoretical, educational, clinical, and policy implications. Based on rigorous prior theory and
research including extensive preliminary data, we propose to assess the impact of the Early Childhood
Friendship Project (ECFP) on changes in aggression/peer victimization subtypes, prosocial behavior, and
social and academic competence with a teacher-implemented (with coaching) version of the program. Further,
we will examine whether changes in executive functioning, emotion regulation, and hostile attribution biases
indirectly account for the program effects. We will test if physiological reactivity (skin conductance and
respiratory sinus arrhythmia) serves as moderators of intervention effects. Data will be collected from 600
children (30 randomly assigned preschool classrooms) diverse in SES and race/ethnicity. We will use multiple
methods (school-based observations, direct academic assessments, child interviews, physiological reactivity
using two tasks, observer, caregiver, and teacher reports) to assess the efficacy of the program, hypothesized
mechanisms, and role of physiology as a moderator of intervention effects. The duration of the effects will be
tested at both 4 month and 12-month follow-up and will thus demonstrate the impact the program has on
children’s school readiness and transition to kindergarten. The current proposal will use time intensive and
state-of-the-art techniques for assessing all constructs, which enhances the rigor of the approach. Investigating
the effects of a teacher-coaching model of the ECFP provides a critical next step in large-scale dissemination
of the program. Additionally, focusing on the role of physiological reactivity is a key goal for clinical child
research on the biological embedding of early adversity and its consequences prior to and after the transition
to school, which supports the innovation and impact of the proposal. Understanding these mechanisms
implicated in the efficacy of the program will enhance our understanding of how to foster wellness and school
readiness. The proposed project will provide a rich dataset with opportunities for secondary questions not
contingent on the efficacy of the ECFP as well as additional exploratory analyses related to functions of
aggression and bullying subtypes. The proposed project is well positioned to advance major “high-priority”
initiatives of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (Child
Development and Behavior Branch): Advancing research on the social, environmental, and biological factors
that impact adaptive behavior development and school functioning. In addition, this work is related to NICHD’s
“high-priority” research areas such as: psychosocial adjustment for individuals in high-risk environments and
school readiness skills in economically and socially disadvantaged children."

The overall goal of the proposed K43 Emerging Global Leader Award (non-clinical trials requirement) is to
support Dr. Njuguna’s research training to develop an independent career in HIV research. Dr. Njuguna is a
research scientist at the Kenyatta National Hospital, Nairobi, Kenya. The proposed work examines the unique
intersection between education and health in the context of adolescent HIV. Dr. Njuguna’s training goals are to
gain expertise in human centered design for intervention development, implementation science (IS), mixed
methods and adolescent research. This work will also provide an opportunity to work closely with policy makers,
and link clinical epidemiology skills she has previously acquired with real world IS methods. The proposal
leverages a multidisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators who will ultimately support Dr. Njuguna’s goal to
become a productive and influential independent investigator in adolescent HIV research.
The research goal of this proposal is to use a human centered design approach by utilizing mixed methods
research to gain an in-depth understanding of the school environment and its contribution to achieving treatment
goals, and to collaboratively and iteratively develop a school-based intervention to improve outcomes among
school-going adolescents living with HIV (ALWHIV). There is a growing population of ALWHIV surviving to
adulthood. These children need support to sustain medication use during adolescence and across school and
life transitions. There is limited evidence on school-based interventions to support treatment, despite the fact
that most ALWHIV are enrolled in school (including boarding schools). The Aims of this proposal are: 1.To
evaluate existing school-based structures available for ALWHIV and key determinants of caregiver and ALWHIV
school choice decisions, 2.To determine school-related correlates of viral suppression and retention in care, 3.To
develop and pilot a school staff training and peer support intervention in selected schools for non-health
outcomes (acceptability, feasibility and appropriateness).
This is the first study to our knowledge to propose to quantitatively characterize school-related correlates of
clinical outcomes in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) and evaluate factors influencing school choice for ALWHIV. The
study brings together a diverse team of stakeholders from the Kenyan national Education and Health sectors
and utilizes a multi-step approach to achieve study objectives. This approach will allow for rigorous intervention
development process, and pave way for a strong collaborative effort in a future R01 to test effectiveness of a
school-based intervention package to improve outcomes, including viral suppression, in school-going ALWHIV,
that could potentially benefit adolescents with other non-HIV chronic illnesses. Dr. Njuguna’s research goals
correspond with her training goals, and at the completion of this award, she will be in an excellent position to
submit an R01 application to further advance research in ALWHIV."

10896376,"SC1 PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The lifetime risk of atrial fibrillation increases with
advancing age and other risk factors that include obesity, smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Atrial
fibrillation is often a progressive condition, frequently beginning with brief episodes that progress to longer
episodes that do not terminate without either drug- or electrical shock induced cardioversion. The cost and
health burden of atrial fibrillation are expected to rise as the American population ages and the obesity rates
increase, thus highlighting the need for interventions and therapies that can slow the progression and reduce
the burden of atrial fibrillation. The overall goal of the Atrial Fibrillation Post-GWAS: Mechanisms to Treatment
PPG application is to translate AF genomic discoveries back to the bedside, focusing on genes to
mechanisms, genes to drugs, and interactions of genes with metabolism and environment. Our central
hypothesis is that increasing our knowledge about molecular mechanisms involved in genetic, metabolic and
structural changes in the atria will allow us to pinpoint possible targets for safer and more effective therapeutic
strategies. The Engineered Heart Tissue and Atrial Phenotyping Scientific Core 1 (SC1) will provide
support for all Projects in this PPG application via two aims. Aim 1 will maintain and propagate inducible
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), differentiate iPSCs to atrial- or ventricular-like cardiomyocytes (a-iCM, v-iCM),
from these create engineered heart tissues, and maintain atrial fibroblasts. Aim 2 will coordinate the contractile,
metabolic, and structural phenotyping of iCMs, EHTs, and mouse LA. SC1 provides unique access to human
a-iCMs, as well as a-EHTs that will enable all investigators on this PPG to achieve their scientific goals in a
coordinated and efficient manner. While we focus on a-iCMs and a-EHTs for most of the studies proposed in
the Program, we also support studies using v-iCMs and v-EHTs that will help differentiate atrial vs. ventricular
effects. Our experience with generating and maintaining human iCMs and EHTs provides an opportunity for
Projects within our PPG to use this leading-edge technology to test innovative hypotheses. Importantly, the use
of SC1 expertise for the phenotyping of these experimental models, including evaluation of contractile function,
mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial content, subcellular structure, and isolation of RNA ensures uniform
methodology across multiple models, through all projects, and makes these techniques available to individual
laboratories that were otherwise not feasible. SC1 eliminates duplication of effort and optimizes the use of
personnel, equipment, and supplies. The unique expertise provided by SC1 will support the goal of this PPG to
translate AF genomic discoveries back to the bedside."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and
stroke. Incidence of AF is further increasing due to the rise in obesity and age of the population, factors closely
related to AF risk and progression. Despite significant advances in AF diagnosis and management, treatment
and clinical outcomes remain poor and more than a decade has passed since the last AF drug discovery. The
overall goal of this PPG application is to use genetic/genomic findings to identify preventative and therapeutic
strategies for AF and develop them towards clinical application. Our central hypothesis is that increasing the
understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in genetic, metabolic and structural changes in the atria will
allow us to pinpoint possible targets for safer and more effective therapeutic strategies. Scientific Core 2
(SC2): Electrophysiology Core will support the overall goal of the PPG and test program hypotheses as
follows: Aim 1. Routine and reliable acquisition of ECG data for serial assessment of AF progression and
burden, Aim 2: Optical mapping of mice atria and engineered heart tissue (EHT) for linking cellular
pathophysiology with mechanisms of AF, Aim 3: Enzymatic isolation of mouse atrial myocytes for
electrophysiologic, ion channel and Ca2+ cycling studies. Collectively, the isolated myocyte studies combined
with optical mapping will provide important mechanistic links between cellular pathophysiology, AF in situ, and
the progresion of AF in serial ECGs. We will leverage the capabilities and expertise of this Core to allow
Project investigators to systematically integrate electrophysiological and cellular findings with genetic
observations. This allows an assessment of differences in susceptibility of the atria to metabolic or other
stressors that Projects will be studying as important contributors to AF initiation and progression. Importantly,
use of the Core for the acquisition and analysis of ECGs, optical mapping (mouse atria and EHTs), and
characterization of Ca2+, action potential, and ion channel dynamics in isolated myocytes ensures uniform
methodology that will strengthen the individual Projects of this PPG. Furthermore, metabolic dynamics
measured in an electrophysiological context herein, will complement the same measured in a metabolic
context (Scientific Core 1). This Core will provide in-depth intellectual input to support Projects with
experimental design, execution and coordination of experiments, and centralization for data gathering, thereby
promoting interaction and integration between Projects beyond merely providing a service. Finally, this core
eliminates duplication of effort and optimizes the use of personnel, equipment, and supplies, which enables all
Projects on this PPG to achieve their scientific goals in an organized and cost-efficient manner. In sum, the
services provide by this core to the Projects will help advance the understanding of the pathophysiology of AF,
thereby supporting the main goal of this PPG to identify preventive and therapeutic strategies for AF and
advance them towards clinical application."

Latinx children experience behavioral and physical health disparities early in development that persist into
adulthood. Early in development, Latinx children are behind their peers in cognitive self-regulation (e.g., poor
executive functions) and behavioral adjustment (e.g., low school readiness). It is not known how children’s
physiological stress regulation (PSR) relates to disparities in young Latinx children or how Latinx caregivers
can buffer their children from these negative outcomes. These are critical gaps in developmental science
because Latinx families face persistent, uncontrollable stress that can lead to chronic activation of stress
response systems that in turn, have negative cascading effects on behavior and biology. From a life course
perspective, identifying malleable risk and protective processes in Latinx families during the early childhood
years is critical for ensuring the long-term health and productivity of the large and growing U.S. Latinx
population. To address these serious research gaps, we use a novel cultural neurobiological approach to
prospectively examine culturally sensitive indicators of positive parenting and parents’ own physiological stress
regulation (PSR) as buffers of the link between child physiological stress regulation and critical developmental
outcomes in Latinx families. To increase the translational impact of the work we examine both cultural
stressors and strengths related to parenting in Latinx mothers and fathers. We specifically assess behavioral
and academic adjustment given that these developmental indices are at the forefront for young school age
children and difficulties in these domains can presage long-term outcomes. We follow children from the
preschool age into the kindergarten year because the former represents a critical time for the emergence of
stress regulation skills and the latter because the adjustment to the school setting represents a critical
developmental juncture. We put forth the following aims, which are directly in line with research
recommendations endorsed by NIH for advancing minority health and reducing health disparities: Aim 1:
Identify associations between PSR in Latinx preschoolers and behavioral and academic adjustment in
kindergarten; Aim 2: Examine positive parenting and parent PSR as moderators of the link between Latinx
preschoolers’ PSR and behavioral and academic adjustment; Aim 3: Identify contextual stressors that influence
Latinx parents’ positive parenting and PSR and cultural strengths that protect against these stressors. We use
a longitudinal design and a multimethod assessment (physiological assessments, behavioral observations,
self-report) of key constructs. The results of this project will provide critical data on how Latinx children’s PSR
is associated with later adjustment and identify malleable factors that can be leveraged into culturally informed
intervention programming to reduce disparities and improve the health and overall well-being of Latinx families."
10896174,"ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is one of the primary causes of intellectual disability in western nations,
with neurobehavioral hallmarks such as deficits in learning, memory and mood. We propose that developmental
ethanol (EtOH) exposure may induce long-lasting disruption of neural activity patterns during sleep which are
known to be important for memory consolidation and synaptic homeostasis. If so, this would create a situation
wherein the normal ability of the nervous system to repair and readjust itself during sleep would be impaired,
resulting in a daily insult to nervous system function long after the EtOH exposure ended. In support of this
hypothesis, during the past funding cycle we have demonstrated that developmental EtOH 1) disrupts and
fragments adult non-REM sleep, 2) the extent of sleep disruption in adults predicts cognitive impairment, 3) the
sleep impairment is associated with severe loss of parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) expressing
GABAergic interneurons which are known to contribute to sleep-wake architecture, 4) disruption of PV cell
function through neuropentraxin knock-out replicates some aspects of developmental ethanol but not sleep, and
5) preventing cell loss induced by developmental EtOH with LiCl prevents sleep, anatomical, and cognitive
impairments. In this renewal, we plan to further explore the mechanisms of developmental EtOH effects on sleep
and waking with cell specific analyses. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that selective optogenetic activation of
spared GABAergic neurons will restore the deficits in sleep and cognition induced by developmental EtOH in
transgenic mice (e.g., SST-Cre; Aim 1.1). In the same animals, we will correlate sleep-wake
function/dysfunction/repair with anatomical structure of several identified GABAergic circuits (e.g., SST, reelin,
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)) in sleep-related regions including basal forebrain nuclei, hippocampus and
neocortex. Data will include synaptic interactions of identified cell types using confocal and electron microscopy
as well as Golgi analyses (Aim 1.2). Performing the anatomical analyses on animals that we have assayed for
sleep/wake and cognitive function will allow us to directly relate structure (e.g., synaptic density) with
neurobehavioral function/dysfunction/repair (e.g., slow-wave activity, excitatory/inhibitory [E/I] balance). Aim 2.1
examines to what extent PV/SST cells are killed by developmental EtOH, or alternatively have down-regulated
phenotypic expression by tracking the fate of fluorescently labeled PV/SST neuron progenitors in Nkx2.1-Cre;Ai9
mice exposed to EtOH. This will provide information needed to guide attempts to restore GABAergic function
after EtOH exposure. Aim 2.2 will transplant PV/SST interneuron progenitors into EtOH treated mice, to examine
if re-populating GABAergic neurons in identified brain regions will restore sleep and/or cortical activity (e.g., slow-
wave activity, E/I balance), as well as sleep-related cognitive function and circuit structure. If successful, results
from this proposal could open a new window into both understanding and repair of early ethanol-induced neural
and cognitive impairment."
10867995,"Project Summary/Abstract
Access to reproductive healthcare in the U.S. has become increasingly constrained. Although a growing body
of research has focused on identifying state-level policies that affect women's access to care, less attention
has been paid to documenting access to reproductive healthcare at the local level. Understanding how
individuals actually experience access to care necessitates a finer-grained measure than the state level,
although no data currently exist that would allow for such an approach. Local access to reproductive
healthcare, including contraception, maternity care, and abortion, is a key structural factor that can hinder or
facilitate women's reproductive autonomy and maternal and infant health. Therefore, the primary goal of the
proposed project is to create a new comprehensive longitudinal (2009-2021) dataset that will allow us to
identify spatial variation in access to contraceptive, maternity, and abortion care at the U.S. county-level. We
will use the new dataset to identify “reproductive healthcare deserts” (RHD), or counties where access to
contraceptive, maternity, and abortion care is severely limited or nonexistent, document how access has
changed over time, identify disparities in access, and examine how such disparities shape health outcomes. To
create this unique dataset, we will integrate data sources on (a) access to publicly funded contraceptive care at
Title X clinics from the Office of Population Affairs and at Federally Qualified Health Centers from the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services; (b) access to maternity care from the Health Resources and Service
Administration; and (c) access to abortion care from the Myers Abortion Facility Database. We will also create
an interactive dashboard that will map the RHD dataset and include time-varying county-level
sociodemographic characteristics obtained from supplementary datasets (e.g., American Community Survey).
The dashboard will guide our descriptive research into the spatial patterns and scale of changes to
reproductive healthcare access over the study period and highlight disparities in access and their overlap with
sociodemographic traits. We will merge the RHD dataset with restricted-use data from the National Vital
Statistics System and the National Survey of Family Growth to develop spatially clustered multilevel models
analyzing the relationship between county-level reproductive healthcare access and individual-level measures
of maternal morbidity, infant health, interbirth intervals, contraceptive use, and unintended birth. Each of these
outcomes is tied to women's ability to time, space, and limit births and therefore likely to be affected by their
level of access to reproductive healthcare. Taken together, this project will provide a new comprehensive
measure of reproductive healthcare, a novel dataset and interactive dashboard that will track changes over a
13-year period, and robust evidence of how reproductive healthcare deserts are related to reproductive
autonomy and maternal and infant health."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects multiple organs, including lungs,
pancreas, intestine, liver, sweat glands, gallbladder, and the male genital tract. Airway infection and
inflammation currently cause most of the morbidity and mortality. Although several therapies have improved the
lives of patients, current treatments are inadequate and CF remains a lethal disease. Our knowledge about the
pathogenesis of the disease, its progression, and the state of the neonatal lung is inadequate. These gaps in
our knowledge have hindered attempts to develop better treatments and preventions for CF lung disease. A
major impediment to addressing these issues had been limitations of animal models. Although mouse strains
carrying null and missense CFTR mutations have made enormous contributions, CF mice do not develop the
airway or pancreatic disease typically found in humans. We have generated CF ferrets and pigs that replicate
many of the key features of human CF disease including intestinal obstruction, exocrine pancreatic destruction,
micro-gallbladder, vas deferens abnormalities, focal biliary cirrhosis, congenital airway structural abnormalities,
and airway and sinus infection with time. The goals of the Animal Models Core will be: (1) To provide Program
investigators with non-CF and CF ferrets and pigs so that they can successfully complete their project aims. (2)
To build new genetically engineered CF ferret models that express CFTR in a regulated fashion. (3) To assist
projects in carrying out small molecule delivery, the harvesting of biologic samples from live animals (e.g.,
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood, and microbiological samples), and the care and analysis of study animals.
(4) To assist projects in record keeping and coordinate animal usage among projects. The Animal Models Core
will function seamlessly through already established interactions with the Project Leaders, Pathology Core, In Vitro
Models and Cell Culture Core, and the Administrative Core. The success of the Animal Models Core is ensured
because of the commitment, experience, and expertise that the personnel bring to the Core."
10892138,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life limiting monogenetic disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The lung disease begins in early childhood and with time, airways
become permanently colonized by bacteria, inflammation becomes prominent, obstruction worsens, and ~95%
of patients die of respiratory failure. While significant advances have been made with small molecule modulator
therapies to restore function for some CFTR mutation classes, ~10% of people with CF have not benefited
from these strategies. The goal of these proposed studies is to apply the recent advancements in base
editing technology to correct CFTR mutations in somatic cells, with a focus on mutation classes that do not
respond to small molecule modulator therapies. We will investigate a new class of adenine base editors (ABE)
that converts A•T to G•C base pairs. Currently, there are 346 well characterized disease-causing variants of
CFTR, and of these, 66% are point mutations. Of all single nucleotide mutations, 46% are potentially
correctable using ABE. In this proposal, we will use ABE to modify the following 4 CFTR mutations: 1) R553X
and 2) W1282X are the 2nd and 3rd most common premature stop codon mutations. 3) 3849+10kb C>T is a
splicing mutation and represents ~12% of CFTR mutations. 4) G551D, the 3rd most common disease-causing
mutation, results in defective protein gating and is responsive to Ivacaftor treatment. Here we propose to: 1)
show that base editors will correct CFTR in CF cells and correct the anion transporter defect in vitro, 2) define
the cell type preferences of editing and the role of cell division in airway cells, and 3) correct the anion channel
defect in primary airway epithelia, as well as, critical disease phenotypes in the airways of a pig CF model.
 Projects 1, 2, and 3 (along with the valuable cores) work closely together to directly address the
Program’s goal of developing molecular therapies for CF. The Program effectively focuses a team of talented
laboratories to address a shared goal in a highly collaborative environment. Our track record supports our
commitment to improving the lives of people with CF and increasing our understanding of lung biology.
 Our goal is to provide a life-long gene repair strategy that could be adapted to for many CF causing
mutations. This proposed research is highly innovative. The reagents, methods, and data generated by these
experiments will provide guidance for base editing for other monogenic disorders, thereby significantly
advancing the gene therapy field."

10892140,"PROJECT 2
PROJECT SUMMARY
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) apical membrane anion channel. Loss of CFTR-
mediated HCO3- and Cl- secretion by airway epithelia impairs respiratory host defenses, causing bacterial
infection, inflammation, mucus accumulation, and respiratory failure. One strategy for restoring anion
channel function to the apical membrane is to increase the function of mutant CFTR channels. That has
proven successful for people with specific CFTR mutations. However, ~10% of people with CF have
mutations that do not respond to CFTR modulators or they are not able to take modulators. Another
strategy is to provide an alternative channel. Toward this end, we studied amphotericin B (AmB); earlier
work showed that AmB forms anion channels. We discovered that apical AmB increased HCO3- and
Cl- secretion in cultured CF airway epithelia, including those with CFTR-null mutations. AmB
increased ASL pH, height, and antibacterial activity. AmB is clinically approved to treat fungal infections,
and off-label lung aerosolization has an impressive safety record. Thus, AmB could potentially provide a
new mutation-agnostic therapy for CF lung disease. However, many questions remain unanswered and
we lack important in vivo data. Therefore, our overarching goal is to understand the mechanisms of
AmB-induced anion secretion in airway epithelia and to test the hypothesis that AmB can restore
CF host defenses in vivo. To achieve this goal, we will answer questions in three aims. Aim 1. What
molecular and cellular mechanisms elicit AmB-mediated anion secretion? Without cAMP-dependent
regulation and with half the anion selectivity of CFTR, AmB is an imperfect substitute for CFTR. We will
test key hypotheses about how AmB functions in airway epithelia. Aim 2. Which epithelial cells does
AmB target and how does AmB alter them? These studies will reveal AmB function in large and small
airway epithelia and diverse cell-types, test AmB in airway epithelia remodeled by inflammation, and test
for compensatory changes. Aim 3. Does AmB reverse CF host defense defects in vivo? Using CF pigs,
we will test if nebulized AmB increases ASL pH, increases ASL antimicrobial activity and height,
increases mucociliary transport, and enhances S. aureus eradication from the lungs. The results of
these studies will have direct implications for developing a new genotype agnostic approach to treating
CF, and will inform development of other therapies in Projects 1 and 3. Our proposal’s success is
enhanced by an ongoing collaboration between the labs of Welsh (Iowa) and Burke (Illinois), by
utilization of outstanding cores, and by an environment of cooperation between the Program’s projects
and investigators. With this background, our track record, and our commitment, we believe this research
can change the lives of people with CF."

10892143,"Project-3 Summary
Complexities in CFTR-expressing epithelial cells of the conducting human and mouse airway were recently
revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). These studies identified the ionocyte, an infrequent cell
type that expresses the majority of CFTR in the proximal airway and submucosal gland ducts. They also
showed that the repertoire of ion channels in the ionocyte is uniquely suited to potentially regulate airway pH.
However, whether only ionocytes contribute to innate immunity and clearance in the airways remains to be
determined; it is possible that other airway cell types, such as ciliated cells, express CFTR at levels that are
below the detection limits of scRNAseq yet are functionally important in the pathogenesis of CF lung disease.
Deeper knowledge of CFTR cellular physiology in the airway will greatly enhance our understanding of CF
pathogenesis, while also informing the cellular targets for gene therapy of CF lung disease. The proposed
project will focus on understanding the cellular functions of CFTR in ionocytes and ciliated cells, and whether
CFTR expression in each of these cell types is required or sufficient to prevent CF lung disease. Our
hypotheses will be tested in genetic ferret models, a species that more accurately reflects human CF lung
disease than mice. These studies are possible because of the creation of several new genetic ferret models
that can conditionally (in specific cell types) inactivate CFTR expression on a wild-type (WT) background or
reactivate CFTR expression on a CF background. Both of these strategies use CreERT2 technologies and
enable lineage tracing of the targeted cells in vivo using a fluorescent Cre-reporter. Additionally, we propose to
generate a new genetic ferret model in which CFTR is overexpressed specifically in ciliated cells, to test
whether high-level ectopic expression therein is sufficient to protect from CF lung disease. Key goals of this
project are to: 1) define the contributions of CFTR expression in ionocytes and ciliated cells to CF lung
pathogenesis, 2) determine the half-lives of ionocytes and ciliated cells in the CF and non-CF airway, and 3)
determine the extent to which CFTR expression in ionocytes and ciliated cells contributes to the regulation of
disease-relevant features of the airway surface liquid (ASL) (i.e. volume, antibacterial activity, chloride and
bicarbonate transport, and pH) and to mucociliary clearance. Each of these goals draws on the unique ability of
the Engelhardt laboratory to genetically engineer transgenic ferrets to temporally regulate CFTR expression in
specific cell types and to test these models for CF-relevant functional endpoints in vivo and in vitro. The
proposed study is the first to use state-of-art functional genetic approaches in a non-mouse species to tackle
difficult cell biology questions relating to CFTR function in the airway and CF lung pathogenesis. This research
is expected to significantly enhance the field's ability to develop effective genetic therapies for CF lung disease."
10892144,"Abstract – Clinical Practice Network
The Clinical Practice Network is the vehicle that will facilitate clinical intervention and data collection for the
Scalable TELeheaLth Cancer CARe (STELLAR) Center’s research program and then translate study findings
into comprehensive cancer care. The Center’s research program can be seen as filling gaps in knowledge
about how to optimize the cancer care sociotechnical system to deliver telehealth treatment for obesity,
physical inactivity, and tobacco use in cancer patients and cancer survivors in a manner that maximizes cancer
care access, quality, patient-clinician communication, and cancer treatment outcomes. The network will
leverage the same clinical practice network that we established for the population-based Lurie Cancer Center
Tobacco Cessation Program, which has been part of the NCI Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I) since
2018. Our practice network will comprise 11 hospitals across the 4 Northwestern Medicine (NM) Regions
(Central, North, Northwest, West). NM’s 52 oncology clinics are fully integrated by a single telehealth
infrastructure (Doximity), a single EHR-system (Epic), and a single, comprehensive, and integrhoated
repository of all clinical and research data (Enterprise Data Warehouse). The Clinical Practice Network
will implement and maintain the Center’s electronic and clinical infrastructure in close collaboration with the
Administrative and Research and Methods Core and with administrators, quality leaders, oncology clinical and
operations leads, and nurse navigators across NM. The Clinical Practice Network will include two working
groups to facilitate the implementation of STELLAR’s telehealth research program. The technical aspect of this
optimization will be carried out by the Infrastructure Workflow Team that will align Epic, the patient portal
(MyChart), and the wearable and app components of the system to support seamless integration of
technologies needed for STELLAR. The human aspect of the optimization will be carried out by a
Stakeholder/Clinical Workflow Team that will align treatment of cancer risk behaviors seamlessly into existing
workflows for cancer care delivery. Guided by the Policy Advisory Group and Internal Advisory Board, the
Clinical Practice Network will mount STELLAR Center’s Pilot Studies and Pragmatic Clinical Trial. These will,
in turn, provide a robust evidence base to drive the translation and the integration of sustainable telehealth
treatment of cancer risk behaviors across NM."
10892146,"Abstract - Pragmatic Clinical Trial
Cancer risk behaviors, including smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity, are individually associated with
reduced treatment response, side effects, heightened recurrence risk, decreased longevity, diminished quality
of life, and increased treatment cost for many cancers. These behaviors are at least as prevalent among
cancer patients and survivors as they are in healthy adults, but referral pathways to treat them are not routinely
integrated into cancer care. By integrating cancer risk behavior assessment into the electronic health record
system (EHR) and automating treatment referral, we plan to make telehealth-enabled treatment of health risk
behaviors (a clinical service called health promotion) accessible to cancer providers and patients throughout
the Center’s clinical practice network in a manner that is affordable, improves care quality, and is minimally
disruptive to existing clinical workflow. Our success in implementing patient-reported outcomes assessments
and EHR-supported smoking cessation, physical activity promotion, and obesity behavioral interventions
uniquely position us to integrate these services across the entire Northwestern Medicine (NM) oncology care
system using relatively few resources compared to in-person programs. We propose to build upon existing
NCI-funded tobacco cessation and symptom monitoring programs that are fully integrated into cancer by: 1)
adding brief screening for health risk behaviors, 2) augmenting the existing smoking auto-referral system to
include referral to a cancer-specific health promotion service that includes inactivity and obesity treatment; and
3) refining the symptom monitoring dashboard to include smoking, physical inactivity, and obesity. The Center
will deploy a 2-arm pragmatic clinical trial comparing a 12-month telehealth intervention for obesity, physical
inactivity, and tobacco use versus an enhanced usual care control condition. Participants (n=3000) will be
cancer survivors aged 18 or older who have at least one of the cancer risk factors. Treatment randomization
will be stratified by primary risk behavior, study site (Northwestern Memorial Hospital vs other NM hospital),
number of risk behaviors (1, 2 or 3), and cancer treatment (current treatment vs. not). Telehealth participants
will receive 20 calls or videos in English or Spanish, per patient preference, according to the following
schedule: weekly for 2 months, every other week for 4 months, monthly for 2 months, and every other month
for the final 4 months. Participants in the control arm will receive a pamphlet with local/national resources to
address their cancer risk behavior, which will be sent by either mail, email, or MyChart message depending on
patient preference. Assessments will be conducted by assessors, blinded to treatment arm, at baseline, 3, 6, 9,
and 12 months. We will evaluate treatment reach and its effects on the behaviors, care access and quality,
healthcare utilization, cost, patient-provider communication, and health outcomes, Findings from this rigorous
pragmatic study will be broadly applicable to diverse clinical settings and patient populations and contribute
substantially to the evidence-base for telehealth in cancer care, with potential to transform cancer care."
10897835,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chemotherapeutic agents are often dose limiting due to the emergence of a debilitating and painful
neuropathy, posing a major challenge to the successful treatment of cancer. Recent reports demonstrate that
male mice lacking T cells have prolonged mechanical hypersensitivity after treatment with paclitaxel (PTX),
and only the intravenous transfer of CD8+, but not CD4+, T cells reduced the hypersensitivity. Our preliminary
in vivo data demonstrates female mice have 2-fold more CD4+ T cells in the DRG than male and
ovariectomized (OVX) female mice, and neuronal injury induced by PTX robustly increases anti-inflammatory
CD4+ T cells in the DRG only in estrogen-competent female mice. CD4+ T cell depletion in female mice prior to
PTX results in an increase in mechanical hypersensitivity 3 days post-PTX. Our results suggest a previously
unexplored hormone and sex difference in CD4+ T cells and the severity of chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy (CIPN). PTX is primarily used to treat ovarian, breast, and non-small cell lung cancer with post-
menopausal patients at an increased risk of CIPN; therefore, preventative measures would be invaluable for
women. The mechanism by which CD4+ T cells reduce the severity of PIPN is unknown. In our preliminary
studies, DRG neurons from female mice have the capacity to activate CD4+ T cells to secrete anti-
inflammatory cytokines. Published RNA-seq datasets of DRG neurons show that DRG neurons express
MHCII, a protein directly involved in T cell activation. Our central hypothesis is that PTX administration in
female mice increases MHCII on sensory neurons to stimulate the paracrine release of anti-inflammatory
cytokines by resident CD4+ T cells to suppress CIPN. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which estrogen-
driven CD4+ T cells reduce the severity of PTX-induced peripheral neuropathy. Estrogen is known to induce
proliferation of blood CD4+ T cells, but it is unknown if this occurs in the DRG. We predict that estrogen
signaling in CD4+ T cells will increase the number of resident CD4+ T cells in the DRG to secrete anti-
inflammatory cytokines in response to PTX. We expect CD4+ T cells to ameliorate CIPN in female, but not
male mice. In Aim 2, we will quantify the extent PTX can enhance MHCII on DRG neurons to induce anti-
inflammatory CD4+ T cell cytokine production. We predict PTX-induced inflammation will increase neuronal
MHCII to elicit an anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cell response in the DRG of female, but not male mice. In Aim 3,
we will determine the degree in vivo activation of neuroprotective CD4+ T cells can reduce and reverse PTX-
induced peripheral neuropathy. We predict that activated CD4+ T cells will dampen and reverse CIPN in
female, but not male mice, unless pre-treated with estrogen. Completion of these aims will provide compelling
evidence that CD4+ T cells in the DRG of females are neuroprotective and anti-nociceptive, and can be
exploited to prevent or resolve CIPN. Neuronal MHCII-dependent activation of CD4+ T cells represents a novel
mechanism for neuro-immune communication that could be utilized for therapeutic intervention."

Enzymes are crucial biological catalysts that expedite challenging reactions across all domains
of life. While the development of structural biology methods over the past century has enabled
visualization of these fascinating systems, our understanding of the dynamic processes that
facilitate enzyme reactivity remains limited due to the timescales on which they occur. The
overarching goal in my research group is to develop and apply time-resolved methods capable of
visualizing these processes to elucidate the mechanisms of metal-containing enzymes important
for human health and medicine. Heme-dependent enzymes are of particular interest due to their
role in aerobic metabolism ranging from signal transduction, antibiotic biosynthesis and immune
response. Despite sharing similar structural motifs and catalytic intermediates, heme-dependent
enzymes are capable of catalyzing a wide range of reactions beyond their archetypal
hydroxylation outcomes. This project aims to investigate the structural features and dynamic
behavior that enables this atypical reactivity from dioxygenation to nitration and beyond. In
particular, we plan to repurpose biochemical tools capable of pausing turnover, such as
substrate/cofactor analogs and site-directed mutagenesis, as well as apply state-of-the-art time-
resolved methods that my group is currently developing, to visualize short-lived catalytic
intermediates via a combination of X-ray crystallographic and spectroscopic approaches.
Although applied to specific systems herein, the proposed methodologies may have utility in the
study of heme-enzymes more broadly, as well as other metalloenzymes. Likewise, the anticipated
results have the potential to impact both biocatalysis and the downstream development of
biotechnologies and therapeutics in the treatment of cancers and infectious diseases."

 Itchy skin conditions affect a substantial portion of the US population at annual costs exceeding $100
billion. Most types of chronic itch are poorly managed, establishing a compelling need to develop more
effective mechanisms-based treatments for these debilitating conditions. The present proposal will investigate
the role of neurons located in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) that express the receptor for substance P
(i.e., NK-1R) in descending modulation of itch, as well as the role of NK-1R-expressing neurons in the
superficial spinal and medullary dorsal horn in the ascending transmission of itch.
 The proposal has two overarching aims. Specific Aim 1 hypothesizes that NK-1R-expressing neurons,
and specifically ON-cells in the RVM (i.e., those that fire just prior to a noxious stimulus-evoked withdrawal
response), are critically involved in descending inhibition of spinal itch transmission. We will employ
chemogenetic and intracranial microinjection approaches to test if activation of NK-1R-expressing RVM
neurons suppresses acute pruritogen-evoked itch behavior, or manifestations of chronic itch (spontaneous and
touch-evoked scratching) in mouse models of psoriasis and atopic dermatitis itch. We will also investigate NK-
1R-mediated descending inhibition of spinal itch-transmitting neurons. Finally, we will record from
optogenetically identified NK-1R-expressing neurons in RVM and functionally establish if they are ON cells.
Specific Aim 2 hypothesizes that NK-1R-expressing neurons in the superficial spinal/ medullary dorsal horn
give rise to ascending projections to the somatosensory thalamus and parabrachial nucleus that are critically
involved in transmitting itch-related signals. We will use an optogenetic approach to determine if NK-1R-
expressing neurons in the spinal/medullary dorsal horn are activated by pruritogenic stimuli, and opto- and
chemogenetic approaches to investigate if the activation of such neurons elicits behavioral signs of itch (and/or
pain). A better understanding of central itch modulation and ascending sensory transmission has translational
significance for developing novel antipruritic treatments targeting NK-1 receptors to increase descending
inhibition of itch and reduce ascending itch-related signals.

Sleep is essential for optimal health and development. Poor sleep is associated with impaired functioning and
academic performance, and worse health outcomes in children. Latino children are disproportionately present
in urban settings, and due to their exposure to higher levels of urban and cultural stressors, are at greater risk
for poor sleep hygiene and quality. Over the past 3 years, we have demonstrated the acceptability, feasibility
and preliminary efficacy of a novel sleep hygiene intervention, SIESTA (School Intervention to Enhance Latino
Students’ Time Asleep) for improving sleep hygiene and sleep duration in urban Latino middle schoolers in two
geographic areas with a high proportion of urban Latino children at increased risk for poor sleep health:
Providence, Rhode Island, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. SIESTA involves 4 group sessions administered in
school to Latino middle schoolers (6th-8th grade) and two child-caregiver sessions administered remotely by a
bilingual (English/Spanish) trained facilitator from the community. The goal of this application is to administer
a two-site hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation design to evaluate SIESTA’s effects on a larger-scale-
for addressing Latino middle schooler’s sleep health, while also assessing implementation determinants. The
first aim of the proposed work is to evaluate SIESTA through a large-scale RCT with urban middle
school students in Providence, RI and San Juan, Puerto Rico. We will enroll 150 Latino children per site
(N=300), and randomly assign them either to the SIESTA intervention, or to the Sleep Education plus Child
Health attention-control condition (9 groups of each of the two conditions, per site; 8-9 students per group). We
will evaluate treatment effects on primary sleep outcomes such as sleep duration, efficiency and sleep onset
latency and on secondary sleep outcomes involving sleep hygiene behaviors, the sleep environment and
sleep-related disturbances and impairment. Assessments will occur prior to, immediately following, and at 4, 8,
and 12 months after the intervention. Over 1 year, we expect SIESTA participants will have improved sleep
outcomes, sleep hygiene behaviors and less sleep-related impairment than Controls. The second aim is to
identify implementation determinants and preliminary implementation outcomes of SIESTA to prepare
for future large-scale implementation in other urban school settings. We will conduct a mixed methods
process evaluation with input from community partners using the RE-AIM framework throughout and following
administration of the RCT. The proposed work builds on a 20-year collaboration between our research
teams in RI and PR, and an investment in advancing knowledge of multi-level factors affecting pediatric health
disparities in children through evidence-based, sustainable interventions. SIESTA has the potential to improve
sleep outcomes in urban Latino children and their daytime functioning, and to address a critical gap of the need
for tailored and effective sleep hygiene interventions for children at greater risk for poor sleep health."

Ubiquitination, the post-translational attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin chains, controls the stability, interaction
or activity of numerous key regulatory proteins in eukaryotic cells. Consequently, misregulation in protein
ubiquitination can result in various human diseases, such as metabolic disorders, cancers, muscle and nerve
degeneration. At the core of the ubiquitination process is the E3 ligase, which brings ubiquitin and the target
protein together, and enables the transfer of the ubiquitin to its target. My lab investigates the largest family of
E3 ligases, known as Cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). These enzymes are modular protein complexes, featuring a
common cullin scaffold and an interchangeable substrate receptor that recruits specific target proteins for CRL-
dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. Seven cullins (Cul1-7) exist in human cells, each of which
interacts with different sets of substrate receptors, yielding ~250 CRLs. We use a variety of approaches including
biochemistry, biophysics, molecular genetics, quantitative proteomics, and mathematical modeling to study how
CRLs work, how their activities are regulated, and what critical roles they play in cells and organisms. Given that
a large number of substrate receptors compete for access to the same cullin, our current research focus is to
uncover how the cellular repertoire of diverse CRLs is controlled to ensure ubiquitination of various CRL
substrates at the right time. Using Cul1 based CRL1, we previously reported that CRL1s constantly undergo
cycles of assembly and disassembly, which allows rapid recycling of Cul1 and timely formation of new CRLs
when their target proteins emerge and demand ubiquitination. A crucial player in this highly dynamic process is
Cand1, a protein exchange factor that promotes the exchange of substrate receptors associated with the same
Cul1 core. Eliminating the Cand1 activity leads to impaired degradation of CRL1 substrates in human cells and
severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. In this application, we ask, how are the dynamics of
other CRLs regulated? What role does Cand2, a homologue of Cand1 in human cells, play in regulating CRLs?
What advantage does this evolutionarily conserved dynamic exchange mechanism provide for the CRL system?
To answer these questions, we will use in vitro biophysical assays to quantify kinetic parameters for CRL and
Cand1/2 interactions. We will apply our updated quantitative immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assay to
characterize the impact of Cand1 and Cand2 on the cullin-associated proteome. We will employ genome-editing
techniques such as CRISPR to examine the biological role of Cand1/2, using cultured human cells and the model
plant Arabidopsis as our experimental systems. We will continue developing our mathematical model of CRL
assembly and activity, to help understand the CRL network in different cell types or under changing cellular
environment. Our efforts in understanding mechanisms regulating CRLs will help dissect the performance of
these E3 ligases in normal, diseased, and drug treated cells, providing novel insights for the prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases."

In patients under suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-1 persists in a latent state primarily in resting
CD4+ T cells. Both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies (nNAbs) targeting HIV-1 envelop protein can
mediate killing of infected cells through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) by natural killer (NK)
cells or antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) by macrophages and other phagocytes. Since ART
does not directly kill HIV-1-infected cells, antibodies can play an important role in elimination of the residual viral
reservoirs. Broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that could neutralize a wide spectrum of clinical HIV-
1 isolates brought new hope to HIV cure research. There is burgeoning evidence that the Fc fragment is
important to the antibody-mediated viral suppression. Moreover, the Fc fragment is indispensable for antibody-
mediated cell killing because of its engagement with Fc-receptors (FcR) on the innate effector cells. It is important
to evaluate antibody efficacy in tissues, especially in lymphoid tissues, because they are the major sites for HIV-
1 infection and are the most important anatomical reservoirs for HIV-1. The cell-killing functions of tissue innate
effector cells are critical to antibody therapeutic effects. We compared NK cells from human tonsils or lymph
nodes with those from peripheral blood, and found that vast majority of the NK cells in lymphoid tissues are
immature and deficient in ADCC activity because:1) they do not express Fc-gamma receptor IIIA (CD16a); 2)
they produce very little cytolytic molecules such as granzyme B and perforin. The objective of this grant is to
study how to improve Fc-dependent effector cell functions to clear HIV-1 reservoirs using human tissue biopsies
and humanized mouse models. We aim to: 1) develop the novel approaches to enhance ADCP activity; 2)
improve maturation of NK cells in lymphoid tissues to acquire ADCC activity. Our study will provide critical
implications to antibody-based HIV cure research."
10872272,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The proposed studies are part of our long-term effort to elucidate fundamental mechanisms underlying
chromosome dynamics and bacterial envelope biogenesis in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.
Compaction of replicated chromosomes into morphologically and spatially distinct sister chromatids is
essential for faithful DNA segregation in all organisms. The goal of our research is to broadly elucidate how B.
subtilis organizes and segregates its chromosomes but we have placed particular emphasis on defining the
activity and function of the broadly conserved SMC condensin complex in these processes. Our studies have
revealed that these ring-shaped ATPases extrude DNA loops. Loop extrusion ensures that these complexes
act in cis drawing DNA in on itself and away from its sister chromosome. This activity can explain how SMC
complexes can resolve newly replicated origins in bacteria and sister chromatids in eukaryotes. Our future
research seeks to establish whether loop extrusion mediates origin resolution and the extent to which it drives
the dynamic rearrangements of the chromosome during the replication-segregation cycle. Separately, we will
define the molecular basis for site-specific unloading of SMC complexes by XerD at the replication terminus.
Analysis of chromosome dynamics in this simple bacterial system will provide mechanistic insight and a level
of resolution not possible in more complex organisms.
The bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) is composed of long glycan strands cross-linked together by short
peptides. This three-dimensional meshwork protects the cell from osmotic lysis, determines shape, and its
assembly is the target of some of our most successful antibiotics. Accordingly, a deeper understanding of cell
wall biogenesis has broad implications for both basic bacterial cell biology and therapeutic development.
Research over the last half century has identified virtually all the factors involved in envelope assembly. A
major gap in our knowledge is how these enzymes are coordinated with each other and how the cell monitors
the envelope for defects and directs their repair. Our future research is focused on three signal transduction
pathways that play central roles in these processes. The WalR-WalK two-component signaling system is
involved in the homeostatic control of cell wall hydrolases required for growth. The SigI-RsgI pathway
monitors the cell wall meshwork and induces PG remodeling enzymes when it identifies defects. Finally, the
SigM-YhdLK pathway monitors the universal lipid carrier undecaprenyl-phosphate and prioritizes its use for
cell wall synthesis. We seek to define how these pathways function in molecular detail. Our findings will
provide broadly relevant principles for envelope assembly and maintenance in all bacteria."
10872273,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this application is to develop a small molecule(s) that targets both the AR and
epigenetic dysfunction for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Uncontrolled activation
of androgen receptor (AR) is responsible for the development and progression of prostate cancer (PCa).
Similarly, epigenetic events mediated through histone-modifying enzymes, such as histone deacetylases
(HDACs), are essential to the regulation of AR signaling. Inhibition of HDACs suppress PCa cell proliferation
through multiple mechanisms including AR degradation that results in the inhibition of AR signaling. Although,
the current AR inhibitors (enzalutamide and abiraterone) are initially effective, these treatments eventually fail
because of factors such as, AR-splice variants (AR-SVs) and AR responding to stimuli other than androgen.
Systemic HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), despite promising preclinical efficacy, have shown sub-optimal effects in
clinical studies of patients with CRPC. An effective way to control the emergence and treatment of CRPC is to
develop small molecules that employ multiple mechanisms to either inhibit AR expression or promote its
degradation. If there is no AR, there would be no AR signaling, regardless of whether or how much androgen
or other stimuli of AR signaling are present in CRPC. The hypothesis is that rationally designed antiandrogen-
equipped HDACi with enhanced bioavailability and potency will constitute a new generation of novel, targeted
anti-PCa agents that will effectively inhibit the growth of both AR+ and AR-SV early stage PCa and CRPC by
directly targeting AR through its degradation. The preliminary studies have furnished lead compounds
(antiandrogen-HDACi) which engage with AR for selective tumor/tissue distribution, and potently inhibit AR,
HDACs 1 and 6 for therapeutic impact. The proposed research will solve two problems of main-stream cancer
therapy agents – resistance development of antiandrogens and lack of solid tumor efficacy of HDACi – to
furnish a novel class of targeted agents with potential to positively impact CRPC treatment. The specific aims
are: 1) Identify antiandrogen-HDACi with optimized pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and clean toxicity profile.
2) Investigate the mechanism of action and characterize the correlation between intracellular HDAC and AR
inhibition in the promising antiandrogen-HDACi. 3) Determine the therapeutic efficacy of the promising
antiandrogen-HDACi to inhibit CRPC growth in patient’s derived xenograft (PDX) and orthotopic implantation
models via oral administration."

The instrument to be acquired is a state-of-the-art Pulsed Q-band Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR)
spectrometer and will be a multi-user shared instrument at the Integrated Molecular Structure Education and
Research Center (IMSERC) user facility, accessible to all Northwestern University (NU) users and users of the
greater Chicago area. The objective is to support the major user needs, from structural biology of folded proteins,
intrinsically disordered proteins, to biomolecular assemblies developed as novel therapeutic agents. The
spectrometer configuration is optimized for distance measurements between spin labels, transition metal centers
and nuclear spins, and their combinations in both the strong and weak coupling limit and between species with
differences in EPR frequency exceeding the resonator bandwidth. These objectives will be achieved with a pulsed
Q-band EPR spectrometer equipped with arbitrary waveform generation (AWG), a high-power (300 Watt)
microwave amplifier, a QT-II resonator that can be strongly overcoupled for pulsed dipolar EPR spectroscopy
(PDS), a Electron Nuclear Double Resonance (ENDOR) resonator and a cryogen-free cryostat that accommodates
both resonators to operate at 5-300 K, on demand. The Q-band frequency, the bandwidth and B1 conversion
efficiency of the resonators combined with the high-power microwave and AWG is an ideal hardware
configuration for Double Electron Electron Resonance (DEER). It is additionally suitable for experiments relying
on single frequency broad-band excitation, such as Relaxation Induced Dipolar Modulation Experiment (RIDME)
that is suitable for distance measurements between a spin label and a fast-relaxing transition metal. This will be
the first shared pulsed Q-band system established in a user facility at NU. The expert labs of Wasielewski and
Hoffman have specialized EPR setups configured for quantum information science and metallobiology but are
not equipped with a pulsed Q-band systems that offer high microwave power and continuous cryogen-free
operation, all of which are key to user operation. The Han lab is equipped with a similar instrument, without
ENDOR, but the usage of this lab’s Q-band instrument reaches 100% AUT by the Han lab users alone. When
combined with the total user need for pulsed Q-band EPR proposed for the requested instrument, AUT easily
reaches 200%. Automated sharing of the Han lab resource will keep both instruments fully occupied. This is
reflective of one major limitation of DEER today: long experimental times of 12 to 24 hours for one single
experiment is routine, while the total major user needs readily exceeds 7 to 14 experiments per week. The Han
lab is collaborating with experts to develop and test innovative methods aimed at shortening the experimental
time by implementing non-uniform sampling, by signal averaging with pre-processed single scan data and by
applying a total analysis of signal and background in one through wavelet-based singular value decomposition to
maximize reliable information extracted from time domain EPR data. Our goal is to increase the AUT efficiency
over time by implementing innovation in data science tools in the EPR core of the IMSERC facility."
10869481,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Preliminary work has shown that two different environmental hepatocarcinogens, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and
N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), produce high-resolution mutational spectra (HRMS) that occur shortly after
carcinogen exposure, are distinct from one another, and are mechanistically in accord with the established
mutational properties of the DNA adducts these agents form. Extending that work, the goal of the proposed
project is to develop a “blood-based” analytical tool enabling rapid detection of the mutational profiles of these
agents. The hypothesis to be tested is that mechanistically informative mutational fingerprints of environmental
toxicants are present in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from blood of exposed individuals. This
project will address a gap in knowledge connecting environmental exposures to cancer risk.
 Sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed ~100 mutational patterns termed “signatures,” with some
signatures showing similarity to mutational spectra produced by known environmental carcinogens (e.g., UV
light, AFB1, benzo(a)pyrene). Currently, there is no facile way to measure the genetic consequences of prior
genotoxic exposures because of: (1) the invasive procedures required to obtain tissue samples, and (2) the
insensitivity of “typical” DNA sequencing methods. This proposal will take advantage of recent advances to
overcome these limitations. Consisting of fragments ~170 bp long, cfDNA originates from normal cell turnover
as well as from apoptotic and necrotic cells following exposure to toxins. Conventional NextGen DNA sequencing
tools cannot reliably identify the low levels of mutations that are present in cfDNA. To overcome this sensitivity
limitation, we shall use Duplex Consensus Sequencing, which we have shown affords up to 104-fold higher
accuracy/sensitivity over conventional sequencing.
 The Specific Aims will determine if HRMS previously observed in mouse liver genomic DNA following
treatment with AFB1 and NDMA can be identified in cfDNA in blood. Aim 1 will quantify the levels of cfDNA in
blood after treatment. Circulating cfDNA will be assayed at several times after treatment to determine the
temporal relationship between exposure, hepatotoxicity and the levels of cfDNA in blood. Aim 2 will determine
compound-specific mutational spectra in cfDNA and compare them to spectra obtained from genomic DNA from
target tissue (liver) as well as white blood cells from blood, lymph nodes and thymus. Aim 3 will examine
mutational spectra in liver-specific cfDNA generated by challenging the animals with mild hepatotoxicants (e.g.,
ethanol, acetaminophen), which trigger increased cell turnover. The success of these studies will provide an
innovative approach to mutational fingerprinting of environmental exposures that could, in turn, lead to predictive
biomarkers that would trigger interventions to limit future exposures and reduce healthcare needs by preventing
the development of advanced disease."
10864607,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this project, the investigators will explore the feasibility of using their cell-based platform for delivering
immunostimulatory proteins (IS) to achieve tumor regression in an in vivo pilot. Certain immunostimulatory
proteins have activity against the minimal disease in most solid tumors. However, their systemic delivery does
not permit sufficient concentrations to treat advanced disease, and their excess is associated with severe
toxicities. The challenge is to enable a localized dose at high concentration that can treat advanced disease
without undesired side effects. The team's mission is to harness the immune system to treat solid tumors. In
line with this mission, their objective in this project is to re-configure their current cell-based delivery system to
synthesize calibrated amounts of immunostimulatory proteins within the tumor microenvironment (TME); and
validate the antitumor effect in a high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) mouse model. The feasibility of
the proposed experiments is supported by our previous publications and new preliminary data. Of particular
relevance to the present application is the localized expression of the immunostimulatory protein, which others
have shown to exert antitumor effects but is also toxic when delivered systemically. The team has already
modified tumor cells for reporting the activity of their cell-based delivery system in vitro and developed an
animal model with these tumor cells to assess the efficacy in vivo. The rationale is that the cell-based delivery
platform will enable high, TME-localized doses of the immunostimulatory protein, proportionate to the tumor
burden. The team plans to pursue this project in two aims: 1) Scale up the cells engineered to produce the
immunostimulatory protein upon engaging HGSOC cells; and 2) Demonstrate function in an HGSOC mouse
model. This project is significant because it will A) enable a strategy for site-specific delivery of high doses of
immunostimulatory proteins to target high tumor burden, and B) result in a process that can be scaled up
during preclinical studies in immunocompetent mice, as well as additional IND-enabling studies in compliance
with cGMP protocols. We believe this project is innovative and a substantive departure from the status quo
because instead of attempting to improve immunostimulatory protein bioavailability by exogenous delivery or
by inducing endogenous expression that is only effective against the minimal disease, we will use our cell-
based technology for enhancing immunostimulatory protein delivery to the TME. This will enable sufficient local
immunostimulatory protein concentrations to treat advanced disease."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable non-invasive imaging technology, but it is expensive and out of
reach for many centers, especially those in rural areas of the US and developing countries. MRI’s significant
siting requirements for safe operation can double or triple the cost of systems, and therefore are a major barrier
to access. The growing popularity of portable MRI systems highlights the demand for more accessible and
affordable MRI technology, but these systems do not offer the same image quality and versatility as conventional
clinical scanners and remain specialized equipment dedicated to specific populations and conditions. This
proposal aims to advance the technology needed to dramatically reduce the siting burden of
conventional superconducting scanners (factor of ~2x), thus drastically improving patient access to
whole-body systems that are applicable to all populations and conditions.
 The proposal introduces and validates a new approach combining passive and active radiofrequency
(RF) radiation cancellation in the far-field regime. We are developing the approach through a comprehensive
program of electromagnetic modeling, system design, and experimental verification to solve the problem of
transmit Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) in MRI without using a Faraday cage. We leverage 20 years of
research and expertise in electromagnetic modeling and parallel transmission (pTx) technology to tackle this
new and important problem that has received little-to-no attention from the engineering community.
 Importantly, this proposal aligns with my research background and interests and was specifically
designed in conjunction with my mentors to enable me to become an independent investigator. A K99/R00 award
would help me jumpstart a bioengineering career focused on addressing clinically important problems through
innovative technological approaches. Following the R00 phase, I plan to continue my career at the cutting edge
of technology development for MRI, maximizing the impact on patient health and accessibility. My ultimate goal
is to develop into an independent investigator who creates and applies new technology to improve the
accessibility and affordability of MRI while maintaining high standards of safety and quality for patient care.
 The Martinos Center at Massachusetts General Hospital provides an ideal environment and infrastructure
to execute the proposed research strategy. The Center offers extensive hardware and computing resources, as
well as several large-bore MR scanners that will facilitate the technical development of this proposal, aiming to
eliminate the need for a Faraday shielded cage. To facilitate my transition to independence, I have collaborated
with my mentors to design a training program that includes coursework, specialized seminars, and clinical
shadowing. During the K99 phase, I will be mentored by world-leading experts in MRI physics and hardware
development (Dr. Lawrence L. Wald), neuroradiology (Dr. Susie Yi Huang), and MRI RF coil development and
optimization (Dr. Bastien Guerin). Their expertise and mentorship will guide me in this project and my training."
10864668,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Most plants have evolved the capacity to synthetize large, complex metabolites that potently target animal
physiology. While we have adopted some of these molecules as useful medicines (Taxol, colchicine, morphine,
Velban), we understand a miniscule fraction of the chemistry that most plants are capable of. Most of the 3k-15k
enzymes per genome involved in specialized metabolism have unknown roles, including in the genomes of plants
we regularly consume as food. Learning the roles of these genes would not only illuminate what molecules a
plant can synthesize, but also would allow us to (1) produce these molecules exogenously, (2) to directly assess
their bioactivity, (3) make informed dietary decisions, and (4) genetically delete molecules from dietary plants.
However, this is a challenging task because plant genetics is limited, plant genomes are large, and biosynthetic
genes are often silent except under specific conditions.
The aim of this proposal is to develop and apply tools that will systematically activate and identify different
biosynthetic gene sets, efficiently defining a plants’ arsenal of biochemical pathways. In Aim 1, I will achieve this
by the targeted activation of hundreds of transcription factors that regulate diverse biosynthetic pathways. During
my K99 phase, I will develop this approach in tomato, a plant with relatively good genetic tools, optimizing a
combination of multiplexed gene activation and single-cell measurement. I will also train with Dr. Jennifer
Brophy’s lab in in vitro plant cell assays, so that during the R00 phase I can expand this approach to studying
the biosynthetic dark matter of wheat and sorghum genomes. In Aim 2, I develop a variant of this methodology
compatible with genetically intractable plants. I will use panels of chemical perturbations to activate biosynthesis,
and a newly developed microfluidic technology to isolate and characterize cells with specialized biosynthetic
roles. This will enable an accelerated dissection of the biochemistry of medicinal plants like Taxus, our sole
source of the blockbuster drug Taxol.
To achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent researcher and pioneering a new scale of plant
science, I have assembled a mentorship team that will complement my training in systems and synthetic biology:
Dr. Elizabeth Sattely (mentor, plant biochemistry), Dr. Polly Fordyce (co-mentor, microfluidics and high
throughput biology), Dr. Jonathan Weissman (advisor, single-cell biology and screening), Dr. Jennifer Brophy
(advisor, plant synthetic biology), Dr. Bo Wang (advisor, single-cell technologies in noncanonical organisms). My
mentors and I have designed a plan with specific goals for scientific training, career development coaching,
scientific presentation, and coursework. The resources and thriving scientific environment at Stanford will help
me achieve these goals. With the training and mentorship provided by this K99 opportunity, I anticipate a smooth
transition to managing my own research group. There, I will establish a unique research program to develop
systematic approaches to study the biosynthesis and health impacts of specialized metabolites."

 Native Hawaiians are one of the fastest growing ethnic minorities in the US, and exhibit increased incidence
and mortality rates of colorectal cancer. To address these disparities, it is crucial to identify ethnic-specific genetic
variations among Native Hawaiians that could offer valuable insights into colorectal cancer susceptibility and
potential targets for intervention. By gaining a deeper understanding of these genetic differences, we aim to
improve health outcomes and positively impact the overall well-being of Native Hawaiians.
 We initiated an investigation to determine if Native Hawaiian colorectal cancer possesses distinct biological
variations by utilizing transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. Our findings revealed a set of differentially
expressed genes and somatic mutations that were significantly associated with Native Hawaiian colorectal
cancer. To validate the top mutated candidate genes predicted by RNA-seq, we performed whole genome DNA
sequencing analysis, and unveiled some previously unrecognized somatic mutations and oncogenic signaling
pathway. Therefore, we hypothesize that biologic variations unique in Native Hawaiian colorectal cancer drive
aggressive tumor development, and lead to higher mortality of colorectal cancer.
 To test this hypothesis, we will utilize pre-existing biospecimens and comprehensive epidemiology data
available from participants in the Multiethnic Cohort (U01CA164973) to identify the key risk factors contributing
to colorectal cancer development among Native Hawaiians. The project outlines three specific aims that building
on the preliminary studies: Aim 1: Utilize whole exome DNA sequencing to validate preliminary findings and
identify more specific genetic mutations present in colorectal cancers among Native Hawaiians; Aim 2: Profile
and establish unique metabolomic features specific to Native Hawaiians with colorectal cancer; Aim 3: Validate
the ethnic-specific genetic and metabolomic features associated with Native Hawaiian colorectal cancer risk and
clinical outcomes by independent cohort validation, while also comparing the findings with other ethnic cohorts.
In completing these aims, a robust population-specific model will be developed, integrating both genetic and
non-genetic factors, to identify high-risk Native Hawaiians who would benefit from screening and early
intervention measures.
 By combining genetic, metabolomic, clinicopathologic, and epidemiologic information, this will be the first
comprehensive study to examine exome-wide DNA, transcriptomic, and metabolomic profiles in colorectal tumor
tissue from Native Hawaiians. In doing so, we will establish a unique resource and provide a more complete
understanding of Native Hawaiian-colorectal cancer disease etiology and risk factors, which has the potential to
help eliminate Native Hawaiian colorectal cancer health disparities."

School entry is an important developmental stage during the life course. Developmental and behavioral health
at this stage, which includes cognitive, communication, and social-emotional development, are powerful
predictors of later educational attainment, a social determinant of health (SDOH), and long-term health and
wellbeing. Pediatric professionals in primary care have near-universal access to young children, frequent
contact with their families, and opportunities to build trusted caregiver-clinician relationships making primary
care the right place to support optimal developmental and behavioral health. Neuroplasticity makes early
childhood the right time to intervene since developmental and behavioral health promotion interventions can
have large effects during this developmental stage. However, to date, healthcare interventions have largely
missed the opportunity to support optimal developmental and behavioral health in primary care settings.
Primary care literacy promotion, a pediatric standard of care supported by the American Academy of Pediatrics
and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners, represents an exception and is an exemplar
prevention and health promotion intervention that can promote optimal developmental and behavioral health at
scale. However, prior work by our team and others points to inconsistent implementation that threatens to
dilute its impact. Patient-oriented research that applies SDOH and prevention and health promotion lenses is
needed to help address this gap. The overall objectives of this K24 application are to provide Dr. Manuel E.
Jimenez with mentorship-focused protected time to: (1) augment his research capabilities building on his
funded patient-oriented research program that uses community-engaged research and implementation science
to address SDOH in primary care, and (2) mentor the next generation of interprofessional clinician
investigators and enhance their capabilities to apply SDOH and prevention and health promotion lenses on
patient-oriented research. To achieve these objective Dr Jimenez proposes the following specific aims: (1) To
examine which literacy promotion components are most important and why from the perspective of literacy
promotion experts and caregivers, (2) To identify consensus on literacy promotion core components among
intervention experts and other key partners including families, and (3) to develop an intervention that supports
tailored literacy promotion implementation strategies and test the feasibility of the intervention in community
health centers. The application addresses multiple NINR priority areas and will help train the next generation of
clinician scientists in SDOH, health equity, community health, and intervention research that positively impacts
practice and policy (NOT-NR-21-001) to help address the pressing health challenges facing the nation."

 In several high-income nations, including the United States, infectious syphilis has been resurgent for
over two decades now, while syphilis is still endemic in low- and middle-income countries. Syphilis is therefore
still a public global health concern, particularly because it can lead to neurological sequelae such as dementia
and stroke-like syndromes, as well as cardiovascular manifestations potentially leading to death. Furthermore,
about half a million pregnancies are adversely affected by congenital transmission of the pathogen every year.
The partial success of recent syphilis control campaigns promoted by the CDC and WHO clearly highlights the
necessity of devising novel ways to control this serious infection.
 The availability of an effective syphilis vaccine could make a significant difference in the global effort to
control the spread of this serious infection. Over the last decade, our research programs have had the focus of
identifying vaccine candidates among the surface-exposed antigens of the syphilis agent, Treponema pallidum
subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum). These studies have led to the discovery that the T. pallidum repeat (Tpr) protein
family and the Tp0751 vascular adhesin are critical proteins in the processes of chancre development/immune
evasion and systemic dissemination, respectively. When tested in immunization/challenge experiments in the
rabbit model of syphilis, these antigens were shown to provide significant protection against infection.
Furthermore, within these antigens, we have been able to pinpoint the epitopes necessary to generate a
protective host response.
 To reduce the complexity and production costs of our vaccine candidates, we have developed a
chimeric protein platform where the non-functional loops of the Tp0751 protein are exchanged with conserved
epitopes from the Tpr proteins. This approach provides a single construct that retains the critical Tp0751
epitopes while allowing presentation of protective epitopes from other antigens in a stable and soluble scaffold.
This proposal encompasses the next phase of this research endeavor consisting of Investigational New Drug
(IND)-enabling pre-clinical studies. To this end, we will create future generations of the chimera vaccine
candidate to assess the level of induced immunoreactivity and protection, after which the vaccine delivery
formulation will be optimized with the lead candidate by performing in vivo immunization/challenge
experiments, toxicity and stability tests, and studies investigating compatibility with scale-up production.
 Collectively these studies are anticipated to provide us with an efficacious syphilis vaccine candidate
that is ready for clinical studies."

Dental caries is one of the most significant public health challenges in Alaska Native
communities. Added sugars from fruit drinks, especially Kool-Aid, are the main behavioral
risk factor for caries. Our team developed and implemented a community-based

U01DE027629). The six-month intervention consisted of health education delivered by a
trained indigenous Community Health Worker, who taught families about the harms
caused by sugared fruit drinks, introduced sugar-free alternatives, and provided parents
with self-efficacy training to facilitate the switch. Local stores were recruited to sell sugar-
free Kool-Aid. We enrolled 201 Alaska Native children ages 1 to 10 years; 143 children in
two communities received the intervention and 58 children a third community were in the
delayed treatment control group. The trial ended in March 2023. Our team is currently
evaluating the intervention. The main trial outcome is change in added sugar intake from
baseline to 6m, measured using a validated hair biomarker. The trial did not include a
disease outcome, but we collected supragingival plaque samples from children
throughout the trial (baseline, 1m, 3m, 6m) and archived them for future study. We now
have tribal permissions to analyze the plaque. The goal of this 2-year R03 is to process
and analyze the 594 banked plaque samples. The Aims are to: (1) Assess the relationship
between added sugar intake and the oral microbiome in Alaska Native children; and (2)
Conduct mediator analyses to examine the effects of the intervention on the microbiome
with added sugar as the mediator. We will test the primary hypothesis that lower added
sugar intake is associated with increased alpha diversity, which is a signature of a healthy
microbiome. The proposed work will be the first known study to evaluate how added sugar
impacts the microbiome in Alaska Native children and is expected to provide insight on
mechanisms of the original behavioral trial. The knowledge gained will be critical in
refining future interventions aimed at reducing added sugar intake, preventing caries, and
addressing oral health inequities that disproportionately affect Indigenous communities."

This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Lyen Huang, a surgeon and health services researcher at the
University of Utah. Dr. Huang is establishing himself as a young investigator in perioperative patient safety. His
current research focuses on reducing our healthcare system’s contributions to the opioid crisis. This K23 will
enable Dr. Huang to accomplish the following goals: (1) develop expertise in using patient-facing behavior
change components for promoting healthy behaviors, (2) develop expertise in implementation science to close
the gap more rapidly between research and health system interventions, (3) gain leadership and management
skills to support transdisciplinary, multi-institutional research and trials, and (4) transition to an independent
research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Huang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of a primary
mentor, Dr. Kimberly Kaphingst, a leading researcher in health literacy, patient-provider communication, and
behavior change interventions; and a co-mentor, Dr. Alex Sox-Harris, a national expert in surgical and
addiction health services research and implementation science. Dr. Huang also has five advisors with
expertise in surgical leadership; perioperative, addiction medicine, and cancer health equity interventions;
pragmatic trials in rural communities; clinical trials; biostatistics; and survey methodology.
Although 42 million patients are prescribed opioids after surgery each year, we currently lack an effective and
scalable intervention for motivating patients to dispose of leftover opioids. Few patients dispose of their leftover
opioids, and existing interventions have shown mixed real-world results. Instead, patients insecurely store,
misuse, or share opioids putting themselves, families, and communities at risk. The objective of Dr. Huang’s
research is to develop and implement a theory- and evidence-based opioid disposal intervention. Dr. Huang
will (Aim 1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of behavior change components to enhance the University
of Utah’s current disposal intervention; (Aim 2) prepare for implementation and evaluation in different
populations and settings; and (Aim 3) test and refine the enhanced opioid disposal intervention. The expected
outcome will provide the evidence for multi-institutional trials of an intervention to promote safe opioid disposal
across the country. The proposed research is innovative in the application of behavior change and
implementation theories to the prevention of iatrogenic contributions to the opioid crisis and the use of an
ongoing system-wide opioid disposal intervention allowing for rapid, iterative refinement and evaluation."

The environment contains far more information than the brain can process at once. Visual attention
helps us cope with such information overload by selectively processing relevant information. In many
situations, humans need to select arbitrary features in a scene. Theories of attention have proposed
that such selection is mediated by a priority representation that encodes the relative importance of
each visual stimulus in the scene. However, much remains unknown regarding how the brain
computes and maintains attentional priority for features. Our long-term goal is to understand how the
brain selects different types of information via population neural activity to serve goal-directed
behavior. In this project, we will examine the neural basis of two basic properties of feature attention:
its resolution and capacity. We hypothesize that distinct areas in the dorsal frontoparietal network
encode priority information with different resolution and capacity limit, supported by distinct neural
population activity profiles. We will test this overall hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims. First,
we will establish functional specializations in frontoparietal areas in representing feature priority with
different levels of resolution. Second, we will examine the nature of priority signals that gives rise to
the capacity limit in attending to multiple stimuli. Third, we will quantify the dimensionality of priority
signals and examine how neural dimensionality determines the resolution and capacity of the priority
representation. The proposed research is expected to significantly advance our understanding of how
the brain selects visual features, in terms of the neural machinery and computational principles that
enable such selection. A deeper understanding of how the brain selects visual features will provide
important constraints for theories and models of attention and can potentially transform our
understanding of visual information processing and cognitive control. The research project is
innovative both in terms of conceptual and methodological advances. Conceptually, the project will
test novel hypotheses regarding the functional dissociations in frontoparietal cortex and the
underlying computational principles of neural coding. Methodologically, the project employs a multi-
modal approach including behavioral, neuroimaging, and neuroperturbation techniques,
complemented by advanced data analytical and computational modeling methods, to gain
fundamental insights into the brain mechanisms of visual attention."

 Proper immune function is pivotal to the human health. CD4+ T cell is a central component of adaptive
immunity to coordinate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Immune suppressive regulatory T (Treg)
cells are pivotal in immune homeostasis and self-tolerance, and their function is controlled through quite
diverse mechanisms, allowing Treg cells to respond appropriately to diverse environmental cues to ensure
proper immune response. It is important to investigate the functional protein networks underlying T and Treg
cell function in immune homeostasis and diseases. We have identified many critical factors, pathways, and
mechanisms for T and Treg cell function in the last funding period, during which we revealed an unexpected
critical role for an innate senor AIM2 (Absent In Melanoma 2) in controlling Treg cell function in a recent study.
 We found that AIM2 is expressed at much higher levels in Treg cells than in innate cells, in both human
and mouse. TGFβ promotes AIM2 expression coinciding with Treg cell generation. Unlike Asc-/- and ICE-/-
(caspase-1-/-11-/--) mice that are resistant to EAE, Aim2-/- mice developed more severe EAE than WT mice.
AIM2 deletion leads to reduced Treg cell function during inflammatory diseases such as EAE. AIM2 is required
for Treg cell stability to mitigate EAE. AIM2-deficiency leads to the hyper-activation of Akt-mTOR signaling to
attenuate Treg cell function with altered immune metabolism. These exciting findings prompt us to hypothesize
that the expression and function of AIM2 in Treg cells are controlled through mechanisms both distinct from
and shared with those found in the innate cells, to uphold tolerance and restrain autoimmunity. To test this
hypothesis, we strive to reach the following research aims. AIM 1: Reveal the genetic and molecular
mechanisms of TGFβ promoted Aim2 expression in Treg cells. AIM 2: Investigate if AIM2 controls Treg cell
function by integrating DNA-sensing function and inflammasome components. AIM 3: Mechanistic study of the
functional AIM2-interacting protein network underlying AIM2 controlled Treg cell function.
 This proposed study will highlight a previously unappreciated critical role for AIM2 in Treg cells. It will
revise the current paradigm for the function of AIM2 by incorporating its Treg cell specific function. It will
provide new insights into how Treg cell generation and function can be regulated. It will shed new lights on the
molecular networks underlying Treg cell function and to reveal potential novel molecular targets and therapies
for autoimmune diseases."

The overall goal of this project is to understand how the spatial organization of signaling molecules on the cell
membrane regulates signal transduction. Extracellular stimuli are transduced across the plasma membrane,
processed, and amplified along the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer, and then further delivered into the cytoplasm
and nucleus. It has been shown that proteins and lipids are organized into membrane domains to mediate signal
transduction though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The T cell receptor (TCR) pathway
represents an ideal system for studying this phenomenon. Dozens of the components of the TCR pathway are
enriched in the T cell microcluster, a membrane-associated micron-sized domain that is essential for TCR
signaling. Our recent work suggested that T cell microclusters are phase-separated condensates driven by
multivalent protein-protein interactions. What is lacking, however, is an understanding of how the formation of
these microclusters is regulated by the local membrane environment, where significant changes occur in both
lipid composition and membrane geometry upon TCR activation. Therefore, this proposal aims to determine the
mechanism by which lipids and membrane geometry regulate the assembly of T cell microclusters and the
associated functional consequences during T cell activation. The following questions will be addressed: How do
charged lipids modulate T cell microcluster formation? How does membrane geometry influence microcluster
function? How do microclusters affect T cells’ killing activity? Answering these questions will significantly impact
the field because it will reveal how the protein machineries and lipid bilayers coordinate to process and amplify
the signal from antigen stimuli to cell activation. Moreover, the majority of currently identified phase-separated
structures are 3-D droplets located in the nucleus or cytoplasm whereas T cell microclusters are 2-D domains
on the membrane. Understanding the functional relationship between T cell microclusters and lipid bilayers is
expected to create a new research interface between the field of protein self-assembly and membrane signaling."

Celiac disease is a chronic immune disorder driven by gluten that typically develops in childhood. Over 1% of
the world population is affected, many of whom are undiagnosed. Many more have an uncertain diagnosis
because current diagnostic tests are not reliable in individuals following a gluten-free diet. Therefore, there is a
strong need for better diagnostic methods that reflect the underlying causes of celiac disease and overcome the
limitations of existing tests. Previous studies have shown that an increase in a cytokine called interleukin 2 (IL-
2) is the earliest and most sensitive marker of acute gluten ingestion in adults with celiac disease who are on a
gluten-free diet. This method is not practical for diagnosis because patients who are on a gluten-free diet do not
want to suffer symptoms of gluten ingestion and it is impractical for patients who are eating gluten to go on a
gluten-free diet treatment just to confirm the diagnosis. An alternative to challenging patients with gluten is to
challenge the immune cells in blood with gluten. In over 300 adults with celiac disease on a gluten-free diet, an
ex vivo whole blood gluten challenge assay in which IL-2 is measured after blood has been incubated with gluten
had near perfect specificity and high sensitivity for adults with celiac disease treated with a gluten-free diet. There
is a need to conduct studies in children because celiac disease typically develops in this age group. As well,
there may be age-related differences in immune responses. Therefore, the main goal of this research grant is to
further investigate the immune response to gluten in children with celiac disease using the ex vivo gluten
challenge whole blood assay. A cohort of 80 children with celiac disease (40 treated and 40 untreated) will be
recruited. In Aim 1, the sensitivity of IL-2 rise in the ex vivo gluten challenge whole blood assay will be determined
in the overall cohort. In a pre-planned secondary analysis, sensitivity in treated and untreated celiac disease will
be compared. In Aim 2, an immune response signature of ex vivo gluten challenge will be determined using a
panel of cytokines known to be elevated following oral gluten challenge (CCL20, CXCL9, IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10,
IL-17A, IL-22, IP-10, and TNF-α). The sensitivity of each cytokine for detecting celiac disease will be determined
as well as whether using a combination of cytokines improves the accuracy of the test. This novel study will
determine whether IL-2 release in ex vivo gluten challenge whole blood assay is a sensitive marker of celiac
disease in children. Critically, it will also be determined whether ex vivo gluten challenge evokes an immune
response in children with untreated celiac disease. Results of this study will guide protocol development for a
multi-center clinical trial to determine the diagnostic accuracy of cytokine release following gluten challenge for
diagnosis of celiac disease. Results of this trial may redefine celiac disease and revolutionize diagnosis."

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) are transcription factors with critical
roles in the immune and endocrine systems. While there is considerable knowledge of Stat-
mediated gene control, we know far less about lineage-restricted Stat functions. Understanding
cell-specific actions is necessary for progress in diseases impacted by Stat dysfunction –
including cancer, infertility, metabolic disorders, immunodeficiency, and chronic inflammation.
We have evidence that Stat5B is pivotal for mast cell function. Like several other Stat proteins,
Stat5B forms dimers and tetramers. We find that Stat5B dimers and tetramers have some
similar and some opposing functions. Dimers and tetramers promote cytokine secretion. But
while Stat5B dimers promote mast cell histamine production and cell migration, tetramers
appear to inhibit both functions. These data are consistent in vitro and in a model of systemic
anaphylaxis. Therefore, our hypothesis is that Stat5B dimers and tetramers have distinct effects
on mast cell function, with tetramers often limiting the effects of dimers. Understanding this
fundamental biology has considerable translational potential. Therefore, we propose creating
several strains of mice that allow lineage-specific deletion of Stat5B or selective expression of a
Stat5B mutant that can form protein dimers but not tetramers. These mice will make possible
detailed studies of Stat5B, allowing us to understand how this protein contributes to the function
of specific cell types."

Self-regulation is the ability to manage one’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors to achieve desired goals
through a variety of cognitive and emotional processes. It is an important aspect of self-management, which
plays a primary role in the efficacious treatment mechanisms of chronic pain, such as fibromyalgia.
Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread pain, impaired sleep, fatigue, and
depression. While non-pharmacologic treatment, such as Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT), has shown
efficacy in improving fibromyalgia-related symptoms via self-management skills, little is known about the
underlying neurobiological mechanisms of these benefits. Reduction of negative cognitive and emotional
processes, such as pain catastrophizing—which involves helplessness, rumination, and magnification of pain
complaints—via self-regulation, has been suggested as one of the central mechanistic pathways supporting
the benefits following CBT. In fact, many studies have shown that pain catastrophizing is the most consistent
psychosocial factor predicting treatment prognosis in chronic musculoskeletal pain, such as fibromyalgia. Thus,
we propose investigating the neural correlates of self-regulation, their association with catastrophizing, and the
role of changes in self-regulatory capacity in contributing to CBT’s benefits. Neural mechanisms during self-
regulation can be investigated and assessed using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
neurofeedback, which allows observing and regulating one’s brain activity. The neural target in our study is
defined from our published study demonstrating that the ventral posterior cingulate cortex (vPCC) and
retrosplenial cortex (RSC)—key nodes of the brain’s default mode network—encode pain catastrophizing.
Thus, our study will apply fMRI neurofeedback as a probe to elucidate the neurobiological mechanisms
underlying the self-regulation of pain catastrophizing. Specifically, our Aims will: (1) Evaluate the effect of CBT
on neural mechanisms of catastrophizing self-regulation, assessed with real-time fMRI neurofeedback and (2)
Predict clinical improvement following CBT with baseline brain response during pain catastrophizing self-
regulation. Furthering our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying self-regulation of pain
catastrophizing in chronic pain will enable clinicians to boost the efficacy of CBT and facilitate the development
of multimodal treatment packages, while patients gain control over their cognitive and emotional processes."

Hypertension (HTN) is a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Systolic Blood Pressure
Intervention Trial (SPRINT) was performed in hypertensive individuals with high CVD risk. The study showed
that blood pressure (BP) target of <120mm Hg compared with <140mm Hg significantly reduced CVD events
and all-cause deaths [1]. However, almost 15% of all SPRINT participants experienced serious adverse events
(SAEs) including hypotension, syncope, bradycardia, acute kidney injury (AKI), and electrolyte abnormalities [1].
Our data point towards the contribution of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) in this process.
EC system is an ancient, preserved, but only recently discovered biological system shown to play a pivotal role
in regulation of BP [2]. The ECS is composed of endocannabinoids, including anandamide (AEA), the enzymes
that produce and degrade endocannabinoids and their receptors. Interestingly, similarly to subjects that reported
SAEs within the SPRINT trial, acute cannabis users present with bradycardia, hypotension, syncope and
electrolyte abnormalities [3, 4]. Supporting studies in hypertensive animals have indicated the essential role of
AEA-mediated signaling in the development of bradycardia and hypotension [5-10]. Interestingly, renin-
angiotensin system, which is the main target of antihypertensive therapy, seems to be reciprocally regulated with
the ECS e.g. increase in AEA reduces vasoconstrictive and hypertensive effects of angiotensin II [11, 12].
In our previous data, we showed reduced plasma levels of AEA in hypertensive non-CKD subjects and CKD as
well as autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients as compared to healthy subjects [13].
Furthermore, intensive BP control in ADPKD patients (SBP <110mm Hg) as performed within the HALT-PKD
trial, led to an increase of plasma levels of AEA and its congeners [13]. Based on these data, we hypothesize
that intensive (<120mm Hg) as compared to standard (<140mm Hg) BP control in SPRINT participants
will be accompanied by higher levels of AEA and its congeners. We also hypothesize that subjects with
a greater rate of AEA increase will present with a higher incidence of SEAs including hypotension,
syncope and bradycardia.
The knowledge gained from this first-of-its-kind study will allow to better understand the role of the EC system in
regulation of the blood pressure. With the increased use of cannabis and its active ingredients among general
population, the understanding of the interplay between the EC system and the cardiovascular function will be of
utmost importance for current patient management and future drug development studies."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) afflicts over 6.5 million Americans and is the sixth leading cause of death in the US.
Despite more than a decade of clinical research to uncover biologic drugs to resolve negative sequelae that
accrete due to AD, no disease-modifying agents have been shown to reverse AD-related neurodegeneration for
long durations. Rather, available therapeutics aim to counter neurotransmitter imbalances that account for a
subset of AD symptoms, and more recent immunotherapies are of controversial utility that is accompanied by
severe risks of edema. While deaths from stroke, HIV, and heart disease have decreased over the last two
decades, reported deaths from AD have more than doubled over the same period, reflecting a need for
innovations in AD treatment. Genetic engineering strategies and cell-based therapies aim to supply or stimulate
neural precursors, enhance structural neuroplasticity, and combat neuronal death, and therefore offer an avenue
to potentially turn the tide of neurodegeneration and resolve aspects of AD. However, to date, none of these
therapies has proven effective and have instead highlighted the need to find methods to dynamically control
behaviors of cells in the central nervous system (CNS) in accordance with signatures of pathology. Here, we
propose to investigate engineered astrocytes and microglia as programmable agents for disease-dependent
coordination of neuro-protective behaviors. Microglia and astrocytes play central roles in the CNS response to
amyloid-b (Ab) and hyperphosphorylated tau – the biochemical hallmarks of AD – making them attractive
candidates to selectively train for pre-defined functions in response to pathologic AD features. Thus, we aim to
develop a synthetic biology tool that allows astrocytes and microglia to produce biologic drugs in targeted CNS
sites displaying Ab-related signatures of AD pathology. In Aim 1, we will investigate whether our receptor platform
programs astrocytes within an organotypic slice culture to respond to Ab with engineered outputs that can
support neuronal health. In Aim 2, we will test whether our synthetic signaling module enables engineered
astrocytes and microglia to protect neurons and counteract Ab-driven degeneration in an in vitro stem cell model
of AD. Collectively, these experiments will establish the utility of an orthogonal signaling channel that governs
responses of either in situ engineered cells or stem cell-derived CNS cell replacements to pathogenic Ab."

Pregnant people are uniquely susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, with risks of severe maternal COVID-19
illness and obstetric complications. However, far less is known about the long-term impact of pregnancy-
associated SARS-CoV-2 infection on developing infants. Given the global burden, it is estimated that millions of
pregnant people have had SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prior work by our Studying Novel Infectious Pathogens in
Pregnancy (SNIPP) research team has identified distinct types of SARS-CoV-2-associated injury to the placenta,
such as maternal vascular malperfusion and COVID placentitis. Further, we have identified unique inflammatory
cytokine alterations in patients with specific types of placental lesions following SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy.
Maternal infection and inflammation can have a complex impact on early brain development and
neurodevelopmental health outcomes. However, there have been very limited studies with differing conclusions
addressing neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants born to mothers with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. The
existing literature to date utilizes methods limited by assessment of infants too early (≤12 months) and with
diagnosis codes rather than direct evaluation of the child. With continued viral evolution and a generation of
infants affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains critical to learn if and how SARS-CoV-2 infection in
pregnancy impacts childhood neurodevelopment health and risk of future dysfunction. Our central hypothesis is
that pregnancy-associated SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated placental injury increases risk of adverse early
childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes. We will investigate this hypothesis by utilizing our longitudinal SNIPP
cohort of mother-infant pairs affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy (n~4000) with archived
placental histopathology. We aim to characterize early childhood neurodevelopmental outcomes of infants
following maternal SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy by Aim 1(a): performing developmental assessments on
infants born to the SARS-CoV-2-infected cohort along with pandemic timeframe uninfected controls; and Aim
1(b): exploring associations between neurodevelopmental abnormalities and placental injury with or without
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In collaboration with Institute for Innovations in Developmental Sciences faculty,
assessments will be performed using validated online parent surveys and remote video visits, focusing on both
broad neurodevelopment and key domains for adaptive functioning: self-regulation and communication. A major
impact of this work would be the identification of high-risk children who need close developmental monitoring.
Strengths of our proposal include our large SNIPP cohort with paired biospecimens, sampling across the
pandemic timeframe, and our transdisciplinary approach harnessing expertise in perinatal infection, placental
pathology, and cutting-edge, pragmatic neurodevelopmental paradigms. This project uniquely poises us to
address an important gap in knowledge that can impact near-term neurodevelopmental care and, through future
research, lead to innovative risk stratification, mechanistic insight, and novel therapeutics to reduce harm."

Advances in structural biology techniques including single particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
have enabled unprecedented molecular insights into the function of biological macromolecules. However, the
study of many proteins and ribonucleoprotein complexes remains challenging due to current limitations in
sample preparation approaches. Traditionally, proteins of interest are produced in over-expression systems
within bacterial, insect, and mammalian cell lines. While this approach can allow the production and purification
of proteins with high yields, it often requires substantial optimization that can limit the study of biomedically
important membrane proteins and large protein complexes, especially where specific chaperones and cellular
conditions are required that are difficult to replicate in vitro. To overcome these limitations, we are developing
methodology to efficiently tag and purify endogenous proteins by leveraging advances in CRISPR/Cas gene
editing. This approach enables us to investigate macromolecular complexes and their intricate assembly
pathways under native and context-specific conditions that are relevant to human health and disease. We are
interested in developing and applying the approach in three major areas of study: constitutive protein
complexes, cell-type specific macromolecular assemblies, and cell state dependent membrane protein
complexes. Using the proteasome as a model system, we will investigate the assembly pathway of
proteasomal complexes by cryo-EM and mass spectrometry. This work will provide mechanistic insights into
critical protein degradation machinery and help to establish important methodology for the study of
endogenous protein assemblies. Next, we will expand our approach to the study of protein complexes in
different cell types, including hematopoietic and epithelial cells. This goal will be achieved by developing
efficient strategies to optimize CRISPR/Cas gene editing in specialized cell types, which will constitute an
important step towards the study of proteins in their native states. Finally, we will examine the conditional
assembly of protein complexes and membrane protein assemblies. For this direction, we will investigate
proteins involved in nutrient sensing at the lysosome in conjunction with mTOR signaling. This work will
provide molecular insights into the mechanisms regulating key metabolic pathways and shed light on how
mTOR integrates different signals to promote cell growth and proliferation. Additionally, we will establish
protocols for screening cellular and biochemical conditions to acquire context-specific protein assemblies.
Altogether, these studies will provide mechanistic insights into remarkable molecular machines and develop
important methodology that can be applied to the study of other biological systems. These methods will enable
us to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of proteins in specific cellular environments
and help advance structural biology towards understanding how biological macromolecules work in their native
contexts."

Patients with severe, refractory asthma constitute approximately 5% of all asthma patients but are responsible
for over 50% of all asthma-related healthcare costs. Biologic treatments for asthma, drugs which target
specific etiological pathways in particular asthma cases, have begun to emerge in the market as the first
individualized treatments for severe asthma. Cost of these biologics currently ranges from $10-$40k per year
and does not always improve asthma symptoms in some patients. The clinical decision to keep a patient on
a particular biologic is based on exacerbation count and asthma questionnaire responses at 12 weeks
following treatment initiation, by which time the patient has had 3 doses (at 0 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks).
Exacerbation count and patient responses to questionnaires were the primary endpoints of the clinical trials
which resulted in approval and are the primary biomarkers used in clinical evaluation of response, but patient-
specific biomarkers of lung function would be most beneficial for evaluation of response to these patient-
specific drugs. The lack of biomarkers which can predict response to biologic treatment is an unmet clinical
need. This study will address this unmet need by evaluating the potential of hyperpolarized 129Xe MRI (HPG)
to detect and predict biologic response in individual patients. Hyperpolarization is the process by which the
nuclear magnetism of 129Xe is greatly enhanced allowing it to be directly imaged by MRI. Subjects inhale the
xenon gas, and MRI are collected yielding high-resolution maps of regional lung ventilation. The overarching
hypothesis is that HPG MR can be performed in a routine clinical setting and will predict which patients
respond to treatment with mepolizumab, an anti-IL-5 biologic, 8 to 12 weeks sooner than standard clinical
assessment. HPG MRI will be performed in asthma patients slated to receive treatment by mepolizumab at
baseline, 4-week, and 12-week time points in order to assess its potential to assess, detect, and predict
patient response to mepolizumab. This may dramatically reduce costs and improve outcomes for these
patients."

 Maine ranks 12th and 8th in adult cancer incidence and mortality respectively, and pediatric cancer incidence rates are the third
highest in the nation, contributing to marked cancer health disparities in our state. In 2018, it is estimated there will be 8,600 new adult
cancer cases diagnosed in Maine; cancer is the most common cause of death in our state. Of these adult cases, 6,185 (72%) will
receive their care at a MaineHealth Cancer Care Network (MHCCN) hospital or outpatient facility. This patient volume is akin to any
major metropolitan cancer center. With only 1.3 million residents, Maine is a small state, is the most rural state, and has the oldest
population in the nation. There are significant cancer risk behaviors and exposures, and there are numerous socioeconomic and
geographic challenges as well, further compounding our cancer burden. The MHCCN is clearly organized around patient, health
provider, and healthcare system multi-tiered strategies and interventions that are prioritized in the NCORP solicitation and defended in
this proposal. Our health system embarked upon a comprehensive oncology strategic planning process in 2014 that in a relatively short
period has led to the opportunity to submit our response to this FOA. Consensus was reached on the model of cancer care that we
would pursue. The singular goal is to ensure that ""the right care, in the right location, as close to home as possible"" will be
provided. Cancer patients in our state and their families desire access to state-of-the-art patient-centered care. This NCORP
application could not come at a more auspicious time for our organization, coinciding with significant growth and substantive multi-
million dollar investment in MH Oncology over the past couple years. With this backdrop, the fundamental goal of our application is to
commit and contribute to a robust slate of NCORP activities across the lifespan including pediatric, adolescent and young adults,
adults, and elderly cancer patients in our communities and rural care settings. We have assembled a highly interactive and
interdisciplinary team across our network to participate in and lead this research endeavor. Our central hypothesis is that developing
a highly interactive and interdisciplinary approach to cancer care that is at all times patient-centered throughout MH Oncology will have
salutary effects on all aspects of our cancer care across the continuum of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship,
end-of-life, and care delivery not only for our patients and their families but for other aspects critical to our mission – including
educating the next generation of healthcare providers and expanding our research pursuits especially in rural areas within our care
network. We propose 4 aims: To conduct and actively participate in 1) cancer control research, 2) cancer prevention research, and 3)
cancer care delivery research studies; and 4) to capitalize upon clinical research opportunities afforded by NCORP and our newly
awarded Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research Network grant (1U54 GM115517). We will pursue these aims
across the lifespan engaging both children and adults. The MHCNN has every expectation that will we make substantive contributions
across the spectrum of the NCORP research portfolio. We will capitalize on our institutional assets, patient resources, and expertise
from the vantage point of community and rural settings to add value across the lifespan and provide leadership to the NCORP. We
welcome and value the opportunity to join the NCORP network as a new institutional member."
10895414,"Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are key to the formation of protein complexes, the active components
responsible for a multitude of cellular functions. Aberrant PPIs can have detrimental effects on essential

define the cell’s functional states at the systems-level is challenging due to limitations in existing approaches.
Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) has emerged as a powerful technology for PPI studies, owing to its
unique capability of preserving and capturing protein interactions in their native environments, as well as
uncovering PPI identities with structural details. Although current XL-MS technologies are successful in global
PPI analysis, unmet challenges still remain especially for complete illustration and quantitative assessment of
cellular networks, and spatial PPI mapping. This necessitates new developments to enhance technical
capabilities for advancing systems structural biology. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the major
degradation pathway in eukaryotes, whose network is remarkably dynamic and made of a large number of
compositionally and structurally dynamic machines that orchestrate protein ubiquitination and degradation.
Dysregulation of the UPS has been linked to many human diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative
disorders. Given the clinical success of proteasome inhibitors, the UPS has become an effective platform for
drug discovery. Although basic functions of the UPS are understood, molecular details underlying its multi-layer
regulation and mechanistic action remain elusive. Therefore, elucidating the interaction and structural dynamics
of the UPS network in its physiological context is essential not only for advancing the understanding of UPS
biology, but also for augmenting their therapeutic potential in human health and medicine. In the next five years,
we plan to address several outstanding technological challenges in PPI studies to better decipher the UPS
pathways, by pursuing the following two research directions: 1) Advancing XL-MS technologies for interactomics
and structural proteomics at the systems-level; 2) Mapping the UPS network to uncover molecular details
underlying protein ubiquitination and degradation. Specifically, we will center our efforts on developing novel XL-
MS technologies to enable in-depth and quantitative analysis of proteome networks with structural details and
enhanced spatial resolution to define cellular functional states. In addition, we will employ the newly established
technologies to delineate action mechanisms of proteasome regulators in protein degradation, investigate Cullin-
RING Ligase mediated protein ubiquitination and dissect the organization of the UPS network. Together, these
studies will result in an exciting technological advancement in proteomics research, and facilitate answering

More than 550,000 microsurgery cases are conducted each year in the US to repair tissue following trauma,
cancer, or congenital deficiencies via transplantation of tissue from one part of the body to another (free flaps)
or reattachment of amputated body parts (replantation). The maintenance of patent vascular anastomoses is
critical to the success of any free tissue transfer, and as such, intra- or post- operative thrombosis is the most
feared complication for the surgeon and patient, and is the primary cause of free flap failure. Free flap failure
can lead to re-operations, extended inpatient stay, potentially-devastating functional and cosmetic morbidity, and
increased healthcare costs.3 Despite the advent of improved microsurgical instruments and training programs,
literature reports have indicated that anywhere from 6 to up to 25% of microsurgical cases result in re-operation
due to thrombosis at the microvascular anastomosis site. In each case, microvascular thrombosis caused by
hypercoagulability, blood flow stasis, and vessel wall injury (caused in part by damage to the vessel wall during
the surgical procedure, often using non-absorbable sutures) is the primary cause of failure. The use of sutures
for microvascular anastomosis and their placement directly at the wound site make them an ideal platform for
local, sustained drug delivery (no change in surgical practice and mitigates the risks of systemic drug
administration). We hypothesize that local delivery of anti-thrombotic drugs from sutures directly at the site of
the anastomosis can reduce the rate of thrombosis while securely and reliably connecting all types of vessels.
We describe a novel, highly versatile manufacturing platform capable of producing sutures composed of
hundreds of drug-loaded, polymeric nanofibers. Our preliminary data demonstrates manufacture of microsurgical
sutures capable of surpassing clinical strength specifications when loaded with a wide range of small molecules.
In particular, tacrolimus-eluting sutures demonstrated sustained drug delivery, suitable vascular repair, and safe
and significant inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in comparison to systemic tacrolimus. We believe tacrolimus-
eluting sutures may also have potential to prevent post-operative thrombosis, and have identified additional drug
classes with potential to inhibit thrombosis via multiple mechanisms. Here, we aim to determine which drug class:
anti-coagulant (fondaparinux sodium), anti-platelet (acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel), or anti-inflammatory
(sirolimus, tacrolimus) provides optimal prevention of thrombosis via local drug delivery, and further optimize
formulations and manufacturing parameters to provide optimal drug loading and release. Anti-thrombotic sutures
will be evaluated in rat models of microvascular anastomosis thrombosis, and the most promising candidates
will be tested for safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in a swine free flap model. If successful, our suture
platform could improve outcomes across a range of surgical procedures in microsurgery and beyond."
10895475,"Lack of means to consistently meet basic material needs results in poor health, particularly for those already
managing chronic conditions such as HIV or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although addressing material needs
insecurities likely can be cost-effective by preventing acquisition of or exacerbation of chronic diseases, little is
known about how these material needs work together to harm health. We propose to use an intersectional
perspective and examine the combined effects of four different types of insecurity related to basic material needs
(food, housing, financial, and healthcare) on HIV and CVD outcomes among both men and women. Material-
need insecurities include absolute insufficiency of resources (hunger, homelessness, inadequate finances, no
health insurance), poor quality of resources ((e.g., poor diets, healthcare coverage), uncertainty of consistently
meeting future needs, and having to engage in socially unacceptable means to meet needs. An intersectional
perspective allows us to examine how different combinations of these insecurities affect health in a non-additive
way and may lead to more effective interventions that target co-occurring needs simultaneously, rather than
investing in narrowly focused piecemeal solutions. Specifically, we aim to determine: 1) the separate and
intersectional effects of four specific material-need insecurities (food, housing, financial, and healthcare
insecurity) on HIV and cardiovascular outcomes using latent profile and latent transition analyses; 2) the
intermediate outcomes that may be on causal paths between material-need insecurities and HIV and CVD risk
outcomes using a convergent parallel mixed method design; and 3) factors that moderate effects of material-
need insecurities on HIV and cardiovascular outcomes using convergent parallel mixed methods. We
hypothesize that: 1) intersectional effects will more accurately identify individuals at risk for worse outcomes
compared to independent effects for both HIV-infected and uninfected individuals; 2) relationships of material-
need insecurities with HIV and cardiovascular outcomes are mediated by health behavior (medication non-
adherence, low physical activity, missed clinic visits), mental health (stress, depression, poverty-related stigma),
and physiologic (poor nutrition, inflammation) paths; and 3) inter- and intra-personal resources (e.g., social
support, resilience) mitigate impacts of material-need insecurities. To address these aims, we will leverage the
extensive physical exam, laboratory and survey data from the MACS and WIHS Combined Cohort Study
(MWCCS), and add survey measures and blood collection in a longitudinal five-year study among over 3000
HIV-infected and at-risk MWCCS participants. We will also conduct a longitudinal qualitative study (N = 42) in
three MWCCS sites. Integrating findings from this mixed-methods research will facilitate a deeper understanding
of the experience, distribution, intersections, health implications, and mitigating factors of multiple material-need
insecurities experienced by people living with or at-risk for HIV in the US. Subsequently, we plan to develop
tailored, multi-modal interventions which can target at-risk populations and associated mechanisms."

The Population Research Center (PRC) at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) seeks to renew our P2C
infrastructure funding to continue successful programs and launch new initiatives that will catalyze the next
generation of population dynamics research regarding the social, structural, and contextual processes
underlying population health and health disparities. The PRC serves its faculty scholars through three
established and efficient Cores: An Administrative Core, a Development Core, and a Scientific and Technical
Core. The work of the PRC will be organized around five specific aims: (1) To advance and innovate
population dynamics research through the cultivation of a collaborative and productive intellectual community;
(2) To assist PRC’s faculty scholars in successfully competing for external funding; (3) To provide mentoring,
scaffolding, and prioritization of services that enable Early Stage Investigators to conduct cutting-edge
research and ultimately to achieve research independence; (4) To deliver timely, efficient, and effective pre-
award and post-award administration, computing technology, and statistical supports that allow PRC faculty
scholars to successfully conduct, and disseminate, impactful population dynamics research; and (5) To share
P2C-enabled resources with research community members at other institutions across Texas. PRC faculty
scholars are leading experts in the center’s four Primary Research Areas: Population Health and Well-Being;
Reproductive, Maternal, and Infant Health; Family Demography and Human Development; and Education,
Work, and Institutions. The activities and supports provided by the P2C infrastructure funding will allow PRC
faculty scholars to continue to advance the field’s understanding of what factors promote population health and
what factors undermine health and increase health inequities."
10895911,"African American (AA) men have a >80% higher incidence and are more than twice as likely to die from prostate
cancer (PCa) than white men. The reasons for the high burden relating to poor outcomes of PCa among AA men
are largely unknown. RESPOND is a nation-wide and comprehensive effort to understand PCa health disparities,
with research focused on the role of stress and the contextual environment, access to care and treatment,
inherited susceptibility, tumor somatic genetics, the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, as well as the
integration of these factors in the diagnosis of aggressive disease. AA men, diagnosed with PCa between 2015
and 2020, have been sampled and recruited from cancer registries in 7 states (California, Georgia, Louisiana,
Michigan (Detroit Metropolitan area), New Jersey, Texas, and New York). By December of 2023, the cohort will
include >12,700 AA men with PCa who completed a baseline survey, >7,600 who provided saliva/germline DNA
and tumor samples obtained for >3,400. Over the next 5 years, we will leverage the RESPOND recruitment
infrastructure and research expertise to update comorbidities, lifestyle behaviors, experience of stress, access
to care, and neighborhood environmental data, as well as to obtain information on PCa oncologic outcomes
including disease progression/recurrence (P/R) and mortality. Long-term follow-up of this cohort is essential
since the development of progressive disease may take several years after diagnosis. These data will be used
to address a number of scientific questions and hypotheses aimed at understanding key social and biological
factors and their inter-relationships that contribute to disease P/R and survival in this high-risk population. In Aim
1, we will examine multi-level provider, geospatial and personal factors that define access to care and their
relationship to PCa, P/R and survival as well as patient-reported outcomes. In Aim 2, we will investigate
residence in persistently disinvested neighborhoods and modification by chronic exposure to life-course
structural and social stressors on PCa aggressiveness, P/R and survival. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the impact
of lifestyle factors, comorbid conditions and genetic risk factors on PCa P/R and mortality. Lastly, in Aim 4, we
will leverage deep learning approaches applied to histopathologic images to improve prediction of PCa P/R and
survival in AA men. Each aim addresses a distinct research domain (access to care, social environment/stress,
lifestyle and genetic factors and tumor features), yet, when studied together in a single cohort, scientific synergy
is gained and a far more comprehensive picture of the major factors that contribute to PCa P/R and PCa survival
in AA men. We expect these findings to have broad reaching significance and address numerous challenges in
the clinical management and prevention of P/R in AA men, and ultimately improve health outcomes.
Furthermore, we expect RESPOND to become an invaluable resource for advancing our understanding of the
intersecting multilevel factors contributing to the longstanding high burden of PCa among AA men."

The rotator cuff is composed of 4 muscles that stabilize the shoulder and controls upper arm range of motion. Tears in the
tendons of these muscles, known as rotator cuff tears (RCTs), are among the most common debilitating shoulder injuries. While
RCTs can be surgically repaired, the rate of retear is significant and has been correlated to high levels of rotator cuff muscle fatty
infiltration, fibrosis, and muscle atrophy. A heterogeneous population of muscle resident non-myogenic mesenchymal cells,
known as fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), have been implicated in many skeletal muscle pathologies in which
intramuscular fat and fibrosis are abundant. We and others have recently demonstrated that PDGFRa-expressing FAPs expand
during a 2-week period following massive RCTs in mice and contribute to the accumulation of intramuscular fat and fibrosis that
accompanies rotator cuff muscle atrophy by 8-weeks post injury (wpi). While these findings are important, virtually nothing is
known regarding the molecular signals associated with the promotion of FAP differentiation into fibrogenic and adipogenic fates,
nor the factors that may be secreted by FAPs to drive rotator cuff muscle atrophy following RCT. Utilizing a murine model of
massive RCTs, genetic lineage tracing/reporter analysis, as well as sophisticated bulk RNA-sequencing assays from isolated
FAPs and other gene expression studies in muscle fibers, we identified several important molecular regulators of adipogenesis,
fibrosis, and muscle atrophy that are likely key factors in promoting the RCT pathology. Validation of signaling and functionality
of these molecules/pathways were demonstrated in our mouse model of RCTs (in vivo). In this application we will utilize
conditional genetic approaches to delete the relevant genes specifically in FAPs and muscle fibers following RCTs, while also
performing genetic reporter analysis, histology, IHC/IF, bulk-RNA sequencing, and sophisticated single cell RNA-sequencing
assays, to determine whether cell-type specific signaling activation is necessary to promote the RCT pathology following
massive RCTs in mice and determine whether the presence or absence of these molecular regulators affects FAP heterogeneity
of rotator cuff muscles following RCTs. Further, we will perform proof-of-concept studies demonstrating the utility of prophylactic
and therapeutic pharmacologic approaches to the inhibition of this pathway following RCTs. This work will provide vital
information to our understanding of the cellular and molecular roles for FAPs in RCT induced fatty infiltration, fibrosis, and the
muscle atrophy associated with massive RCTs, while also testing clinically relevant therapies for the treatment of the RCT
pathology."

A diverse U.S. biomedical research workforce is essential for developing innovation in basic, clinical,
translational research and healthcare and is necessary for improving the nation’s health. The proposed
University of California (UC) San Diego Building a Respectful, Inclusive Culture (BRIC) Program will develop
training modules that will catalyze changes in scientific, clinical, and research training environments optimal for
productive learning and research - free from harassment, intimidation, and discrimination - where everyone
feels safe and treated in a respectful and supportive manner. The outcomes of a pilot study of the proposed
training modules, conducted for a small group of faculty, are highly encouraging. The overarching goal of the
UC San Diego BRIC Program is to create a culture of respect, psychological safety and inclusion and support
in the academic environment allowing trainees and learners to work and learn in an environment conducive to
the pursuit of excellence, free of harassment and discrimination. The specific objectives are: 1) to recruit
Health Sciences faculty participants with an emphasis on faculty mentors and researchers that participate in
UC San Diego NIH-supported T32 training programs, including four large NIGMS-supported T32 programs and
other training programs that focus on individuals underrepresented in the biomedical workforce, such as
including the Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) and Institutional Research and Career
Development Award (IRACDA), 2) to train Health Sciences faculty participants using an evidence-based
curriculum tested in our pilot BRIC program to enhance a culture of respect, psychological safety and inclusion
and support, 3) to evaluate the effectiveness of the BRIC program on training environments using a
randomized case/control study design, and 4) to assess the impact of the BRIC program on the Health
Sciences climate. We will integrate instruments measuring psychological safety and inclusion into our
published Health Sciences Faculty Climate Survey and resurvey our faculty at the end of the proposed study.
The UC San Diego BRIC Program is directed by two PIs with a history of mentoring and training. They have
been successful in designing and implementing career development and mentoring programs specifically for
women and individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds. The PIs are both women and one is
from an underrepresented background and have led numerous successful faculty career development
programs and well-respected track record of leading extramurally-funded training programs. The BRIC
Program will be administered centrally through the UC San Diego Health Sciences Office of Faculty Affairs.
The BRIC training modules will be made available to the scientific and educational community, as well as to
the general public."
10885290,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) had been associated with increased risk for
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) through several seminal clinical, molecular and epidemiological studies. Building on
top of the foundation established by these research, two seminal papers reported in Neuron 2018 that
molecular gene networks implicating herpesviruses, such as HHV-6A, HHV-7 and HSV-1, were enriched in
preclinical AD brains. Furthermore, it was shown that HSV-1 infection led to amyloidosis of Amyloid beta (Aβ).
 Since then, our team has been creating and developing novel resources, technologies and collaborations, to
systematically address the role of pathogens (e.g. HSV-1) in AD and AD-related dementias. More specifically,
we used recent human in-vitro induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) based models (e.g. cerebral organoids,
cOrgs), combined with large-scale omics data from human samples (post-mortem brains and CSF antigen
profiling) to identify transcriptomic perturbations by HSV-1 and their association with AD-associated genes.
Given the importance of precision medicine, we will also like to understand if AD-associated host genetics (e.g.
APOE e4) play a role to exacerbate the cell type specific transcriptomic perturbations by HSV-1 in cOrgs.
 Using recent spatial single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies and methods in Aims 1-2, we
will also like to directly evaluate if there are cell types in cOrgs and post-mortem brains targeted by HSV-1 and
other herpesviruses or cell type co-localization differences and cell type specific gene networks that are critical
for AD subtype and outcome analyses. We aim to understand if AD-associated host genetics might play a role
to exacerbate these cell type specific perturbations by HSV-1 in cOrgs and the effects of acyclovir (ACV)
treatment in reversing AD-associated cell type specific gene networks and pathways.
 We have also established high-throughput, scalable and quantitative non-transcriptomics based assays
(ELISA and flow cytometry) to quantify AD-associated readouts (secreted Ab42/40/38 and intracellular Ab42
and phosphorylated Tau-Thr212) to validate our results from the transcriptomics based approaches in Aim 3.
These AD-associated readouts, coupled with the use of flow cytometry results from cell type specific antibody
markers, will enable us to dissect the contribution of cell types to AD and illuminate molecular mechanisms on
how herpesviruses can contribute to AD pathogenesis or disease progression.
 Finally, in Aim 4, we propose to perform data integration of the multi-transcriptomics datasets from human
cOrgs and post-mortem brains with flow cytometry data, as well as previously published large-scale datasets
from post-mortem brains of AD patients, to estimate the population prevalence of AD patient subtypes whose
etiology may be triggered by herpesviral infections and who may benefit from early anti-herpetic treatment.
Our research has broad implications to pave the path for future research and development into
precision medicine for a subset of AD patients whose pathogenesis might arise from herpesviruses."

Millions of Americans are exposed daily to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to the current and
historical use of these chemicals in consumer and industrial products. PFAS exposure in humans is associated
with liver disease and serum hyperlipidemia (increased serum cholesterol, in particular). However, understanding
the mechanism(s) linking PFAS exposure to dyslipidemia is hindered by 1) the ability of PFAS to activate
peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), a receptor activated by fibrate drugs that reduces serum
triacylglycerides, 2) apparently disparate effects of PFAS on serum lipids in human and rodents (in which PFAS
can decrease serum lipids), 3) lack of understanding if/how PFAS congeners exert distinct effects on lipid
homeostasis, and 4) species differences in nuclear receptors that regulate PFAS-induced effects. Our
overarching objective is to determine the mechanisms by which PFAS disrupt systemic lipid homeostasis. Our
research focuses on nuclear receptors that are activated by PFAS and are directly involved in lipid regulation:
PPARα, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and pregnane X receptor (PXR). PPARα activation decreases
hepatic and serum lipids while CAR and PXR activation can have the opposite effect. There are two major
chemical classes of PFAS: perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (PFSA). We
used a human-relevant model in vitro to show that PFCA and PFSA activate human PPARα (huPPARα) with
differing efficacies. Using mice expressing huPPARα and fed an American diet, we showed that: 1)
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) activates hepatic huPPARα in vivo at body burdens found in humans, 2) CAR
and PXR also are strongly activated, 3) PFOA increases liver lipids and serum cholesterol, and 4) PFOA’s effects
are sex-dependent. Given the strength of the PFAS-induced CAR/PXR signal, the potential for CAR/PXR to
differentiate the effects of PFCAs and PFSAs, and that CAR/PXR also are activated in a species-specific manner,
we propose that the most human relevant in vivo model should be multi-humanized. Thus, our Specific Aims are
as follows. In Aim 1, we will refine our novel mouse model to investigate human relevant mechanisms of PFAS
action by incorporating human CAR (huCAR) and PXR (huPXR) into the huPPARα mouse and update our novel
“What we eat in America” diet. In Aim 2, we will test the contribution of huPPARα to PFAS-induced toxicological
effects in vivo in the context of huCAR and huPXR by comparing effects in huPPARα+:huCAR+:huPXR+ and
PPARαNull(mouse/human):huCAR+:huPXR+ mice exposed to human-relevant PFAS levels. We will test the hypotheses
that a) activation of PPARα by PFAS limits their capacity to stimulate hepatic steatosis and serum hyperlipidemia
by counteracting effects of CAR/PXR activation and b) PFAS structure will determine the balance of
huPPARα:huCAR/huPXR activation resulting in differences in toxicological effects. Results will fill critical gaps
by generating an in vivo, human-relevant model to investigate PFAS-induced, clinically-relevant disease and
providing novel insights into the mechanisms of action of PFAS in liver and intestine."
10897716,"This is a resubmission of the third competing continuation application of T32 HL082610, “Translational
Research Training in Sleep and Circadian Science,” currently in Month 50 of our third 5-year grant period. The
broad aim of this program is to train the next generation of clinical, basic, and population scientists in a
translational approach to sleep and circadian science. This T32 is the nidus for sleep and circadian research
training at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), attracting additional postdoctoral and graduate student trainees
from other Pitt programs. Our T32 has enjoyed considerable success: 72% of 40 appointed and affiliated
postdocs submitted F/K/CDA applications, 70% of these received awards, and 85% hold faculty or training
positions. Our 29 medical students have submitted 17 abstracts and published 14 peer-reviewed papers. For the
next 5-year period, we propose to deepen our focus on multidimensional sleep and circadian health (MSCH)—
specifically, on its health consequences and mechanisms, and on interventions to improve MSCH. Our
philosophy is that effective training in sleep and circadian science is multidisciplinary, translational, evidence-
based, milestone driven, and socially conscious. Guided by this philosophy, our training program includes: A
primary focus on mentored research with experienced, well-funded sleep medicine investigators; team
mentoring, and careful evaluation of mentor and mentee progress; didactic work including core competencies
in sleep and circadian research methods, critical appraisal of the literature, professional development,
responsible conduct of research, and rigor and reproducibility; measurable outcomes, including trainee
publications, presentations, and grant applications; individual and group instruction in the preparation of
career development and other award applications; individually-prescribed formal coursework; and access to
the rich training and research resources at Pitt, including the Clinical and Translational Science Institute
(CTSI). The training program will include 3 components: 1) Continuing the 2-3 year postdoctoral training
fellowship for nationally-recruited physician scientists and PhDs (4 trainees per year). 2) Continuing the short-
term research program for medical students (4 trainees per year). 3) Adding a new 2-3 year training
program for nationally-recruited predoctoral students in accredited Pitt graduate programs (e.g., psychology,
neuroscience, epidemiology, health and physical activity) (4 students over 5 years). This new predoctoral
program will formalize and provide a consistent support mechanism for the graduate student training we have
already been conducting. We have systematically evaluated our program with our trainees, University Advisory
Board, and External Advisory Board. Based on these evaluations, we propose to further strengthen the program
with targeted recruitment efforts to increase the number of trainees from groups that are underrepresented in
biomedical research; a focus on health disparities in research; enhanced mentor training; and instruction
organized around the characteristics of a translational scientist."

Surgeon-scientists are an underrepresented population in academic medicine, and federally funded physician-
scientist-led research has been in decline over the past decade. Substantial challenges are faced by surgical
trainees seeking research training. Importantly, surgical resident training programs with ample protected time for
dedicated experiential research training have effectively contributed to the “pipeline” of successful, independently
funded surgeon scientists. These researchers have meaningfully impacted surgical oncology patient care and
scientific knowledge. Moreover, there are few opportunities for PhD postdoctoral fellows to work at the
intersection of surgery and oncology. The proposed COllaborative Northwestern Surgical Oncology Research
Training (CONSORT) program brings together the extensive multidisciplinary oncologic expertise at
Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine (NUFSM) and the Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center
to create a multidisciplinary, two-year research training program consisting of (1) a Health Services and
Outcomes Research (HSOR) Track and (2) a Basic Science and Translational (BTS) Research Track. The
CONSORT program will draw upon the Northwestern Department of Surgery’s 30-year experience of training in
BTS oncology research and the 15-year surgical oncology HSOR resident training collaboration between the
Northwestern Institute for Comparative Effectiveness Research in Oncology (NICER-Onc), the HSOR
Postdoctoral Fellowship at Northwestern, and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Cancer Programs. Since
2009, we have trained 44 surgical research trainees who have gone on to oncology-focused academic careers.
During a two-year, intensive training period (100% protected time), trainees in the CONSORT program will be
immersed in multidisciplinary, experiential research training, using a team science approach, with tailored
mentorship and focused didactic teaching (Master’s degree for those without prior advanced degrees). Each
trainee will have an experienced and diverse Mentor Team (content and methodological experts), tailored to their
training needs. The CONSORT program core curriculum will include courses in study design and analytic
approaches, best practices and ethics in research, and career development. Trainees will participate in the
workshops, seminars, and research training opportunities at Northwestern and at relevant surgical and oncologic
professional societies. Trainees will design and execute research projects that culminate in presentations at
major national conferences and publications in high-impact journals. Continuous monitoring and iterative
program improvement will be achieved by engagement of a highly accomplished External Advisory Committee
and robust evaluation by Northwestern’s Searle Center for Advanced Learning and Teaching. The ultimate goal
of the CONSORT program is to increase the number of investigators who successfully achieve academic careers
as independently funded surgical oncologic scientists. Northwestern is uniquely positioned to assure the success
of the CONSORT program and continuing to develop future surgical oncology scientist leaders and mentors."
10897739,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA methylation is a major epigenetic modification that plays an important role in key biological processes,
including genomic imprinting, X-chromosome inactivation, suppression of transposable elements, and
carcinogenesis. Although it has been traditionally considered to be restricted to CpG dinucleotides in metazoan
genomes, emerging evidence over the past decade has shown that CpH (H=A/C/T) methylation is present in
mammalian genomes, including cultured pluripotent stem cells, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem
cells, the mouse germ line, and especially at a relatively high level in human and mouse brains. Given that
CpGs only represent 4% of the metazoan genomes, CpH methylation greatly expands the proportion of the
genome that is subject to regulation by cytosine methylation and represents a new mechanism of
transcriptional regulation. In our previous studies, we generated neuronal DNA methylation profiles at a single
base-resolution of the adult mouse dentate gyrus in which 80-90% of the cells are NeuN positive granule
neurons, and our team was one of the first to show that ~25% of cytosine methylations are located in the CpH
context. Notably, we identified the first mCpH reader, MeCP2, both in vitro and in postmitotic neurons in vivo.
In addition, we found that CpH methylation was established postnatally and required DNMT3A for its active
maintenance in neurons in vivo. Mutations on both the reader and writer lead to neurodevelopmental disorders,
such as fragile X syndrome (FXS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Rett syndrome. Loss of either
Dnmt3A or MeCP2 in the mouse models causes overlapping and distinct phenotypes in behavioral and
molecular tests, suggesting the existence of additional mCpH-binding proteins. We believe that a critical step
towards understanding the biological functions of mCpH is to identify its binding proteins. In this proposal, our
goal is to identify additional mCpH binding proteins. We hypothesize that mCpH regulates transcription directly
or indirectly via recruiting sequence-independent and/or -dependent mCpH-binding proteins in neurons. We
will use protein array (Aim 1) and Digital Affinity Profiling via Proximity Ligation (DAPPL; Aim 2) to identify
sequence-independent and -dependent mCpH-binding proteins and validate candidates using gel-shift
(EMSA), OCTET and luciferase assays in vitro. We will employ a viral in vivo delivery system and high-
throughput sequencing technologies to characterize their roles in transcriptional and chromatin regulation in
the adult mouse brain (Aim 3). The effectiveness of our strategy will be rigorously evaluated via a series of in
vitro and in vivo assays. If funded, the success of this project is expected to provide a rich resource of
sequence-dependent and independent mCpH-binding proteins that will lay the foundation to elucidate the roles
of CpH methylation in neurons, stem cells and other tissues. The insights into the mechanism of CpH
methylation is expected to provide novel drug targets for treating neurodevelopmental disorders."
10893793,"Project Summary/Abstract
Centromeres remain perhaps the most enigmatic regions of the genome, even though they provide the
foundation for chromosome segregation during every eukaryotic cell division. Despite the “complete sequencing”
of the human genome more than a decade ago, it was only recently that the first assembly of a human centromere
was completed. In addition, due to the highly repetitive nature of the centromere sequences in humans and most
other organisms, data from centromeres is excluded from almost all genome-wide studies that typically require
sequencing reads to map to a single locus. If we are to truly understand the genome, it is critical to address this
important gap in our understanding to reveal the nature of centromeres. Breaking through these challenges
requires a unique conceptual framework and set of tools and technologies that combine genome technologies
(such as longer sequencing read lengths), computational and bioinformatics approaches, and together with
complementary functional biological studies.
The goal of the Centromere Biology conference is to substantially advance our understanding of the centromere
regions of each chromosome by convening researchers of diverse disciplines focusing on this genomic locus.
This meeting will bring together a diverse group of outstanding scientists to build a community interested in
understanding diverse aspects of centromere properties including the sequence, nature, organization, evolution
(including sequence diversity across the human population), and function of this incredibly important and unique
genomic locus. Speakers will represent the diversity of disciplines that this community attracts including
genomics, bioinformatics, genetics, epigenetics, biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, cell and molecular
biology, as well as theory and modeling. We value this meeting as part of a larger effort to build an inclusive and
diverse the centromere community, including strong representation from women and early career researchers."

coordinating all communications and reviewing all activities among all Projects and all Cores. Importantly,
the AC will work closely with the EC and Cores to coordinate generation, maintenance, and experimental
use of human cell and mouse models that will optimize experimental design, use of these resources, and
integration of all Projects and Cores to efficiently accelerate the Program towards completion of its goals.
The aims of the Core are to: 1) Promote collaboration and integration of the Program by providing
organizational and administrative support; 2) Facilitate scientific exchange, dissemination of results, and
communications; 3) Evaluate and promote research progress; 4) Provide managerial and fiscal grant
management; and 5) Ensure and monitor best practices, resource utilization and coordination. The Core will
promote best practices for rigor and responsibility, animal and human subjects research, responsible
conduct of research, and mentoring and coaching of early stage investigators. The AC will monitor
Projects and Scientific Cores and assure that sex as a biological variable has been addressed. In
summary, the Administrative Core will function to unify and coordinate activities amongst the Program
Project participants. It will facilitate organizational and administrative management of the Program,
provide centralized access and coordination for cell and mouse experiment planning, and enhance
significance, scope and scale of the projects. The services of this core do not replicate efforts of
established cores at Cleveland Clinic, making this core uniquely designed to support P01 investigators."
10896381,"SC3 PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and a major risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and
stroke. Incidence of AF is further increasing due to the rise in obesity and age of the population, factors closely
related to AF risk and progression. Despite significant advances in AF diagnosis and management, treatment
and clinical outcomes remain poor and more than a decade has passed since the last AF drug discovery. The
overall goal of this PPG application is to use genomic and transcriptomic findings to identify preventative and
therapeutic strategies for AF and develop them towards clinical application. Our central hypothesis is that
increasing our knowledge about molecular mechanisms involved in genetic, transcriptomic, metabolic and
structural changes in the atria will allow us to pinpoint possible targets for safer and more effective therapeutic
strategies. To help the projects advance towards these goals, the Network and Systems Biology Core (SC3)
will be responsible for the processing, analysis, integration and network modeling of all RNA sequencing data,
including bulk and single nuclei, proteomic, metabolomics, and functional assay data used and generated in
the four projects. All Projects have proposed extensive use of RNA sequencing studies, making SC3 integral
to their success. Functional assay data will be generated primarily in SC1 and SC2 under direction of the
Projects and then sent to SC3 for analysis and integration with RNASeq. SC3 will work closely with the project
leads and personnel to help interpret and visualize the results including those from traditional differential
analyses as well as from more advanced network and systems biology approaches. SC3 has a unique blend of
expertise and experience, combining personnel with RNA processing and modeling skills and those with a
network and systems biology focus, which together with a rigorous and reproducible pipeline implementation
will help enable the four projects in this PPG to fill knowledge gaps and make advances towards understanding
and treating atrial fibrillation. SC3 will provide two major groups of services to the PPG organized around the
type of data being analyzed. Aim 1 will focus on services for RNA sequencing data, including advanced
network and systems biology approaches, while Aim 2 will focus on services for functional assay data as well
as integrations with the RNA data."
10896383,"Project 1 Summary:
Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases risk of heart failure, stroke and death, and its incidence increases with age and
obesity. Human genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ~140 genetic loci associated with
AF susceptibility, but it still takes dedicated functional and molecular studies to identify the causal gene, the
causal genetic variant, and the mechanisms for AF association. We are very excited to pursue two AF risk loci
on chromosomes 10q22 (SYNPO2L and MYOZ1 genes) and 14q23 (SYNE2 gene). We are poised to discover
the mechanism by which these two loci increase AF susceptibility, and identify gene centric repurposable
drugs, which may be targeted to individuals carrying these risk alleles. We chose both loci for study as the
GWAS single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with expression of a nearby gene; thus, the
causal SNP, which can be in linkage disequilibrium with the GWAS SNP, may work by regulating gene
expression. These associations with gene expression were for specific transcript isoforms of SYNPO2L and
SYNE2 due to alternative transcription start sites. In Aim 1, we will study the complex AF locus on
chromosome 10q22, where the AF risk allele is associated with decreased expression of MYOZ1, but
increased expression of the shorter isoforms of SYNPO2L. Both of these genes encode Z disk proteins, which
may directly affect contractility and secondarily alter Ca2+ handling that may impact cellular electrophysiology.
We will study how changes in the expression of MYOZ1 and the SYPO2L isoforms alter contractility and
electrophysiology in human stem cells differentiated into atrial-like cardiomyocytes (a-iCMs) and engineered
heat tissue (EHT). In Aim 2, we will build on our preliminary human iCM studies, where we found that the
chromosome 14q23 AF risk allele is associated with less expression of a SYNE2 short isoform. SYNE2
encodes a protein that connects the nucleus to the cytoplasm, but the short isoform does not bind to the
cytoskeleton, and acts as a dominant negative to disrupt the nuclear-cytoplasm connection. RNAseq from
SYNE2 short isoform overexpression in a-iCMs showed a large effect on Ca2+ handling proteins. We looked at
Ca2+ handling and action potentials; knockdown of all SYNE2 isoforms led to increased early
afterdepolarizations, which was rescued by over expression of the short isoform. Short isoform over expression
also decreased peak Ca2+ content. We discovered that the SYNE2 short isoform also binds to the
sarcoplasmic reticulum. In this aim we are poised to determine if over expression of the SYNE2 short isoform
can protect against AF in a mouse model of spontaneous AF. In collaboration with SC3 and P3, Aim 3 will use
the RNAseq data from Aims 1 and 2 to identify “gene effect modules”, for which we will identify module altering
repurposalbe drugs, which will be tested for beneficial effects in a-iCMs and EHTs. Successful completion of
our aims will make significant contributions to AF functional genomics and therapeutics."
10896385,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) risk is increased by a variety of cardiovascular stressors, including obesity, hypertension,
coronary or valve disease, heart failure, metabolic syndrome, sleep apnea, excessive alcohol, and extreme
exertion. AF is a progressive condition, and risk of stroke and other complications increases with increasing AF
burden. Identification of drugs or interventions that can slow or reverse the progression of AF would have a
significant clinical impact. In RNA sequencing studies, we have identified mitochondrial dysfunction and
oxidative phosphorylation pathways among the most prominent pathways associated with development of
persistent AF. In Project 2, Genes and Metabolism: Targeting Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Atrial Fibrillation
(P2), our central hypothesis is that metabolic stressors and aging increase mitochondrial oxidant production,
promoting atrial mitochondrial DNA damage, dysfunction and metabolic heterogeneity. We hypothesize that
metabolic heterogeneity underlies electrical instability, and that interventions that promote mitochondrial
resilience and limit metabolic heterogeneity will reduce atrial ectopy and slow AF progression. We propose two
specific aims. Aim 1 seeks to evaluate the role of metabolic stressors on an in vitro model of engineered heart
tissues (EHTs), derived from atrial-like cardiac myocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem
cells. We will study the transcriptional and functional impact of 4 distinct metabolic stressors relevant to the
etiology of AF on EHT cellular composition and mitochondrial, contractile and electrical function of human atrial
EHTs. Stressors include: chronic exposure to isoproterenol, palmitate, ethanol and endothelin-1; the same
stressors will be used to test the protective effect of metabolic/mitochondrial targeted drugs in EHTs. In Aim 2,
we will evaluate the metabolic mechanisms that underlie progression of AF in the heterozygous CREM-IbCX
transgenic mouse model of spontaneous AF and AF progression, employing a high fat diet as a metabolic
stress with which we can study the functional and transcriptomic impact of obesity on the development and
rate of progression of AF. We hypothesize that progression of AF in this model is also caused by mitochondrial
dysfunction, resulting in metabolic, transcriptional and electrophysiologic dysfunction. We thus propose that
obese mice will develop AF more quickly, earlier, and with a greater burden than in lean transgenic mice.
Finally, using obese transgenic mice, we will evaluate the impact of drugs that protected EHTs from
mitochondrial dysfunction and downstream effects, to determine if these drugs can slow the development and
progression of AF. We expect both the atrial EHT and obese CREM-IbCX mouse models will be useful for
preclinical testing of new and existing metabolic drugs that can improve AF treatment and slow its progression.
This project is highly collaborative with the other PPG projects, and will contribute to the overall goal of this
PPG to advance therapies that can slow the progression and reduce the burden of atrial fibrillation."
10896387,"PROJECT 3 - Genes to Omics-Informed Drugs: Drug Repositioning and Functional Testing to Prevent
AF Progression
PROJECT SUMMARY
An important clinical problem in atrial fibrillation (AF) is preventing AF from progressing to more persistent
forms. After an initial episode, AF recurs with increase in burden occurring in ~50% and progression to
persistent or permanent AF occurring in 25% within 5 years of diagnosis. Compared to paroxysmal AF,
prognosis is poorer and outcomes after medical or ablation therapy are worse for patients with persistent or
permanent AF. While many processes and pathways have been implicated in AF development and to a lesser
extent progression, the precise molecular drivers, their interactions and context in which they act are not fully
understood. Genetic risk factors for development of AF may differ from those promoting progression of AF,
which may also be impacted by environmental, comorbid or cellular stressors. We hypothesize that an
interplay between AF progression and gene regulatory and interactome networks can be identified and that
understanding these mechanisms is essential to informing therapeutic discovery for AF progression. Our goal
is to identify AF progression genes, pathways and modules that will enable identification and then validation of
repurposable drugs for the prevention of AF and AF progression. To find drugs to target progression of AF, we
must first better understand the molecular components of AF progression. This project builds upon our prior
RNA sequencing (RNASeq) data in human left atrial (LA) appendage (LAA) tissues that showed altered,
inadequate or overwhelmed transcriptomic responses to cell stress pathways occur with progression to
persistent AF. We propose to integrate single-nucleus transcriptomics (snRNASeq) in human LA tissue to
identify master transcription factor (TF)- and interactome-mediated gene regulatory networks and cell types
underlying AF disease progression, overcoming a limitation of bulk RNASeq data that cannot resolve changes
from differing cell composition, such as fibroblasts, which may increase with AF progression. snRNASeq will
yield further insights into AF progression and specific cell types related to progression. We will also use human
interactome network approaches to identify novel risk genes and disease modules that change with AF
progression. We will then integrate interactome, genetic, and AF progression genomic, proteomic and
metabolomics data using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to identify therapeutic targets for AF progression
and repurposable drugs and drug combinations targeting AF progression. ‘Omic data from other projects in the
Program will also be integrated that may yield potential gene or pathway specific candidate drugs. Candidate
drugs and combinations will then be functionally tested in human engineered heart tissues (EHTs) and relevant
mouse models of spontaneous AF and AF progression. Our focus on identifying repurposable drugs will
shorten the time to testing for AF. Successful completion of this Project will provide insights into the molecular
mechanisms of AF progression; a pipeline for drug identification, functional testing and validation for AF and
AF progression; and importantly, drugs ready for clinical testing."
10896388,"Summary:
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is multifactorial and acquired factors, such as obesity, alcohol abuse, and heart failure,
contribute to its pathogenesis. Moreover, despite the use of anticoagulants to prevent left atrial thrombosis,
patients with AF are still at risk for ischemic stroke or the complications of anticoagulation. Our inability to
manage AF with available tools emphasizes the critical need to search for novel treatment pathways that target
its underlying mechanisms. Over the past several years the gut microbiome has been linked to atherosclerotic
disease by gut microbiota catabolism of dietary choline to trimethylamine (TMA) which is further oxidized in the
liver by flavin monooxygenase to trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO). Elevated plasma TMAO levels
independently predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and have been mechanistically linked to
atherosclerotic disease by (i) increasing endothelial inflammation by priming and activating the NOD-, LRR-
and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome by the production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species, (ii) increasing adiposity by regulating white adipose tissue, and (iii) enhancing thrombosis by
activating platelets. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been linked to the pathogenesis of AF in animal models,
obesity is a major risk factor for AF, and enhancement of thrombosis by TMAO may increase AF patients’
susceptibility to stroke. We have gathered preliminary data demonstrating that (i)TMAO independently
associates with prevalent and incident AF, (ii)TMAO may prime the NLRP3 inflammasome in atrial-like induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (a-iCMs), (iii) TMAO blunts the atrial action potential in ex vivo
mouse hearts in a gut microbiota dependent manner, and (iv) TMAO reduces the resting potential and
shortens the duration and decreases the peak amplitude of the action potential in a-iCMS. These data suggest
TMAO may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF by causing metabolic and electrophysiological dysfunction in
cardiomyocytes, thereby promoting AF. In this project, we propose to investigate the mechanisms underlying
the association of TMAO and the gut microbiome with AF. Aim 1 will investigate the role of the gut microbiome
in AF susceptibility. We will first suppress the entire gut microbiota with broad spectrum antibiotics using AF
susceptible mice on and off a choline diet and monitor for the progression of AF. We then will use a pathway
specific inhibitor, fluoromethylcholine (FMC), to demonstrate that choline metabolism to TMAO is specifically
promoting AF. In a final set of studies, we will confirm the role of the gut microbiota in AF by performing fecal
transplants to determine if susceptibility to AF is a transmissible trait. The second aim will investigate
mechanisms by which TMAO promote AF. The first subaim will explore the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in
the TMAO-promoted susceptibility to AF, fibrosis, and left atrial thrombosis. The second sub aim will explore
the role of TMAO in causing electrophysiological dysfunction in ex vivo mouse atrial studies and in atrial
engineered heart tissue. Together these studies may link together the diet, the gut microbiome, and AF."

Molecular Characterization Trial
Navigating Extended Specimen Surveys for Therapeutic Selection (ROBIN-NESSTS)
Summary: Approximately half of all cancer patients are treated with radiation in the course of their disease.
There exists an opportunity and urgent need to apply new biological knowledge in the optimization of radiation
treatment and its combination with emerging targeted anti-neoplastic agents. At the core of the CCF/Emory
ROBIN U54 Center is a branched Molecular Characterization Trial (MCT) focused on longitudinal collection of
biospecimens and multimodal data from patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) prior to-, during, and after radiotherapy. These molecular
characterization cohorts have been designed to incorporate immunomodulatory combination therapies as well
as standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy, aiming to address pressing translational questions by integrating
these trials throughout the ROBIN Center’s cores and projects. These are immune radiobiology-centered
“small N, high-content” study cohorts that will allow us to address critical knowledge gaps related to the
biological basis responses to combined modality radiotherapy. The central hypothesis being tested is that the
longitudinal collection of clinically annotated biospecimens and multimodal data from patients treated prior to,
during, and after radiotherapy from MCT cohorts examining radiation-based immunotherapies and standard of
care chemoradiation will provide new insights into the genetic, immunologic, and evolutionary basis of
therapeutic response. The ability to interrogate key questions across two distinct cancers will amplify our
capacity to identify generalizable molecular mechanisms underlying radiation resistance and
immunomodulatory activity. Our Specific Aims are to conduct a specimen collection and characterization trial
with 2 cohorts: (1) (MCTa): Adaptive RADiation therapy with concurrent Sacituzumab Govitecan (RAD-SG) for
bladder preservation in patients with MIBC and (2) a Phase II trial of IMRT re-irradiation plus concurrent and
adjuvant nivolumab. The same sample and data acquisition will be obtained from two parallel cohorts of
standard of care cisplatin plus RT treated patients (n=20 for each site). The overarching objective of the high-
content study cohorts in this MCT is to rigorously dissect common mechanisms and drivers of efficacy and
resistance to the most promising radiation-based combinations in two cancers. We will address knowledge
gaps related to the genetic, immunologic, and molecular evolutionary basis of response to immunomodulatory
combination therapies by seamlessly integrating multi-modal data from these clinical cohorts across the
ROBIN Center’s laboratories, projects, and cores."
10896483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research Project 1
 An organ sparing standard-of-care for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) involves
concurrent chemotherapy plus radiation (RT). However, even after receiving current therapies (surgery or
chemoradiation), bladder preservation and overall survival remains low, at approximately 50-60%. The
molecular pathogenesis of bladder cancer and the mechanisms of resistance to chemoradiation remain poorly
understood. Our long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms of efficacy and resistance of bladder cancer
to radiation plus sacituzumab or cisplatin and to use this information to develop better therapeutic modalities
for bladder cancer patients. Perhaps one of most promising immunomodulatory biologicals used with radiation
is the antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) is an antibody drug conjugate that
combines the anti-TROP2 antibody with an active metabolite of irinotecan. ADCs act by inducing tumor cell
damage as well as immune activation. The central hypothesis of this application is that specific genetic and
immune determinants underlie sensitivity and resistance to radiation-based combination therapies with SG
ADC versus cisplatin in MIBC patients. Our hypothesis has been formulated based on strong preliminary data
from our group. We plan to accomplish our objectives with 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the
genetic and microenvironmental mechanisms that drive efficacy and resistance to combined sacituzumab plus
radiation therapy in bladder cancer. The working hypothesis here is that combinations of distinct tumor
determinants, such as somatic mutations in DDR genes, and microenvironmental features, may be important
for the anti-tumor effects of RT+SG. We will systematically elucidate the molecular, genetic, and immunologic
effects of treatment with standard-of-care radiation + cisplatin versus radiation + ADC. We will also utilize
single cell sequencing to reveal treatment-related changes in the tumor ecosystem in MIBC undergoing each
approach. In Aim 2, we will characterize tumor clonal dynamics, immune repertoire editing, and imaging
changes following treatment with sacituzumab plus radiation. We postulate that ADC therapy may induce
sculpting of both the tumor clonal variants and the immune microenvironment and associate with an improved
response to radiation treatment. We will reveal adaptive changes to radiation + cisplatin versus radiation +
ADC using comprehensive genomic, transcriptional, and immunologic profiling. We will integrate the temporal
kinetics of tumor clonality and immune repertoire editing with tumor genomics and imaging. In Aim 3, we will
examine the mechanisms of acquired resistance to radiation plus cisplatin versus radiation plus sacituzumab.
We will uncover the differential effects of these two treatment approaches, systematically characterize
emergence of driver mutations, changes in the tumor clonal composition, immune reprogramming, and identify
molecular and cellular mechanisms of acquired resistance."
10896485,"SUMMARY
Radiation therapy (RT) is the single most utilized anti-cancer agent; nearly 70% of all cancer patients will receive
radiation at some point in their cancer journey, and RT plays a crucial role in almost half of all cancer cures. The
sequencing of the human genome, completed nearly 20 years ago, followed by the large scale cancer
sequencing effort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have provided an unprecedented understanding of
cancers in the primary and metastatic setting. In those same years, medical oncology has undergone three major
phase transitions: targeted therapies have changed the way we think many diseases with specific actionable
mutations; immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many of those without; and antibody-drug
conjugates have increased the specificity of our cytotoxics. RT treatment decision making, however, has not
seen these same changes from biological influences, instead having relied on advances in medical physics and
computer science to drive our advances. While the number of trials has ballooned in radiation oncology of late,
spurred on by encouragement, and funding, from pharmaceutical companies interested in the synergy between
novel (and profitable) compounds in the form of immune checkpoint inhibitors and antibody-drug-conjugates,
with radiation, our understanding of the relative benefits and best choices for individual patients has not seen
the same increases. In fact, we have struggled to parse out the differences between these novel combinations
and standard chemoradiotherapy in phase II trials, largely because of the combinatorial nature of our trials, and
the sheer number of open questions. In this project, we seek to make headway toward personalizing radiation
therapy treatment choices. Using our experience in using gene signatures to predict individual patient radiation
benefit, together with expertise in radiomics and genomics, we will use 4 carefully crafted cohorts to dissect out
the relative contribution of radiation, standard chemotherapy, the immune checkpoint inhibitor Nivolumab and
the antibody-drug conjugate Sacituzumab govitecan. Having chosen two disease sites which benefit from high
(but not uniform) cure rates with standard cisplatin-radiation combination therapy (bladder and head and neck),
we have structured two investigational trials to compare to standard therapy. In each trial (bladder, with SG+RT,
and HNSCC with ICI+RT) we will compare and contrast the temporal changes in tumor transcriptomic and
mutational state change in primary tumor tissue and surrogates from shed cells and circulating tumor DNA. The
‘ground truth’ of these genomics through time will be married to high temporal density radiomics features to allow
for translation and generalization to all patients treated with modern technique. Through these complimentary -
omic modalities, we aim to leverage our experience in creating signatures of therapeutic response to admit
personalized treatment choice in the up front setting, and opportunities to change course using real-time
information gleaned from daily imaging. To round out the project we will perform in vitro experimental evolution
to uncover the molecular mechanisms underpinning therapeutic success and failure in each modality, and to
derive signatures of alternative therapy sensitivity."
10896486,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research Project 3
 Approximately 75% of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients are treated with
radiation therapy, highlighting the significance of this treatment modality for HNSCC. Unfortunately, 30-40% of
HNSCC patients recur locoregionally due to radioresistance. Due to limited available data derived from intact
human tumors, the biological determinants of how HNSCC respond and adapt to radiation therapy and its
combination with chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy are not well understood. Thus, there is an urgent need
to elucidate the biological basis of how patients respond to radiation-based therapies so that this knowledge can
be exploited to improve eradication of HNSCC and mitigate toxicity to normal tissues. This proposal will leverage
the longitudinal collection of biospecimens and multimodal data from both a completed and proposed Molecular
Characterization Trial of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) re-irradiation with concurrent and adjuvant
cisplatin or nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with locoregionally recurrent HNSCC. Radiation therapy
works, at least in part, by damaging DNA and activating the immune system. The DNA damage response (DDR)
plays a critical role in this nexus by governing the resistance of HNSCC to radiation therapy and to immune
checkpoint inhibition (ICI). Significantly, DDR genes are frequently altered in HNSCC. Our preliminary data
suggest: 1) a dynamic regulation of radiation resistance by the DDR, 2) DDR dysregulation is associated with
improved ICI response due to increased tumor mutational burden and alterations in intra-tumoral immune
populations, 3) presence of a unique tumor antigen-specific progenitor CD8+ T-cell subset (PD-1+ TCF-1+) in
HNSCC, which may be stimulated to differentiate into terminal effectors capable of tumor killing by enhanced neo-
antigen presentation by APCs that is further driven by DDR dysregulation. However, the precise mechanisms by
which DDR directs these immunologic dynamics and response to radiation with ICI are unclear. We hypothesize
that key DDR driver proteins govern the intrinsic to acquired resistance of HNSCC to radiation therapy with
chemotherapy and/or ICI. We propose to: 1) Elucidate the genetic and microenvironmental factors that govern
response and resistance to radiation therapy with chemotherapy versus radiation therapy with ICI in HNSCC, 2)
Delineate the molecular mechanisms by which the DDR directs immunological dynamics underlying therapy
response to radiation with ICI, 3) Determine the molecular mechanisms driving acquired resistance in HNSCC
treated with radiation therapy plus ICI versus cisplatin. Completion of this work will elucidate the unique genetic
and microenvironmental factors governing the continuum of intrinsic to acquired resistance of HNSCC to
radiation therapy with chemotherapy versus radiation therapy with ICI, provide a detailed mechanistic
understanding of how key DDR driver proteins govern resistance of HNSCC to radiation therapy with
chemotherapy and/or ICI, and provide new insights into how the DDR directs immunological response dynamics
in response to radiation therapy with ICI."

Cross-Training Core
Cancer is a major public health problem worldwide and is the second leading cause of death in the US.
Advances in our understanding of the biology of cancer have the potential to lead to significant breakthroughs
in cancer diagnosis, detection, and treatment. However, the translation of basic science discoveries to clinical
advancements has been slow and inefficient. The translation of molecular insights from the lab to clinical trials
and ultimately to clinical practice relies on the close collaboration of scientists (radiation biologist and medical
physicist) and physicians (radiation oncologist) with diverse training backgrounds. A major barrier to the
integration of these basic scientists and physicians in translational settings is the lack of enhanced mentored
training opportunities focused on radiation biology workforce development. To address the urgent need for
well-trained independent investigators in cancer research who can bridge the gap between scientific discovery
and clinical advancement, we propose the Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF)-Emory Cross-Training Program
in ROBIN that will take advantage of the outstanding resources, high caliber of investigators, and close
collaboration between cancer biologists, clinicians and physicists at the Cleveland Clinic Case Comprehensive
Cancer Center and Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. The CCF/Emory Cross-Training Core will
provide a unique, individualized, and multi-faceted cross-training experience to support the development of
trainees (PhD and/or MD) in acquiring the knowledge and skills to address the most important biological
questions and clinically significant problems so that they can make transformative discoveries to improve
quality of care for patients with cancer. The primary objective of the Cross-Training Core is to develop and
sustain a collaborative environment that encourages the center membership to increase interactions, sharing,
and rapid adoption of concepts and approaches. The cross-training core will establish and accelerate
advances from projects to paradigms by providing training and expertise with an overall trajectory that
promotes wider adoption by the oncology community to improve patient outcomes. We will operationalize the
mission of the cross-training core through integrated training opportunities for radiation biologists, medical
physicists, and radiation oncologists with the goal of engaging trainees in research across the ROBIN Center’s
multiple cores and projects. Building on a strong existing culture of education and training, we propose the
following specific aims: (1) Develop a centralized radiation biology integration network to facilitate scientific
cross-pollination between radiation oncology, radiation biology, and medical physics within the ROBIN Center;
(2) Disseminate clinical / translational data from Cores, Projects, and Molecular Characterization Trials across
the center with the broader mission of fostering cross disciplinary training and collaboration; (3) Develop a
ROBIN center wide workforce development program relying on interdisciplinary training for clinicians,
physicists and radiation biologists in translational radiation biology."

Acute pancreatitis is a common inflammatory disorder with short- and long-term clinical

prospective, longitudinal, observational cohort study in AP, along with a series of hypothesis-
driven investigations in AP-related DM. We propose The Ohio State University Clinical Center
(OSU-CC), an innovative, strategically aligned, multi-disciplinary team of nationally-recognized

Jing Sun is a physician epidemiologist and Assistant Scientist in the Department of Epidemiology at Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She seeks a mentored career development award to fill knowledge
gaps in her current training, allowing her to develop as an independent molecular epidemiologist who can bridge
the diverse fields of HIV epidemiology, genetics / epigenetics, and aging to improve long-term outcomes among
people with HIV (PWH). Since the advent of effective antiretroviral therapy, there has been a rising burden of
aging-related conditions among PWH. Mitochondrial damage is a major driver of aging, but its role in HIV and
aging has been understudied. Leveraging data, infrastructure, and the biospecimens of two long-term HIV
cohorts (ALIVE and MACS), Dr. Sun will define the relationship between mitochondrial DNA copy number, a
noninvasive marker of mitochondrial content, and biological aging at the phenotypic, molecular, and
immunological levels among people with and without HIV (Aim 1). She will further define the interrelationship of
mitochondrial DNA copy number with DNA methylation and nuclear genetics using existing data from ALIVE and
MACS (Aim 2). In Aim 3, she will design a study nested within an ongoing exercise intervention trial to evaluate
the effect of exercise on mitochondrial function, methylation patterns, and physical function among PWH. To
complete these research aims and develop an independent research program, Dr. Sun will receive training in
the following areas: (1) statistical genetics and multi-omics analysis; (2) laboratory measurement of mitochondrial
function; (3) biobanking and management; (4) research leadership. The training program consists of didactic
coursework and seminars, hands-on practice in statistical genetics analysis, informational laboratory visits and
shadowing, participation in a certificate program, and mentored research by an established and diverse team of
senior investigators. Completion of the proposed aims will directly address important epidemiological,
mechanistic, and interventional knowledge gaps and elucidate the role of mitochondrial function on biological
aging among PWH. Findings will provide evidence for targets of future clinical and interventional research with
the potential to guide long-term management and improve quality of life among PWH. Preliminary data and
research capacity built through this K01 award will support an R01 investigating the role of mitochondrial function,
aging, and comorbidities among PWH using a multi-omics approach. It will further support Dr. Sun’s long-term
career goals to become an international leader in HIV and aging with content expertise in mitochondrial genetics
and function."

Much mental health research uses neurophysiological measurements to describe the
way neural activity within and across brain regions is related to behavioral function and
dysfunction. One kind of signal, known as a spike train, comes from an individual
neuron. Another, the local field potential (LFP), is based on activity from large numbers
of neurons within specified parts of the brain. For both kinds of data, scientifically
rigorous statistical analysis must accommodate unstable fluctuations, associated with
movement or thought, known in statistics as non-stationarity. The continuing research
program of this grant is to develop methods for analyzing non-stationary neural data.
The number of neural signals that can be recorded simultaneously has been increasing
rapidly. Because neural network dysfunction is widely considered to be associated with
psychopathology, improvements in recording technologies offer exciting opportunities,
but they also create big statistical challenges due to greatly increased complexity. To
provide the most useful information for designing novel therapies it is important to
characterize the interactions among different parts of the brain, and the timing of these
interactions relative to behavior. The research in this grant aims to develop methods for
analyzing the ways that a network of brain areas may change with particular variables,
including those that help characterize behavior. This involves the transmission of neural
information at multiple timescales: slower timescales can provide insight into states of
the brain, such as the extent to which a subject is paying attention to a task; fast
timescales include oscillations and neural synchrony, which could provide an essential
mechanism of neural network information flow and may be a marker that distinguishes
normal from diseased states. New methods investigated in this research program can
accommodate both faster and slower timescales, and they can also accommodate
relationships arising from the spatial configuration of electrodes that record neural
signals. Because a neural spike train is a set of times at which a neuron fired, it is
common to consider it to be a point process, which is the statistical model set up to
handle sequences of event times. The research supported by this grant concerns
development and investigation of statistical techniques involving both multi-dimensional
continuous time series (for LFPs) and multi-dimensional point processes (for spike
trains)."
10896349,"Project Summary
 New treatments are needed for bipolar disorder (BD). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) shows
promise for BD, but the optimal treatment targets for mania, depression, and mood stabilization are unknown.
Studying brain lesions that cause BD symptoms provides causal insights into neuroanatomy. These causal
insights are critically important for target identification. Lesion network mapping (LNM) leverages the human
connectome to map brain lesions onto brain networks rather than single brain regions, enhancing lesion
localization and target identification. Pioneered by the Fox lab (Mentor), LNM shows promise for optimizing TMS
targets for unipolar depression. Two recent Fox lab studies used LNM to examine the brain circuitry causally
implicated in mania (n=56, two datasets) and depression (n=461, five datasets). However, there are two critical
limitations of this prior work. First, mania and depression were analyzed as independent states rather than
opposing poles of a valence spectrum in BD. This limitation will be addressed with a single model analysis of
mania, depression, and control lesions. Second, these studies did not validate targets in patients with BD. This
limitation will be addressed by validating lesion-derived targets in patients with BD using functional neuroimaging
and behavioral testing. Aim 1 is to derive and validate TMS targets for mood valence. These valence-specific
targets will be derived with LNM contrasts of mania vs. depression (and vice versa) in an a priori prefrontal cortex
mask, and the results will be validated by correlating their whole-brain connectivity to task-based measures of
valence bias in patients with BD. Aim 2 is to derive and validate a TMS target for mood stabilization. This
valence-nonspecific target will be derived with LNM contrasts of mania plus depression vs. controls in an a priori
ventrolateral prefrontal cortex mask, and the resulting target will be validated by correlating its whole-brain
connectivity to a task-based measure of emotion regulation in patients with BD.
 This study aligns with the NIMH 2020 Strategic Plan objective of developing novel tools with which to
characterize brain networks causally implicated in affective processes. A follow-up R01 or R61/33 grant
examining whether TMS alters behavioral metrics, functional connectivity, and clinical outcomes in patients with
BD aligns with NIMH’s experimental therapeutics approach. This grant was designed to provide the stepwise
scientific training necessary to fulfill this plan, from LNM and biostatistics to translational research involving
phenotyping and imaging of patients with BD. It also fits well with the long-term goal of becoming an
independently funded physician-scientist who leads an Interventional Psychiatry research program primarily
focused on deriving, validating, and testing circuit-based TMS targets. With this goal in focus, there is no better
place to train than Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a Harvard Medical School affiliate offering world-class
mentors, a robust TMS service in the Center for Brain Circuit Therapeutics, Harvard Catalyst
Clinical/Translational Science Center, and Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging."
10896350,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men, with
incidence and mortality rates varying across Africans and Europeans. The vast majority of deaths
from PCa occur among the approximately 10-15% of patients diagnosed with aggressive PCa.
The etiology of PCa is poorly understood. Basic research supports a crucial role of certain proteins
in PCa development. Epidemiological studies also have identified multiple candidate protein
biomarkers for PCa. However, conventional epidemiologic studies were conducted primarily in
Europeans, and it is unclear which of the candidate protein biomarkers may be European-specific
or pan-ethnic. Also, findings with many of these biomarkers have been inconsistent, potentially
due to major methodological limitations, such as selection bias and uncontrolled confounding.
Besides understanding etiology, identifying causal protein biomarkers can potentially contribute
to improving risk prediction. For PCa, substantial efforts have been made to identify high-risk
populations for improving PCa screening. However, the performance of available PCa risk
prediction models remains unsatisfactory. There are critical needs to 1) apply a novel study design
with reduced limitations of conventional biomarker studies for characterizing PCa causally related
protein biomarkers across Africans and Europeans to improve the etiology understanding; and 2)
develop improved prediction models that may effectively facilitate PCa risk/aggressiveness
assessment across Africans and Europeans. One strategy to potentially decrease limitations of
unmeasured confounding is to use genetic instruments for assessing the relationship between
proteins and PCa. While our previous studies have utilized proteins measured in blood, it is also
critical to study prostate tissue, the most relevant tissue for PCa development, as levels of many
proteins show tissue-specific effects. The proposed project will apply a series of new studies to
address these important knowledge gaps. Specifically, we will 1) conduct a study to identify
putative causal protein biomarkers for PCa risk and aggressiveness across Africans and
Europeans by applying novel methods (Aim 1); 2) functionally characterize top protein biomarkers
for their roles in PCa biology (Aim 2); and 3) develop and validate ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic
prediction models for PCa risk and aggressiveness, by incorporating newly identified candidate
protein biomarkers and integrating results from multiple statistical methods (Aim 3). Our study will
generate important new knowledge for PCa etiology, and develop improved PCa
risk/aggressiveness prediction models across Africans and Europeans. The proposed new
methods can also be applied to other complex diseases."

10897132,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – RESEARCH COMPONENT 
 The goal of this study entitled, “Sleep and Circadian Dysfunction, Brain and Neurobehavioral Development 
in Autism” is to examine how disturbed sleep and altered circadian rest/activity rhythms (RARs) affect brain 
development, cognitive and adaptive function, and symptom severity in children with autism. Disturbed sleep 
is highly prevalent among children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); over 60% are estimated to exhibit 
frequent sleep disturbances, including delayed sleep onset, fragmented nighttime sleep, and early-morning 
waking. While typically viewed as a consequence of ASD, disturbed sleep may not only have acute effects on 
cognition, adaptive functioning, and behavioral disturbances in this population. Notably, while many studies 
have evaluated the relationship between disordered sleep and neuroimaging, and neuroimaging and ASD, no 
work, to our knowledge, has integrated these topics. Furthermore, rigorous comparison of sleep and RAR 
metrics via parent-report and actigraphy have not been conducted in ASD. 
 For this project, we propose to address these gaps through refining how sleep/wake problems are 
assessed in children with ASD by applying novel statistical modeling to both objective (using actigraphy) and 
parent-report (using CSHQ) measures and examining how disturbed sleep and altered RARs might affect brain 
structure and function in children with ASD. We embed this project in the Kennedy Krieger Institute-Johns 
Hopkins University Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center (IDDRC), leveraging crucial 
resources in phenotypic assessment, neuroimaging, biostatistics, and behavioral preparation for procedures 
that are available through the Center. At the same time, this investigative team brings new statistical and 
epidemiologic expertise to Center Cores, to conduct this study in 200 children with and without ASD. Via this 
project, Center resources will be used to further integrate this population with 493 children with extant data (but 
not wrist actigraphy), establishing a large-well phenotyped population for Center research. This work will help 
to refine and inform clinical and prevention practices among children with disordered sleep and ASD, providing 
methodological advances in sleep characterization and etiology."
10897133,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – GENOMICS CORE 
 The goal of the Genomics Core is to provide IDDRC-supported projects with access to state-of-the-art 
technology and expertise relevant to understanding genetic factors associated with intellectual and 
developmental disabilities (IDD). The Genomics Core accomplishes its mission through four specific aims. In 
Aim 1, the Core provides consultation services for genomics research. These services include facilitating 
protocol development for IRB-approved human subject research, offering guidance to researchers and 
clinicians about study design and appropriate utilization of next-generation sequencing technologies and 
specialized genomics applications, and offering assistance in grant applications that involve genomics projects. 
The second Aim is to provide genomics services in the general areas of next-generation sequencing, 
genotyping, cytogenetics and chromosomal microarray analysis. This includes specialized genomic services 
ranging from whole exome and whole genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and ChIP-seq to single molecule 
sequencing. The Core offers a full-service CAP certified biorepository. For Aim 3 the Genomics Core assists 
with data analysis, offering guidance on the use of compute resources to store and analyze data including the 
interpretation of genomics data. Aim 4 is to provide educational activities and dissemination opportunities, 
including a variety of workshops and classes. These Specific Aims are integrated with each other and with 
other Cores of the IDDRC. The Genomics Core places a heavy emphasis on the etiology, natural history and 
prognosis of a variety of conditions associated with developmental delay and specific features of 
developmental disabilities. This emphasis helps IDDRC researchers to elucidate the phenotypic variations 
which are associated with genetic mutations (e.g., chromosomal anomalies, genomic copy number changes, 
single nucleotide variation and short insertions and deletions [indels])."

 The Behavioral Phenotyping Core (BPC) supports development, implementation, and dissemination of a 
broad spectrum of scientific inquiries focused on understanding mechanisms affecting brain development, 
behavior, and cognition among individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Unique Core 
attributes include: (1) access to data about a wide range of genetic and neurodevelopmental disorders, via a 
registry and research database of over 27,000 individuals with deep neurocognitive/behavioral phenotyping; 
(2) significant expertise in assessment and intervention with very low functioning individuals, including those 
with sensory, motor, and/or communication impairments, and individuals with the most severe and challenging 
behaviors; (3) ability to implement remote assessments through wearable and video-based assessment 
technology; (4) a catalog of over 500 validated quantitative neuropsychological and behavioral assessment 
instruments, ready to implement in clinical trials via highly- trained examiners; (5) a state-of-the-art motion 
analysis unit equipped with movement imaging, robotics, force analysis, sensation and proprioception 
measurement capabilities; and (6) clinical and research neurophysiology resources, including a full range

researchers to investigate the full range of biomarkers (neuroimaging, physiologic, “-omic”) in IDD, and to link 
these directly to deep behavioral phenotyping in humans. 
 Specific aims are accomplished primarily through the integration of Core faculty expertise with resources, 
facilities, equipment, and direct services from four complementary units within the Core, including behavior 
analysis, motion analysis, developmental neuropsychology and clinical neurophysiology. With these rich and 
diverse resources, development and validation of a wide range of outcome measures for clinical trial readiness 
in IDD, is a fundamental component of the Core, along with dissemination or resources and scientific 
discoveries."

10897143,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The University of Chicago and Rush University Medical Center both have well-developed infrastructures for
health disparities research that support a number of established investigators with diverse areas of expertise.
Both institutions also have longstanding partnerships with a multitude of key community organizations in their
respective geographic locations on Chicago’s West and South sides. The Investigator Development Core for the
Chicago Chronic Condition Equity Network (C3EN) seeks to leverage these strengths to expand and cultivate
the regional network of health disparities researchers in the greater Chicago region. The Core has three aims.
Aim 1 is to manage a Research Project Pilot Grant program that funds compelling pilot studies from a diverse
group of early stage health disparities researchers. Funding priority will go to proposals for pilot studies that
inform novel interventions to reduce chronic disease disparities, that include intersectoral work that features
collaborations with community partners in non-health sectors, and that come from investigators with
underrepresented backgrounds. Aim 2 is to award “mini-grants” to support important, time-limited activities that
strengthen an academic-community collaboration prior to and following the conduct of a research study. These
activities help identify priorities for collaboration, inform the design of a research project, and help to demonstrate
the researcher’s commitment to the partnership. Aim 3 is to provide early stage grantees with unique resources
and support as they conduct their pilot project, publish their work, and prepare funding proposals that build on
their preliminary data. Both during and after their pilot project, grantees will have access to a formal mentorship
program; ongoing methodological support in biostatistics, data science, and intersectoral action for health; and
regular engagement in research progress meetings and seminar series. We will track and adapt our approach
based on meaningful performance metrics that capture our Core’s ability to inspire and support innovative pilot
projects that catalyze the careers of the next generation of health disparities researchers in the greater Chicago
region."
10897148,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Persons with Multiple Chronic Conditions (MCCs) experience increased risk of disability, reduced quality of life,
increased hospitalizations, and death. The burden of MCCs falls particularly hard on African Americans (AAs)
who have a higher prevalence of multimorbidity than non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics, and have earlier
declines in physical functioning and higher prevalence of disability. In our work in Chicago’s west side AA
community, we have observed these adverse impacts of MCCs on physical functioning. For over a decade, Rush
researchers and AA churches have collaborated through the Alive Faith Network (AFN) to work for health equity
in the Chicago region. Recent health screenings with congregants and the community demonstrated high rates
of lower extremity physical function limitations, with physical function limitations most common among those with
chronic illness. Since physical activity (PA) offers an effective approach to reducing morbidity and mortality
among persons experiencing MCC-associated impairments, Church partners have called for the testing of PA
interventions that might address this health challenge. Investigators will therefore test a multi-level PA program
that community members named Keep It Movin’ (KIM). The KIM intervention builds on the evidence-based
Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study which showed that a structured PA program
can reduce mobility disability among older adults with limitations of physical function. Findings from the LIFE
intervention have not been previously tested in predominantly AA communities. Participants in the KIM pilot
study reported significant barriers to engaging in recommended PA, including symptoms such as pain and
dyspnea, fear of injury, and functional limitations. We have therefore adapted the LIFE intervention for
implementation, adding functional education to help overcome barriers to starting and maintaining regular PA
among persons with MCCs. We hypothesize that this augmented intervention, which enhances capability of
church members through additional social support and education by knowledgeable rehabilitation specialists,
will lead to both increased physical function and increased PA among AA adults with PF limitations due to MCCs.
The study will determine if, relative to matched participants from comparator churches, participants receiving the
Keep it Movin’ intervention will have improved physical function at 6 months, as documented by mean SPPB
scores at least 0.50 points higher. Secondary aims include testing the KIM intervention relative to an education
comparator condition at 6 and 12 months on outcomes of Moderate or Vigorous PA, social support for PA, self-
efficacy for PA, quality of life and self-reported physical functioning. We will use the RE-AIM framework to assess
reach and factors driving successful adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the Keep it Moving
intervention across churches."
10897151,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the 30 million adults with DM in the United States, 97% have at least one comorbid condition (e.g.
hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease). DM and DM-related complications disproportionately affect people
of color. The prevalence of DM is higher among Hispanics (12.5%) and African-Americans (11.7%) compared to
non-Hispanic whites (7.5%); Hispanics and African-Americans have higher rates of diabetes-related
complications, including amputations and CKD. Group visits (GVs) can provide patients with comprehensive
care for their multimorbid chronic condition. Diabetes GVs—shared appointments where patients receive self-
management education in a group setting and an individual medical visit—can improve glycemic control,
decrease healthcare utilization, and provide social support and co-learning among peers. While virtual
appointments have become a routine part of clinical care during the COVID-19 pandemic, group visits via virtual
platforms remain uncommon and understudied. Before the model can be widely adopted, important questions
about the effectiveness and implementation of the virtual diabetes GV model need to be addressed. We propose
to build on an established program of in-person diabetes GVs and a virtual diabetes GV pilot by the University
of Chicago and MidWest Clinician’s Network. We aim to implement the virtual GV model (VIDA: Virtual Diabetes
Group Visits Across Health Systems) in two distinct health systems in the Chicago region: ACCESS and
Advocate Aurora Health (AAH). ACCESS is one of the largest federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) in the
U.S. with 35 sites across the Chicago metropolitan area, providing care for 175,000 medically underserved and
low-income patients each year, including over 25,000 patients with diabetes. Advocate Aurora Health (AAH) is
a large, diverse, integrated private not-for profit health system with more than 129 primary care clinics in Illinois
serving over 117,000 patients with diabetes. The ability to train, implement and evaluate virtual group visits
across two distinct health systems provides a unique opportunity to learn about adaptation and the barriers and
facilitators for program implementation. This study will use a type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation design
via a pragmatic cluster randomized trial to assess changes in clinical outcomes among adults with T2DM in
virtual diabetes GVs versus usual care. We will first adapt and implement VIDA at one ACCESS FQHC center
and one AAH primary care clinic using the Form and Function domains of the Complex Health Intervention
Framework. We will assess integration of VIDA into clinical workflow and determine the type of and amount of
training and technical support needed to assist staff in integrating virtual diabetes GV into the clinical setting. We
will then conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial of virtual GVs across 9 intervention sites (180 adult patients
with T2DM with A1C >9%) and 9 control sites (360 matched patients) and assess change in A1C from baseline
to 12-months and change in other clinical outcomes including systolic blood pressure and body mass index. We
will assess adoption, implementation, and maintenance of virtual GVs across systems using RE-AIM framework."
10897153,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Physical activity is essential for all age groups, across all comorbidities and geriatric syndromes; it has been
described as the ‘ideal’ intervention for preserving functional independence during aging. Physical activity
interventions have repeatedly been shown to improve frailty and physical performance, and to prevent mobility
disability and death among high-risk older adults. Multimorbid, homebound, older adults face substantial
physiologic and functional challenges and structural barriers to maintaining physical activity over time.
Multimorbidity is more severe and more prevalent among African-Americans over their lifespan, and they
experience more accelerated aging than any other race in the US. Disrupted physiology, the need for assistance
to leave home, reliance on care partners who have limited training or tools to provide support, and lack of
coverage for long-term exercise services in the home prohibit exercise participation in this vulnerable group most
likely to experience functional gains from interventions. Increasing physical activity among multimorbid,
homebound older adults requires a shift in interventions to target the older adult-care partner dyads and to test
innovative vehicles for remote intervention delivery. We developed a socially-motivated exercise tool targeting
multimorbid, African-American, homebound older adults and their care partners called EngAGE that leverages
voice-activated technology. EngAGE was co-designed with targeted users through iterative participatory design
methodology. Following a successful feasibility study providing preliminary evidence of effectiveness, we now
propose a randomized, in-home, efficacy trial of EngAGE (intervention) versus paper exercise handouts (usual
care) in n=124 multimorbid, African-American, homebound older adult-care partner dyads. Over 7 million U.S.
older adults cannot easily reach health services outside of the home and >34.2 million informal U.S. caregivers
support their care without guidance. Results from this proposal will demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel,
scalable program promoting exercise among this difficult-to-reach group of older adults while supporting the care
partners with critical tools."

10897297,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 2
The focus of Project 2 of this Program Project is to achieve a fully permissive replication system and detailed
molecular understanding of host and viral functions that control human norovirus (HuNoV) replication. For
almost 50 years, the most significant barrier to HuNoV research was the lack of an efficient in vitro cell
cultivation system. We recently succeeded in establishing a robust and reproducible cultivation system for
many HuNoV strains in human stem cell-derived intestinal enteroids (HIEs) that overcomes the longstanding
hurdle to cultivation. Strain-specific differences in replication were discovered and the system is being used to
study virus neutralization, antiviral activity and HuNoV biology. The goal of Project 2 is to continue to
understand and overcome newly recognized remaining barriers in the cultivation of all HuNoVs in HIEs. We
will address this goal through two aims that outline studies to (i) continue to improve and simplify the
cultivation system by understanding virus entry into cells and (ii) identify the cellular receptor(s) for HuNoVs
(Aim 1), and (iii) understand the molecular mechanisms by which norovirus replication induces and regulates
cellular innate responses and how these cellular responses restrict viral replication and spread (Aim 2).
Therapeutics and host molecules associated with disease and virus clearance (Project 1), and structural
insight into viral-host interactions (Project 3) will be tested for their effects on HuNoV replication. Overall,
these studies are designed to lead to a fully permissive, simple and affordable replication system, gain new
molecular understanding of host and viral functions that control virus replication and provide new insight about
HuNoV biology. The program project brings together a highly collaborative group of investigators with diverse
skills and talents, and substantial record of working together. As in the previous funding period, the
interactions among each project and each of the cores will be extensive such that the activities of each project
will be enhanced considerably over what could be accomplished if the projects were pursued independently."

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne RNA virus, causes chikungunya fever (CHIKF), typically
accompanied by severe, debilitating and often chronic arthralgia. The virus was first associated with human
disease in the 1950s in Tanzania, and has re-emerged, causing epidemics in Africa, Asia, Europe, and
Americas over the last decade. Neither antiviral treatment nor vaccines are available for CHIKV infection.
Animal models have been used to understand CHIKV infection and virus-induced acute and persistent
arthralgia. CHIKV infection induces viremia, acute and chronic arthralgia in immunocompetent mice and severe
lethal diseases in mice deficient of interferon (IFN)-I signaling. The limitation of murine models of CHIKV
infection is that they do not recapitulate human CHIKV diseases completely, in particular CHIKV-induced
chronic arthralgia and maternal/neonatal transmission. Thus, development of other feasible small animal
models to recapitulate CHIKV-induced human diseases is in high need. The golden Syrian hamster has been
used in studying many human viral infections. CHIKV infection in wild-type hamsters induced viremia, rapid
virus dissemination to major organs, and histopathologic lesions in limbs and joints as reported in human
patients. Nevertheless, infectious virus was cleared within 4 days. Investigation of viral RNA persistence and
chronic tissue injury in wild-type and optimized mutant hamsters will be critical for further development of a
hamster model of CHIKV infection. Type I and III IFNs contribute to the control of CHIKV infection in mice and
cell culture models. Both signaling pathways result in activation of signal transducer and activator of
transcription 2 (STAT2). By utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system to conduct gene targeting in hamsters, we
previously produced STAT2 knockout (KO) hamsters. STAT2 KO hamsters have been used in several other
viral disease models to increase viral replication and severity of viral diseases and to recapitulate Zika virus
vertical transmission in humans. SARS-CoV-2 replication was also enhanced in hamsters defective of IL28Rα,
a subunit of type III IFN receptor compared to wild-type hamsters. Furthermore, adaptive immunity has been
shown to play critical roles in controlling CHIKV infection in mice and humans. To further define the hamster as
a model for CHIKV infection, we hypothesize that type I and/or III IFNs contribute to control of CHIKV
infection, virus-induced tissue inflammation and vertical transmission, and protect host from CHIKV-
induced chronic disease via modulating adaptive immune responses in hamsters. We will first determine
viral infection, tissue inflammation, and vertical transmission following CHIKV infection in STAT2 KO and
IL28Rα KO hamsters. We will also identify the role of humoral and T cell- mediated immune responses in
CHIKV-induced chronic diseases in hamsters. Results from this study will not only refine a novel hamster
model of CHIKV-induced chronic arthralgia, but also increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of CHIKV
infection and vertical transmission."

I am a clinical researcher and Director of the Neurodevelopmental Laboratory on Addictions and Mental Health
at McLean Hospital. I also am an Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. I have been
continuously funded as a principal investigator (PI) to conduct NIAAA-sponsored patient-oriented research
(POR) since 2004 and have been a collaborator and consultant on multiple NIH-sponsored grants. My
research focusing on understanding adolescent brain development, and risk for and underlying neurobiology of
addiction and psychiatric disorders. During the first 5-year K24 period, I provided mentoring to 50 individuals
ranging in rank from undergraduates through psychiatry residents and junior faculty. These mentees have
made notable success, including publishing papers, submitting grant applications and being promoted. I work
in a rich environment for clinical research, which is ideal for providing mentoring in POR. As I receive no
institutional support for mentoring and will be required to curtail mentoring efforts to assume significant non-
research responsibilities, a K24 renewal will continue to provide protected time that would allow me to maintain
and increase my intensive mentorship to trainees, and attract new research mentees to POR. My immediate
and long-term career objectives are to continue characterizing neurobiological markers in addiction and
psychiatric disorders, which will inform the development of new and effective treatments for alcohol use
disorders and for individuals with dual diagnoses, and to train the next generation of investigators to develop
the skills they require to effectively conduct POR. I remain committed to disseminating research findings
(through publications, scientific lectures and public outreach) and provide mentoring to trainees in public
outreach, the goal of which is to provide education around alcohol research, which in turn will help prevention
efforts and inform treatment interventions, to aid in the reduction of suffering due to alcohol use and abuse.
The specific aims to be accomplished during the period of the award are to 1) provide substantive mentoring of
junior investigators and trainees in POR (35%), with a focus on mentoring underrepresented minority trainees;
2) continue and extend involvement in my POR (10%), and 3) advance my expertise in the content areas of
adolescent comorbid psychopathology, clinical approaches in adolescent treatment, and conducting research
in vulnerable adolescent and adult populations, including racial/ethnically disadvantaged youth and those
navigating gender identity development, both with established evidence of mental health disparities (5%).
Despite the challenges imposed by the COVID19 pandemic, these mentoring relationships have continued to
grow, and trainees are making significant strides in their paths toward POR. I remain deeply committed to the
continued training of a remarkable group of mentees, who are the future of addiction and psychiatry POR.
Through intensive mentoring I will enhance my POR by increasing my clinical perspectives, and by
incorporating treatment and multicultural considerations into my POR initiatives."

Chronic ethanol exposure is associated with gut dysbiosis, impaired immunity, and the development of organ
dysfunction leading to a rising appreciation for inter-organ crosstalk for ethanol-induced pathologies. First hit by
ethanol ingestion, the intestine and gut microbiome play a central role in immune system homeostasis. Chronic
ethanol decreases gut bacterial abundance and diversity and destabilizes the intestinal epithelial barrier, which
is associated with reduced luminal butyrate and intestinal all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) levels, systemic endotoxin,
and inflammation. Intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (EC), located within the intestinal lamina propria, are
critical for mucosal immune function by recruiting and activating leukocytes and regulating gut vascular perfusion.
Following ethanol-induced epithelial barrier disruption and endotoxin translocation, proinflammatory molecules
interact with intestinal microvascular EC and immune cells within the lamina propria. Endothelial and immune
cell activation by bacterial endotoxins leads to their dysfunction. The intestinal microvascular endothelial barrier
serves as second defensive barrier for a disrupted epithelium, providing additional protection against
macromolecule and microbe translocation. Butyrate and atRA are intestinal-generated immune nutrients known
to promote epithelial barrier function, and immune homeostasis via T-lymphocyte regulation. We have shown
butyrate (tributyrin) supplementation mitigates ethanol-induced gut-liver injury by preventing disassembly of
epithelial tight junction proteins, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting expression of intestinal microvascular
endothelial associated junctional proteins and immune cells in mouse proximal colon. Here we propose the
hypothesis that through ethanol’s disruption of the gut microbiome, depletion of butyrate and all-trans retinoic
acid, and subsequent destabilization of the intestinal epithelial barrier and translocation of endotoxin, intestinal
microvascular endothelium become functionally disrupted and activated which induces intestinal T-cell
dysregulation and inflammation. We will test two specific aims. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that ethanol-induced
gut dysbiosis, resultant butyrate depletion and epithelial barrier destabilization disrupts intestinal microvascular
endothelial junctional protein integrity. Using both in vivo and ex vivo approaches, we will study how butyrate
mitigates the effects of ethanol on endothelium disassembly of barrier junctional proteins. Aim 2: Test the
hypothesis that ethanol activates and induces alterations in T-cell homing and Treg expansion within the
intestinal lamina propria which causes intestinal microvascular endothelial dysregulation in a butyrate and atRA
dependent manner. We will utilize ex vivo co-culture system, and in vivo wild-type and Foxp3DTR mice to test for
ethanol-induced activation of intestinal microvascular EC, T-cell homing receptors, and Treg expansion and
cytokine responses in lamina propria and splenocytes. Importantly, intestinal microvascular EC has not been
studied in the context of ethanol, butyrate and atRA, and therefore new mechanistic insights may bring novel
therapeutics to protect against ethanol’s disruption in intestinal homeostasis."

Dr. Boyle proposes a 5-year mentored research training program to become an independent clinician
investigator leading prehospital pediatric emergency care research. She has a strong background in basic
science research and is a board-certified Pediatric Emergency Physician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics
at Boston University. Her current research focuses on testing system-level interventions to improve patient-
oriented outcomes of critically ill and injured children. This proposal focuses on teleconsultation as an
innovative intervention to improve prehospital treatment of children with acute respiratory emergencies and to
facilitate transitions of care to acute care hospitals. Dr. Boyle’s career development plan includes systematic
education and mentoring in intervention optimization; the use of simulation as a research tool for early phase
intervention testing; clinical trial design and analysis; and training in the ethics of prehospital emergency care
research, including emergency exceptions to informed consent and protection of children as human subjects.
She has assembled a multidisciplinary expert team to support her on this project, led by primary mentor,
James Feldman, MD, MPH, FACEP and co-mentor, Carlos Camargo, MD, DrPH, FACEP. Her training plan
includes a combination of formal coursework and workshops, scientific seminars and meetings, and a focused
research ethics internship. These will be paired with mentored research studies where she will test the central
hypothesis that pediatric teleconsultation (intervention) by Emergency Medical Service (EMS) providers will
result in measurably safer care for children with life-threatening respiratory illness as compared to usual care.
Dr. Boyle has partnered with local Massachusetts EMS systems and an affiliated pediatric specialty transport
system to refine and pilot test the intervention in simulated and real pediatric respiratory emergencies. The
specific aims of this career development proposal are to: (1) Identify predictors of stakeholder acceptance of
prehospital teleconsultation for children with a mixed methods study; (2) Estimate intervention acceptability,
feasibility, and effect size for prehospital team resuscitation performance in simulated pediatric respiratory
emergencies using a pilot randomized controlled trial; and (3) Field test acceptability and feasibility of using a
mobile video-conferencing platform for remote assessment of children transported by ambulance for
respiratory distress. This proposal serves the dual purpose of supporting Dr. Boyle’s transition to
independence as a clinician investigator in patient-oriented research, as well as generating important pilot data
to estimate clinical effect, provide sample size justification, and establish the acceptability and feasibility of
using a teleconsultation platform optimized for prehospital providers to guide future definitive trials of efficacy. If
funded, this research will determine whether teleconsultation, a promising intervention to increase access to
high quality care in rural and underserved settings, can improve prehospital emergency care for children."

and Transmission Potential
Project Summary
Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many countries in the tropics and subtropics. Most malaria
programs focus on diagnosis and treatment of clinical infections and blanket vector control through bed net
distributions. This strategy does not adequately target the asymptomatic reservoir, which is the source of up to
95% of malaria transmission. There is a lack of understanding of the ability of many current and new malaria
control tools to shrink the asymptomatic reservoir because many studies evaluating interventions focus on
clinical incidence as the main outcome. Spatial repellents are a novel tool for malaria control. They release
volatile compounds that drive away mosquitos from houses. Spatial repellents might reduce clinical incidence
by up to 50%. Their impact on the prevalence of asymptomatic infections has not been systematically studied.
The ability of spatial repellents to reduce clinical incidence is currently being field-tested in a funded large-scale
cluster randomized trial in western Kenya. Our preliminary data shows that nearly half of all individuals in the
study site carried asymptomatic malaria infections at baseline. Given the importance of these infections as a
source of transmission, there is a need to understand whether spatial repellents can also reduce this reservoir
in order to assess their full potential to combat malaria. Here, we propose to study the impact of spatial repellents
on asymptomatic P. falciparum prevalence. The objectives of this application are to: 1) Quantify reductions
in asymptomatic prevalence after the introduction of spatial repellents. We will screen 9000 blood samples
currently being collected for P. falciparum infections by qPCR and microscopy. 2) Compare mosquito-to-
human and human-to-mosquito transmission in intervention and control clusters. We will quantify
gametocytes and compare parasite and gametocyte prevalence and density to vector density, sporozoite rate,
and entomological inoculation rate (EIR) at different time points before and after blood sample collections. The
outcomes of the proposed research include: 1) Knowledge of the potential of spatial repellents to reduce
asymptomatic prevalence, and 2) an understanding of the changes in mosquito-to-human and human-
to-mosquito transmission after introduction of spatial repellents. Our data on the relationships between
parasitological and entomological measures of transmission intensity, collected in 20 clusters at three timepoints,
will enable a better understanding on the impact of malaria control beyond the use of spatial repellents. Our work
aims to accelerate malaria elimination, and thus to improve the lives of people living in malaria-endemic
countries."

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), has been a major challenge for public health since the first case was reported in December
2019. In May 2023, the WHO and CDC marked the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency. However,
COVID-19 remains a threat due to continuously evolving new variants, and fully vaccinated people remain
susceptible to infection by the newer variants of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 entry is primarily mediated by binding
of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (receptor-binding domain, RBD) to the human angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Although ACE2-expressing cells support robust SARS-CoV-2 viral replication,
ACE2 expression profiles are not completely associated with clinical manifestations or immune responses.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infects organs or cells that do not express ACE2, suggesting the involvement of
alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Our and other laboratories have identified ACE2-independent
alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2, and infection via alternative receptors (e.g. CD147) is resistant to
monoclonal antibodies against spike RBD, which is the target for several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to block ACE2
binding. Our preliminary data show that oral epithelial, salivary gland, and gingival epithelial cells are
susceptible to the replication-competent SARS-CoV-2 and pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant
despite low or undetectable expression of ACE2. These oral epithelial cells do however express high levels of
alternative receptors CD147 or AXL, suggesting the role of alternative receptors in SARS-CoV-2 infection of
oral epithelial cells. We hypothesize that these alternative receptors play a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 infection
and virus-mediated immune activation in region-specific oral epithelial cells. In Aim 1, we will determine
repertories of receptors for SARS-CoV-2 and infection profiles in region-specific oral epithelial cells and tissues
from healthy subjects and subjects with oral inflammation pre- and post-treatment. In Aim 2, we will determine
the contribution of specific receptors to SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus-mediated immune activation in oral
epithelial cells. Considering that the virus will continue to infect humans regularly, it is critical to understand the
role of alternative receptors for SARS-CoV-2 in the oral mucosa, the potential portal of SARS-CoV-2 entry, to
develop anti-viral therapeutics and strategies to dampen virus-mediated immune activation and disease
outcomes, especially as regards emerging variants."

Climate change is a global public health emergency that will increase cardiovascular (CV) and
respiratory/pulmonary (R/P) morbidity and mortality as the population is exposed to more frequent extreme
temperature events and high levels of air pollution from wildfires. The synergistic effects of heat in the
presence of elevated air pollution increases mortality. CV and R/P morbidity and mortality are also health
consequences of certain breast cancer therapies that cause the heart and lungs to function at lower than
optimal levels. This therapy-related tissue damage may increase survivors' susceptibility to CV and R/P
disease from extreme temperature and air pollution. In this grant, we will identify breast cancer survivors'
unique health risks from climate change, by elucidating: · Exposure mechanisms/timeframes of interest,
including whether pre-diagnosis exposure climate-related conditions (temperature, wildfire smoke, air pollution)
during cancer therapy and post-diagnosis acute exposure to these conditions predispose breast cancer
survivors to greater CV and R/P toxicity; · How survivors' risks compare to individuals without cancer; and ·
Which breast cancer survivors face the greatest health risks from climate change, such as Hispanic women or
those with low socioeconomic status. To answer these questions, we will utilize a statewide Utah cohort of
21,835 female breast cancer survivors developed using the Utah Population Database, an epidemiologic data
resource that contains lifetime medical data and longitudinal residential histories. This resource enables us to
measure exposure to temperature and air pollution both prior to diagnosis and in the years following. We will
also utilize a cancer-free, age-matched female population sample (N=65,503). We aim to: 1) Determine if pre-
diagnosis, long-term exposure to extreme temperature and air pollution are associated with CV and R/P health
outcomes occurring while BC survivors are on therapy, limited to <5 years from diagnosis. 2) Estimate the
association of CV and R/P health outcomes and post-diagnosis, short-term exposure to extreme temperature
and air pollution from diagnosis onwards. 3) Identify differences in the effect of pre-diagnosis, long-term
exposure to extreme temperature and air pollution on the CV and R/P health outcomes between breast cancer
survivors and a cancer-free cohort. By identifying extreme temperature conditions and air pollution levels that
are specifically harmful to breast cancer survivors and whether high-risk survivor subgroups face greater risk,
this will allow the development of supportive care efforts to manage cancer-related health effects that are
exacerbated due to climate change."

The gut-brain axis has been recognized as a highway sending beneficial and pathogenic signals in the gut in
milliseconds to the brain and the body. This gut-brain connection may explain the overlap in seemingly
different diseases, namely the overlap between autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and gastrointestinal
dysfunctions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Specifically, individuals with ASD are more likely to
have gastrointestinal problems, and the incidence of IBD flare-ups in patients parallels severity of ASD.
Microbes in the gut utilize the gut-brain axis and evidence suggests they are part of the relationship between
ASD and gut inflammation. Importantly, as gut microbes can be orally delivered to the gut, they present a
therapeutic opportunity to mitigate disease while avoiding problems associated with drugs such as proper
delivery to the target location, off-target effects, and improper dosage. For example, the clinically tested and
commercially available microbe Limosilactobacillus reuteri promotes normal social behavior in six mouse ASD
models and reduces gut inflammation in humans and animals with colitis. Proper utilization of L. reuteri for
ASD and gut inflammation has been road-blocked by a critical unmet need: how does L. reuteri act on the gut
and the brain to mitigate these diseases and how can we optimize the usage of L. reuteri as a human therapy?
Efforts to understand L. reuteri’s mode of action in social behavior have pointed to a necessary role for the
hormone oxytocin release in the brain. Oxytocin is a multi-functional hormone promoting normal social
interaction and stress behaviors and acting as an anti-inflammatory hormone. How L. reuteri signals to release
oxytocin from the brain is unknown other than that the vagal nerve is required. We, therefore, hypothesized
that L. reuteri’s effects on the body begin with its interaction with the intestinal epithelium. Our efforts to
understand how L. reuteri might signal from the gut epithelium led us to make an unexpected finding: L. reuteri
increases the expression and secretion of oxytocin from intestinal epithelial cells. Oxytocin had not been
previously recognized as being produced in the gut epithelium.
These observations led us to ask the question, could gut stimulation of oxytocin be a pre-requisite of brain-
stimulated oxytocin and L. reuteri’s beneficial effects on ASD and gut inflammation? To begin to understand
the role of gut-derived oxytocin in mediating the beneficial effects of L. reuteri, the following specific aims are
proposed: Aim 1. Does intestinal epithelial oxytocin promote normal social and stress behaviors? Aim
2. Does intestinal epithelial oxytocin protect against gut inflammation and damage? The success of
these investigations will open therapeutic possibilities for safely and effectively treating social behavior and gut
dysfunction in ASD individuals."

Social deficits occur across a wide array of neuropsychiatric (NPD) and neurodevelopmental (NDD) disorders
and contribute to poor outcomes and sizable public health costs. However, the lack of adequate
characterization of mechanisms underpinning social impairments by the current categorical diagnostic systems
has significantly stifled the development of etiologically based, individually tailored treatments. A fully
dimensional alternative to the categorical frameworks offered by the National Institute of Mental Health’s
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) holds particular promise for a better understanding of mechanisms behind
social deficits. More specifically, the RDoC initiative operationalizes an initial set of basic, biologically meaningful
components that underpin social functioning, and if disrupted, can impede one’s ability to navigate the
complexities of the social world. These processes can therefore be used to better understand social deficits
seen across NPD/NDD and inform personalization of treatments. However, we currently lack dedicated
measures able to comprehensively capture components of social functioning across clinical, at risk and
normative populations which has significantly impeded the translation and adoption of this potentially promising
framework. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to further expand a recently developed RDoC-based
social processes scale: The Stanford Social Dimensions Scale (SSDS). The goal is to refine, factorize, validate
and establish regression-based norms of the updated SSDS (SSDS-2). We will also aim to construct a
preliminary computerized adaptive testing (CAT) version of the SSDS-2 that will enable individually tailored item
selection and administration. These objectives will be achieved by: 1) obtaining feedback on a preliminary item
bank from experts and parents of children from normative and clinical groups in order to evaluate the content
validity, developmental appropriateness and clinical relevance of the items and to guide the item refinement
(Specific Aim 1); 2) utilizing advanced psychometric approaches including exploratory structural equation
modeling and item response theory on a large online recruited clinically diverse and normative sample to
establish the factor structure (Specific Aim 2); 3) confirming factor structure of the SSDS-2, establishing
regression based and standardized change norms and constructing a preliminary CAT version (Specific Aim 3);
and further validating the SSDS-2 through an in-person multi-method assessment protocol encompassing
interview, observational and experimental methodology with a transdiagnostic sample of youth with a range of
social abilities and typically developing youth and their parents. An additional goal is to examine the association
between the SSDS-2 subdomains with the neural networks subserving corresponding social processes in a
transdiagnostic subsample of youth (Specific Aim 4). This project will lay the foundation for future investigations
aimed at: (i) extending the new measure to different age groups (2-5 years and adulthood); (ii) developing a
companion clinician-rated structured interview, and (iii) testing its utility as a clinical outcome measure."

The cerebellum plays a key role in motor coordination and learning. Classic models posit that cerebellar learning
is instructed by teaching signals from climbing fibers (CFs) that act according to the principles of supervised
learning. While such models work well to describe CF activity and learning in some behaviors, they are not
sufficient to explain CF activity in others. By developing an operant, reward-guided cerebellar-dependent task
for the mouse, as well as a modified classical conditioning task, we used calcium imaging of CF input to Purkinje
cell dendrites to demonstrate that CFs can be driven by reward-related task parameters. Our data suggested
the possibility that CFs might engage in reinforcement learning to report predictions about expected rewards
(reward prediction errors) in a similar manner as dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA).
Importantly, however, our data also show significant differences from some predicitons of leading reinforcement
learning models, and many other properties of cerebellar reward-based learning remain unclear. Thus, it
remains largely unknown how the cerebellum operates in reward-based learning. Here will rigoursly test the
hypothesis that CFs instruct cerbellar learning according to reinforcement learning rules: In the first aim, we will
test whether CF activity obeys the many diverse requirements of reward prediction error signals, for example by
scaling with both the probability and size of an expected reward. To do so, we will use two-photon calcium
imaging to monitor CF input to Purkinje cell dendrites while manipulating reward contingencies during a classical
conditioning paradigm. We will also determine the contribution of behavioral context, learning, and motor output
to CF activity. In the second aim, we will test whether reward-predictive CF activity is generated by reward-
responsive CF activity. This is a key property of reinforcement learning because it binds activity driven by an
unconditioned simulus (US) to activity driven by a conditioned stimulus (CS). We will use classical blocking
experiments and optogenetic manipulations to determine the neccessity and sufficiency of US-linked CF
responses to generating CS-linked CF responses. Finally, in the third aim, we will determine whether CS-linked
CF activity drives learned changes in behavior and cerebellar output. Thus, we will use a combination of
optogenetics and extracellular electrophysioloigcal recordings test the function of reward-related CF activity.
Together, these experiments will reveal the key principles that govern reward-based cerebellar learning, and
how this learning alters cerebellar output and behavior."

 The biracial population is the second-fastest growing demographic group in the US. Biracial adolescents
also have higher risks of substance use as well as violent behavior, school problems, and poor physical and
mental health than many of their monoracial peers. However, little is known about substance use prevention
and interventions in this population. Historically, biracial youth have been either ignored in research or their
many subgroups have been combined into a single “multiracial” category, potentially obscuring clinically
relevant patterns. Moreover, no accepted model explains the factors that increase or decrease the risk of
substance use among biracial youth. Discoveries made during the course of the proposed research will help
accelerate the refinement of existing prevention and intervention programs for biracial adolescents and
emerging adults, and will speed translation of its findings into public health practice.
 We propose to study the 4 subgroups of biracial youth that our prior research has shown to have the
highest risk of substance use, namely biracial White-American Indian, White-Asian, White-Black, and White-
Hispanic youth. In doing so, we will also test a newly developed model, the Double Jeopardy Hypothesis, that
we propose to explain biracial substance use patterns. According to this model, biracial individuals experience
not only the common risk factors for substance use, which are also experienced by monoracial youth but also a
second set of risks unique to being biracial in America.
 This study takes advantage of existing data from two large, longitudinal and nationally representative
databases that include adequate numbers of biracial persons to allow the sample to be divisible into subgroups,
as well as multiple measures of social determinants of health (e.g., perceived discrimination, racial
socialization), substance use, and other behavioral and physical outcomes. The first, Monitoring the Future,
followed students from middle-/high-school through age 55 years. The second, the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent and Adult Health, followed students from age 11 to 42 years.
 After integrating the two datasets using integrative data analysis to study adolescents and emerging
adults ages 13-25 years old (Aim 1), we will determine the onset, prevalence, and developmental trajectories of
substance use (i.e., cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and polydrug use) from adolescence to emerging adulthood
(ages 13-25) (Aim 2). Last, we will explore the relationships of common and unique risk and protective factors
(in the individual, family, peer, school, and community domains) for substance use among biracial adolescents
and emerging adults, examining evidence for the proposed Double Jeopardy Hypothesis (Aim 3).
 Findings will inform more effective and inclusive prevention approaches for an understudied but rapidly
growing sector. If accurate, the Double Jeopardy Hypothesis will provide insight into the lived experience of
biracial adolescents and emerging adults, forming a framework for future research on a range of outcomes."
10891375,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The cerebellum integrates sensory, motor, and internal information to rapidly guide and fine-tune action. This
process has been investigated most extensively for movement control, but the cerebellum is also involved in
the updating of internal states such as reward and working memory. Previous work from this laboratory shows
that the cerebellar region crus I is required for evidence accumulation and decision-making. These findings,
along with preliminary data, led to the hypothesis that cerebellar processing of sensory and internal information
evolves over the course of learning to exert moment-to-moment predictive influence and shape flexible
behavior. The proposed experiments will determine, with quantitative rigor, how cognitive regions of the
cerebellum contribute to neural coding, predictive learning, and forebrain target activity. Past studies of
cerebellar contributions to cognition have been hampered by the coarseness with which neuronal activity could
be monitored and perturbed, pathways traced, and behavior measured. This proposal will overcome these
limitations by using advanced tools, including two-photon calcium imaging, whole-brain transsynaptic viral
tracing, high-density silicon probe recording, and optogenetic perturbation. Aim 1 will determine how predictive
information in cerebellar activity influences working memory. In an evidence-accumulation decision task that
distinguishes neural activity related to evidence accumulation, information retention, and decisions, preliminary
data show that optogenetic inactivation of crus I removes the dependence of decisions on previous evidence,
indicating a necessary role in evidence integration. This aim will examine the main cerebellar pathway with
optogenetics, two-photon imaging, and many-electrode recording to probe learned cerebellar contributions to
sensory processing, working memory, decisions, and motor output with subsecond time resolution. Aim 2 will
characterize learning and transfer of working memory-related neural dynamics. This aim will examine how task
representations evolve during learning in Purkinje cells and deep-nuclear neurons to test the idea that intrinsic
cerebellar signals involved in movement preparation provide a foundation for learning neural responses that
accumulate sensory evidence over time. Aim 3 will evaluate how cerebellar areas involved in cognition shape
activity in connected forebrain areas. This aim will use transsynaptic viral tracing to identify pathways from crus
I through midbrain and thalamus to their targets in the neocortex, and then specifically perturb and monitor
these pathways to identify their contribution to task performance. The long-term goal of this project is to build a
quantitative explanatory framework for cerebellar function in complex behavior. The results are expected to
inform computational models that predict and explain the impact of detailed cerebellum-forebrain interactions.
Together, these studies will significantly advance basic neuroscience of the cerebellum and contribute to
understanding of syndromes marked by cerebellar dysfunction, including attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
and autism spectrum disorder."

Health System (CCHS), Jefferson Health (JH), Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN), and PennState Health

intervention on SDM and LCS in primary care practice. Using a mixed methods 2x2 factorial design, we initially
will recruit and randomize 28 primary care practices and providers either to a Provider Support Group (N=14)
or a Control Group (N=14). Over three years, we will also identify approximately 4,480 patients who are
potentially eligible for LCS and have a scheduled primary care visit. On a weekly basis, we will allocate
identified patients to cohorts and initiate telephone contact with each cohort to verify screening eligibility, obtain
consent, and complete a baseline survey. We will randomize at least 672 patient participants either to a
Patient Outreach Group (N=336) or a Control Group (N=336). Thus, the trial will involve a Provider
Support + Patient Outreach Group, a Provider Support Group, a Patient Outreach Group, and a Control

follows: Aim 1. Assess intervention impact on Lung Cancer Screening (LCS); Aim 2. Assess intervention
impact on Shared Decision Making (SDM); Aim 3. Identify mediators and moderators of screening; and, Aim
4. Assess intervention implementation. We will use health system EMR data, study administrative data,
provider baseline and endpoint survey data, and patient baseline and endpoint survey data, focus group data,
and health system leader interview data to identify practice-, provider- and patient-level factors that impact
intervention effects on screening. In terms of overall impact, this trial will identify effective strategies for
increasing SDM and LCS rates in primary care and for implementing effective strategies in health systems. We
will disseminate study findings through communication channels in participating health systems and more
broadly by reporting results on ClinicalTrials.gov, at health care professional organization meetings, through
local, state and regional conferences, and via publications in peer-reviewed journals."

This proposal is for the career development of Tanyalak Parimon, M.D., into an independent physician-scientist
focused on basic/translational research in lung fibrosis. The PI will have as co-mentors Peter Chen, M.D., who
has an established research program in the lung biology of syndecan-1 and Dolores Di Vizio, M.D., Ph.D., who
is a leading expert in extracellular vesicle biology. The comprehensive training program will include laboratory-
based research, didactic lectures, coursework and workshop, grantsmanship, scientific conferences (internal
and external), and career guidance by a scientific advisory committee that includes the co-mentors. With this
proposal, I will have the opportunity to continue to learn and broaden my research skills and knowledge of
mechanisms of lung injury and repair with a focus in lung fibrosis and extracellular vesicle (EVs) biology.
Additionally, I will leverage the scientific and technical knowledge of leading respiratory research and EVs
experts at Cedars-Sinai and the greater Los Angeles area in performing my research and in my training to
become an independent physician-scientist. For the research proposal, I will be furthering our understanding into
mechanisms of lung fibrosis pathogenesis with the long-term goal to identify the cellular target(s) for a novel
therapeutic option for lung fibrosis and to become a leading independent investigator in this field. Syndecan-1,
a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan primarily expressed on epithelial cells, has extensive roles in
epithelial cells injury and repair, and I show that it has a central role in lung fibroproliferative diseases. The
mechanism that I will explore and is supported by my preliminary data is that syndecan-1 altered the miRNA
profile within extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the alveolar epithelial type II cells (AECII) to promote
fibrogenic changes within the lung microenvironment. These findings led to the hypothesis that syndecan-1
promotes lung fibrosis by controlling anti-fibrotic miRNAs packaging in EVs, thereby reshaping the lung
microenvironment to promote fibroproliferation. Under this career development award, I propose to test the
hypothesis with three specific aims: 1) Identify mechanisms by which syndecan-1 regulates miRNA packaging
into EVs; 2) Elucidate how syndecan-1 facilitates fibrosis by promoting AECII senescence; and 3) Evaluate how
syndecan-1 controls fibrotic epithelial-derived EVs to augment fibroproliferation."

We wish to understand how immunotherapy-induced neurotoxicity occurs. Neurotoxicity is the most pernicious
side effect of several immunotherapies for B-cell leukemias and lymphomas, including CAR T-cell therapy. In
the latter approach, a sample of the patient’s own T-cells are removed, genetically engineered to recognize B-
cell tumors, expanded to large numbers, and then reinfused into the patient. The genetically engineered tumor-
recognition component is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs reprogram T-cells to recognize and kill
tumor cells, regardless of the T-cell’s innate specificity. CAR T-cells specific for the B-cell-associated antigen
CD19 can induce durable complete remissions in patients with otherwise terminal B-cell malignancies. Like
any therapy, though, it has side-effects. CD19-specific CAR T-cells frequently cause a spectrum of
neurological adverse effects (NAE) ranging from disorientation to death. They cannot be prevented or treated
adequately because their pathophysiology is poorly understood. To that end, we developed a novel, immune-
competent humanized mouse model that replicates the anti-tumor efficacy and toxicities (including NAE)
caused clinically by CD19-specific CAR T-cells. In our model, mouse B-cells express a human CD19
transgene (hCD19Tg). Transfer of mouse T-cells – called CART19 cells - that express a hCD19-specific CAR
into hCD19Tg mice cause NAEs that are very similar to those experienced clinically. Because our findings
mirror clinical reports, we suggest the causes of CART19-induced murine NAE will extrapolate to patients
treated with CD19-specific CAR T-cells. Our central hypothesis is that blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption
following CART19 infusion permits leukocytes, fluids, and systemic cytokines to enter the central nervous
system (CNS). Here these systemic cytokines, and to a greater extent cytokines produced in the CNS by
CART19 cells, activate resident microglial cells and extravasated myeloid cells. The differentiation of both into
proinflammatory cells ultimately causes NAE. We propose two aims to test these hypotheses. The first aim will
reveal what causes BBB dysfunction while the second aim will determine what drives NAE. We will learn how
CART19 cells cross the BBB and if their persistent activation in the CNS contributes to or drives NAE. Using
genetic, immunological, and pharmacological methods, we also will assess the contributions of resident and
extravasated peripheral myeloid cells and specific cytokines to NAE. Finally, we will assess how NAE affects
gene and protein expression by brain parenchymal cells using single cell approaches. Our proposed project
will significantly impact two areas: 1) basic research in CNS pathobiology as it relates to NAE and 2)
translational research as it relates to improving CD19-specific CAR T-cell therapy for human B-cell
malignancies."

Despite advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities, the 5-year survival of patients with pancreatic
adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains woefully low. Unfortunately, African Americans (AA) bear a disproportionate
brunt of this disease and both the incidence and mortality of PDAC are higher amongst them. Better
understanding of the causes of these disparities will help develop novel strategies to address them.
Pancreatic cancer is a mutation-driven cancer. Alterations in tumor driver genes like KRAS, TP53, SMAD4 and
CDKN2A alter multiple transcriptional pathways in the native pancreatic cells and their microenvironment,
resulting in tumor growth, progression and metastases. Presence or absence of many of these mutations can
modulate the aggressiveness of cancer and the clinical course of patients with PDAC. Studies in other
cancers including colon, breast and prostate cancer, have demonstrated that differing genomic and
transcriptional landscape amongst Caucasians (CA) and AA can explain some of the racial health
disparities with respect the incidence and the outcomes of these cancers. However, such data in the
context of PDAC is lacking. Given that a) genomic-transcriptomic signatures shape PDAC progression and
outcomes; b) AAs and CAs have difference in pancreatic cancer incidence and outcomes irrespective of tumor
stage; and c) race is associated with differential mutational and transcriptional signatures in multiple other
cancers, we have put forth the following hypothesis to explain the racial health disparities in context of PDAC:
Hypothesis: Differences in the genomic and transcriptomic signatures contributes to the disparities in
pancreatic cancer incidence and outcomes between African Americans and Caucasians. Our hypothesis will
be tested through the two specific aims: Aim 1 will be focused on interrogating the mutational landscape of
PDAC using deep whole exome sequencing (WES) on resected tumor specimens of histologically proven
PDAC cases from AA PDAC patients. In addition to testing specific hypotheses about KRAS, we will screen for
potential pathogenic variants (PPVs) which could be contributing significantly to the outcome disparities
between CA and AA PDAC patients. In Aim 2 Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) will be performed on the
cohort of 100 PDAC specimens from AA patients (from aim 1) to identify clinically relevant transcriptional
pathways in AA PDAC tumors in two ways. First, the AA and CA cases will be compared according to our
published PurIST algorithm to understand the incidence of classical/basal tumor subtypes, which predict
response to frontline therapy. Additionally, we will perform De-novo transcriptomic subtyping and pathway
analysis to understand whether AA PDAC tumors harbor distinct transcriptional signatures compared to those
identified previously in CA cases. Successful execution of the current studies will provide, for the first time,
detailed analysis of genetic and transcriptional landscape of PDAC in AAs when compared to CA. These data
will help us better understand the potential reasons of racial health disparities and will help us develop novel
strategies to address these and thus achieve racial health equality."

Overdose deaths are surging in the United States, mainly due to non-medical fentanyl use. Buprenorphine is a
highly effective medication for opioid use disorder (OUD), reducing overdose deaths and other opioid-related
harms. However, uptake of buprenorphine remains low, in part, due to concerns of precipitated withdrawal
among individuals using fentanyl during traditional buprenorphine initiation. To overcome this barrier, clinicians
have begun using Low Dose Initiation (LDI) protocols. LDI protocols introduce small amounts of buprenorphine
that are gradually increased until a therapeutic dose is reached, minimizing risk for precipitated withdrawal.
The San Francisco Outpatient Buprenorphine Induction Clinic (OBIC) has been offering LDI protocols since
2020. Our preliminary findings note that LDI protocols are now the prevailing strategy to initiate buprenorphine
among patients using fentanyl in San Francisco, though successful completion and retention rates remain low.
Substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding barriers to LDI completion and ideal strategies to enhancing LDI
use. The proposed training and research plan for this K23 application will allow Dr. Leslie Suen to acquire the
skills necessary to achieve her career goal of becoming an NIH-funded independent clinician investigator with
expertise in implementation science and developing interventions to improve treatment outcomes for
individuals with OUD. With the guidance of her dedicated mentoring team and rigorous training plan, Dr. Suen
will apply advanced skills in intervention development, mixed methods, and randomized trial design and
evaluation to develop and pilot an Enhanced LDI program. Enhanced LDI will leverage implementation science
frameworks to test various behavioral interventions to increase successful buprenorphine initiation and
retention. Building on Dr. Suen’s prior research in OUD treatment outcomes and LDI use, this proposal
addresses the following aims: 1) identify challenges and barriers to LDI completion using in-depth interviews
with patients, clinicians, and system leaders; 2) design an Enhanced LDI program using focus groups of
patients, practitioners, pharmacists, and other healthcare staff to test strategies for improving buprenorphine
uptake; 3) evaluate the preliminary impact of the Enhanced LDI program on successful initiation and retention
through a 6-month pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with patients with OUD using fentanyl, comparing
Enhanced and Usual LDI treatments. The evaluation will use various data sources to assess successful
initiation, acceptability, and feasibility. This proposal has the goal of improving and developing novel
interventions for OUD treatment in real-world settings, and it aligns with Dr. Suen’s career development plan to
gain expertise in intervention development, mixed methods, and randomized trial and evaluation. The findings
of this proposal will lead to an R01 application to test Enhanced LDI in a full RCT, with the goal of increasing
buprenorphine uptake and reducing overdose deaths."

Background: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is chronic hemolytic anemia that causes irreversible organ damage
resulting in a shortened lifespan. As a pediatric hematologist, my career goal is to utilize implementation science
(IS) and health services research (HSR) methods to address the limitations of the health care system contributing
to the poor outcomes of children and youth with SCD. My previous work, funded by an Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) institutional K12 award, demonstrated that providers often have difficulty in
adhering to standard of care practices for inpatient pediatric SCD management. Complications such as acute
chest syndrome (ACS) could be reduced by an improved understanding of SCD providers’ attitudes and
perceptions and by developing targeted approaches to influence their behavior. Research: In this K08 award
proposal, there are three main aims: 1) to identify the barriers and enablers that healthcare providers face to
provide standard of care to patients with SCD; 2) develop an electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision
support system (CDSS), with employing a user-centered design approach and engaging healthcare providers;
and 3) pilot the CDSS using an IS framework on an inpatient pediatric SCD unit. The COM-B (Capability,
Opportunity, Motivation and Behavior) model will be used to guide design, data collection and analysis plans in
Aim 1 and the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance) framework will guide
evaluation of the implementation outcomes in Aim 3. Training: I recently completed a Master of Science in Clinical
Research Methods which provided excellent introductory-level training in epidemiology, statistics, and principles
of stakeholder-engaged research. This K08 award will leverage my clinical expertise in SCD and provide training
in qualitative methods, IS, bioinformatics, advanced statistical methods and design and analysis of hybrid
effectiveness-implementation trials; these skills are essential to facilitate my transition to research independence.
Environment: The Department Chair of Pediatrics enthusiastically supports my application and ensures that
>75% of my time will be protected for research and education during the award. The Children’s Hospital at
Montefiore, affiliated with the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, is located in the Bronx, NY and has one of the
largest SCD cohorts in New York City. I have an excellent mentorship team of well-established researchers who
have guided my career to date, supported the publication of multiple manuscripts and advised on the preparation
of the K12 and K08 applications. Additional mentors for this proposal will add to the skills I need to become a
successful independent researcher. Long-term goal: My goal is to become an independent National Institutes of
Health-funded HSR investigator who can effectively conduct stakeholder-engaged research and implement
health systems interventions to positively impact the health of SCD patients in the United States."

Training the next generation of neuroscientists studying the brain basis of speech, language, reading, and
communication (referred to as “Brain & Language” throughout this application) presents several key
challenges. First, conducting rigorous Brain & Language research requires a broad conceptual and technical
knowledge base spanning several disciplines. Second, to identify research questions that will make a
positive difference in clinical care, Brain & Language researchers need clinical experience to understand how
communication disorders are diagnosed and treated. Third, to have a career that has a positive impact on
society, Brain & Language researchers must understand the real-world relevance of their research, which
requires engaging with the communities served by their research. Fourth, a successful research career
requires many professional skills and a strong knowledge of ethical principles, including those specific to
Brain & Language research. Finally, because Brain & Language is fundamentally an interdisciplinary field,
trainees require a diverse and inclusive community of scholars to foster collaborations and connections that
they can carry forward into their careers. We aim to provide these essential elements of training.
Georgetown University is ideally suited to train the next generation of leaders in Brain & Language research.
Georgetown has an unusually large Brain & Language faculty who study a wide range of topics. These faculty
include leading figures in the field over the past few decades, along with rising stars of the present. The
faculty have a strong track record of productivity, collaboration, funding, and mentorship. Our trainees are
diverse, competitive, and engaged, and have gone on to productive and successful research careers.
Georgetown faculty also have relationships with many clinical and community partners in the Washington,
DC region, providing a wealth of opportunities for clinical experience, community engagement, and
professional development activities. Within this extraordinary environment, we aim to establish a new Brain &
Language Training Program (BLTP) to provide a unique training experience for predoctoral and postdoctoral
fellows pursuing careers in Brain & Language Neuroscience. To address the career needs identified above, the
BLTP will provide an integrated training program, including: (1) A Curriculum of Coursework designed to
provide a strong cross-disciplinary conceptual and technical knowledge base; (2) Clinical Experience with
communication disorders to help trainees understand the clinical impact of their research; (3) Community
Engagement to foster understanding about how research impacts the community; (4) Training in the
Professional Skills and Ethical Practices necessary for a successful research career; and (5) An
interdisciplinary and diverse Community of Scholars focused on Brain & Language research. This T32 will
provide four slots for PhD students, and four slots for postdoctoral fellows (two per year in each group for two
years each) to participate in this unique and comprehensive training program."
10867304,"Elevated levels of TGFβ2 levels in the trabecular meshwork (TM) are thought to the major cause for the
increased deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) that restricts aqueous humor outflow (AHO) and causes an
elevation in intraocular pressure (IOP) in primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). Yet the pathway(s) that
increase TGFβ2 expression in POAG patients is unclear. We hypothesize that the coordinated activation of
the transcription factor, NFATc1 and a αvβ3 integrin signaling pathway forms a positive feedback loop
that drives the elevated levels of TGFβ2 in POAG. In support of this hypothesis, our studies have shown
that activation of αvβ3 integrin signaling triggers an increase in TGFβ2 expression in human trabecular
meshwork (HTM) cells and that αvβ3 integrin expression is controlled by the transcriptional activity of NFATc1.
Understanding how NFATc1 and αvβ3 integrin activity work together to control TGFβ2 levels is important as it
could demonstrate novel ways (using combinational therapies) to control POAG. Aim#1 will test the
hypothesis that activation of NFATc1 is involved in regulating the expression of TGFβ2 and ECM
proteins in HTM cells and in C57BL/6J mice. Adenoviral (Ad5) vectors expressing a constitutively active
(CA)-NFATc1 will be used to activate NFATc1 in HTM cells and in C57BL/6J mice. Lenti-NFATc1 shRNAs and
a NFATc1flox/flox mouse transduced with Ad5-cre vector will be used to silence NFATc1 expression in vitro and
in vivo, respectively. Dexamethasone or the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, known activators of NFATc1, will be
used to confirm NFATc1 activity and its role in regulating TGFβ2 and ECM expression in HTM cells and in
mice. Changes in TGFβ2 and ECM expression will be measured using immunofluorescence microscopy,
western blots, and PCR. IOP and AHO will be measured using a tonometer, and anterior chamber cannulation,
respectively. Aim#2 will test the hypothesis that αvβ3 integrin activity drives TGFβ2 and ECM
expression by generating a Ca2+-dependent feedback loop coordinated by NFATc1. Ad5 vectors
expressing a CA-αvβ3 integrin or inactive (D119Y) αvβ3 integrin will be used to alter the expression/activity of
αvβ3 integrin in HTM cells and in C57BL/6J mice in vivo. A NFAT-luciferase reporter mouse transduced with
Ad5-αvβ3 integrin or an Ad5-bioactive TGFβ2 transgene will be used to detect the effect of αvβ3 integrin and
TGFβ2 on NFATc1 activity in vivo. The Ca2+-chelator (BAPTA-AM) will be used to inhibit Ca2+ signaling.
Changes in TGFβ2 and ECM expression will be measured as described in aim#1. Aim#3 will test the
hypothesis that mechanical forces associated with an elevated IOP perpetuate the elevation in Ca2+
that increases NFATc1 and αvβ3 integrin activity in the TM. Ex vivo monkey and human anterior segments
will be subjected to elevated pressure. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin will be used to activate NFATc1 while a
Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM) will be used to block it. A Ca2+ indicator, Fura2-AM will be used to measure Ca2+
levels. Changes in TGFβ2, αvβ3 integrin and ECM expression will be measured as described in aim#1"

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an urgent health problem in the U.S., afflicting ~15% of Americans and
costing the healthcare system $120 billion/year. Despite the availability of glucose-normalizing drugs, diabetes
remains the leading cause of renal failure. Current treatments depend on glucose and hypertension control that
cannot completely prevent diabetic nephropathy and progressive renal dysfunction. A major feature of diabetic
nephropathy is inflammation, driven by the upregulation of adhesion proteins in renal endothelium and
subsequent recruitment of inflammatory immune cells into renal tissue. Previous work has shown that knockout
of the adhesion protein ICAM1 attenuates diabetic nephropathy in mouse models of type 1 and 2 diabetes.
However, there is a lack of clinically viable technologies that can act on these findings. An FDA-approved lipid
nanoparticle (LNP) siRNA drug, patisiran, is capable of safely inducing efficient (>80%) and durable (up to one
month) gene knockdown in humans. As LNPs typically accumulate in the liver, this approach has not been
broadly applicable to other tissues. This application seeks to develop new LNPs for efficient siRNA delivery to
renal endothelium, to test the hypothesis that knockdown of ICAM1 is protective against type 1 and 2 diabetic
nephropathy. The goal of Aim 1 (K99 phase) is to identify LNPs capable of efficient siRNA delivery to renal
endothelium through high-throughput in vivo screening. A panel of DNA-barcoded LNPs with varying
compositions will be screened for functional siRNA delivery to the renal endothelium using a new workflow.
Isolated barcodes will be analyzed by deep sequencing to deduce LNP parameters that mediate renal
endothelial delivery and inform subsequent, refined screens. Lead LNPs will be individually validated and
assessed for knockdown efficiency, duration, and safety. During the R00 phase, LNP efficacy will be tested in
multiple models of type 1 and 2 diabetic nephropathy. These models capture human diabetic nephropathy
features of ICAM1 upregulation, albuminuria, renal fibrosis, and macrophage infiltration into renal tissue. LNPs
carrying ICAM1 siRNA will be tested for efficacy in prophylactic (before disease onset) and therapeutic (after
disease onset) models. Successful completion of this work could enable new, precision medicine approaches
that target inflammatory drivers of diabetic nephropathy. The PI, Gary Liu, aims to lead a lab that develops new
renal therapeutics and arrest disease progression. A major focus will be gene therapies for kidney diseases.
To prepare him for this role, this K99/R00 application includes training and coursework in DNA barcoding, deep
sequencing, and bioinformatics; nephrology and diabetic nephropathy; LNP technology; and inclusive
mentoring. Moreover, this application will enable the PI to disseminate work at conferences, network, and
apply for faculty positions. Training will occur at the Koch Institute of MIT in the laboratories of Profs. Robert
Langer and Giovanni Traverso, which will provide the resources and intellectual expertise necessary to carry
out the work."

Early detection of cognitive decline in older adults (OA) is a public health priority. The pathology of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) begins more than 20 years before memory loss develops, but dementia diagnoses often occur
late in the process of cognitive decline. AD is a progressive disease and early detection of cognitive decline
may slow disease progression by providing appropriate treatments earlier. There is growing evidence to
suggest the possibility that depression in OA is a risk factor for cognitive decline and AD, potentially acting
through perceived stress. However, it remains unknown whether depression in OA is a prodrome, a cause, or a
consequence of cognitive decline. Moreover, we often rely on cognitive assessments in the lab, and could
instead leverage real-world behaviors to detect early shifts in cognition. This study seeks to fill this knowledge
gap through three aims: (Aim 1) identification of cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between
cognitive performance, perceived stress, and psychiatric symptoms in an existing sample from the Indiana
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center; (Aim 2) development of natural language processing algorithms to
detect and quantify risk factors for depression in midlife and OA; and (Aim 3) ecological momentary
assessment of the daily cognitive functioning, emotions, and stress in OA, using validated mobile cognitive
tasks. Completion of these aims will provide a test of the relationship between cognitive aging and depression
in OA using a multimodal approach. Dr. Rutter's overarching K01 career development goal is to develop a
naturalistic paradigm for early detection of cognitive decline. Aim 1 will define the theoretical framework for this
paradigm; Aims 2 and 3 then apply this framework to real-world stimuli to determine whether these provide
more sensitive measures of detecting cognitive decline. The integrated training and research plans proposed
here will provide Dr. Rutter with advanced training in several critical areas needed to position here as an expert
on aging. The mentorship and guidance from her team of national leaders will allow Dr. Rutter to achieve
targeted training in the following domains: (1) cognitive aging, AD, depression and wellbeing in OA, and
technology use in OA (Krendl & Holden), (2) natural language processing approaches to understanding risk
factors for depression in midlife and OA (Bollen), (3) implementation of ecological momentary assessment and
analysis of intensive longitudinal cognitive data in OA (Finn & Germine), and (4) career development skills in
grantsmanship, leadership, and research (Krendl, Holden, & Hawkins). These training objectives will be
achieved through a combination of coursework, conferences, workshops, directed readings, mentorship
meetings, and completion of the primary K01 study. Indiana University Bloomington provides an outstanding
environment for these training and research objectives. This K01 award will provide an essential bridge
between Dr. Rutter's prior training and research experience, and her career goal of becoming an independently
funded researcher who specializes in the interplay of depression and pathological cognitive aging."

The 29.3 million patients receiving care in US Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) have much lower
cervical cancer screening rates than national averages: Only 53% of eligible patients were up-to-date in 2021
and the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these disparities. Self-sampling for human papillomavirus (HPV) is
an evidence-based cervical cancer screening method with high potential to reduce screening barriers. Self-
sampling kits can be distributed at clinics or mailed to patients' homes. Despite widespread international
adoption, HPV self-sampling is nascent in the US. Little data is available to inform implementing this preventive
service in low-resource settings such as FQHCs. Our two-phase pilot and pragmatic trial will adapt and
evaluate two programs to integrate HPV self-sampling into FQHCs. Our trial accounts for the context, capacity
and resources of FQHCs, and leverages FQHC-Medicaid partnerships to promote this preventive care service.
Phase 1 will be a milestone-driven planning phase. We will use community-based participatory research and
stakeholder input to adapt and pilot-test 2 multilevel interventions in 2 FQHCs for distributing HPV self-
sampling kits: in clinics and in clinics plus direct mailing. Phase 2 will be a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in
42 Oregon and Washington FQHC clinics to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
the interventions. Clinics will be randomized to Usual Care (UC), in-clinic distribution (Clinic Only), or in-clinic
plus mailed distribution (Clinic + Mail). For in-clinic distribution, providers will offer self-sampling at in-person or
telehealth encounters. The mailed component will be administered by Medicaid health plans. The primary
outcome is the proportion of eligible patients (30-64 years, due/overdue for routine screening) who complete
screening. Co-primary comparisons are (1) UC vs Clinic Only and (2) Clinic Only vs Clinic + Mail. To minimize
bias, each comparison includes distinct but overlapping patient populations. Comparison 1 includes all patients
(Medicaid and non-Medicaid) with a clinic encounter during the 12-month study period. Comparison 2 is
restricted to Medicaid patients who are enrolled with the clinic, but does not require a clinic encounter during
the 12-month study period. Cost-effectiveness will compare the Clinic Only HPV self-sampling intervention
relative to UC, and Clinic + Mail relative to Clinic Only. We will use the RE-AIM framework and PRISM to
assess provider, clinic and health plan acceptability and evaluate adaptations to the implementation strategies
through mixed methods. Our pragmatic trial will be the first in the US to determine the effectiveness and cost-
effectiveness of HPV self-sampling for increasing cervical cancer screening in FQHC settings. Results from our
comparisons and evaluation of implementation strategies will inform broad-scale implementation of HPV self-
sampling across FQHCs and other safety-net clinics in the US to reduce cervical cancer screening disparities."

Pediatric Pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a progressive and incurable disease hallmarked by abnormal
development, muscularization and blockage of small pulmonary vessels by the formation of obstructive
‘neointimal lesions’. While most research has focused on arterial disease, venous changes including neointima,
are described in nearly all forms of PPH but little is known about what controls vein neointima formation. Available
therapies do not target lesion growth, neither prevent nor reverse disease, and are contraindicated when vein
remodeling predominates. Early evidence suggests novel heterogeneity among pulmonary vascular smooth
muscle cells (VSMCs) and neointima, but the molecular control and contribution of these subsets in PPH remains
unknown. Understanding the biology of post-capillary vascular remodeling and, more generally, how
heterogeneous VSMC and neointimal subsets contribute to PPH has the potential to significantly advance the
understanding of the cellular and molecular controls of pathologic vascular remodeling in PPH. In Aim 1, Dr. Lea
Steffes will train with mentors Dr. Maya Kumar in mouse transgenics, cutting-edge imaging and quantitation
techniques and Dr. Mark Krasnow in advanced biocomputational analysis to define transcriptomic heterogeneity
between pre- and post-capillary neointima and provide the first genomic-wide characterization of vein neointima.
In addition to an in vivo pharmacologic inhibition study in mice using tools developed and published by Drs.
Steffes and Kumar, in Aim 2, Dr. Steffes will train with advisor Dr. David Cornfield to perform a broad in vitro
screen of VSMC growth modulators on vein neointima cells. With training in human pulmonary vascular
histopathology from advisors Drs. Serena Tan and Csaba Galambos, Aim 3 will connect Dr. Steffes’s research
and clinical expertise by interrogating the role of two novel developmental VSMC subsets in heritable PPH. The
Candidate Training Plan provides a complimentary skillset of in vitro investigation, bio-computational analysis,
and human lung vascular histopathology training to interrogate the cell-specific behaviors and molecular
signatures of pathologic cell types (vein neointima, Aims 1&2 and developmental VSMC subsets, Aim3) integral
to PPH. Mentor Dr. Maya Kumar is a thought-leader in the use of advanced mouse genetics and genomic tools
to interrogate pathologic pulmonary vascular biology. Co-mentor Dr. Mark Krasnow (single cell analysis) and
advisors Dr. David Cornfield (in vitro analysis) and Dr. Serena Tan (human lung histopathology) and Dr. Csaba
Galambos (pediatric PPH pathology) offer complementary expertise. The environment at Stanford University is
renowned for collaborative and innovative research. Supported by this infrastructure, candidate Dr. Steffes has
demonstrated tremendous academic growth with 9 publications including 5 as first-author since 2020. In
summary, this strong mentoring environment and training plan are anticipated to fully prepare Dr. Steffes to
launch her independent career. The proposed studies will offer mechanistic insights into pediatric pulmonary
vascular pathogenesis, and may identify therapeutic targets to improve the lives of children with PPH."

Multi-drug resistance to conventional antibiotics is precipitating a medical crisis. An estimated 3
trillion in costs and excess loss of 10 million lives is expected by 2050. The chemical antibiotic
pipeline has run dry, disincentivized by the rapid development of resistance and lack of financial
gain after product development. Phage therapy has emerged as a viable treatment alternative,
where bacteriophage (phage for short), which are viruses that only infect bacteria, are used as
naturally adaptive drugs to treat infections that no longer respond to currently available
antibiotics. However, bacteria also mutate to resist phage infections, which limits treatment.
Unlike antibiotics, phage can counter-adapt to these bacterial mutations, thereby killing so-
called “resistors.” This raises the possibility of developing phage cocktails populated with phage
that “anticipate” the resistance trajectories of bacteria and thus limit or prevent resistance
altogether. For this purpose, we have developed a co-culture system that maintains continuous
logarithmic bacterial growth so as to maximize phage production on a permissive bacterial host,
thereby facilitating the emergence of rare phage variants that “train” to kill target resistors in a
secondary vessel. Hypothesizing that this system will allow us to chart all resistor mutations for
a given bacterial species and counter-adaptations by phage, the aims of this work are to
optimize the growth parameters to maximize novel evolutionary adaptations for both agents. In
Aim 1, we study the effect of nutritional status, aeration, temperature, and the bacterial/viral
propagation strains in driving lineages of adaptation, both in the presence and absence of
chemical and genetic mutators. For Aim 2, we sequence all lineages that emerge every 6 hours
for 7 weeks (~ one evolutionary cycle) to chart the mutations for bacteria-phage interactions to
identify how resistance undermines phage therapy and phages that will contribute to anti-
resistor cocktails. With this knowledge, we can develop phage cocktails that block common
avenues for bacteria to escape phage treatment."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) are leading causes of pain and disability. While
treatment with biologic agents may improve outcomes, treatment failure is common in patients who are obese.
Despite the significant impact of treatment failure, it is currently unknown if the poor drug response in obesity is
due to physiologic changes altering drug pharmacokinetics (PK)/Pharmacodynamics (PD), the underlying
inflammatory state, or both. Dr. Balevic proposes to respond to this need by 1) characterizing the effects of
obesity on disease activity and biomarkers of inflammation in a prospective observational study in RA and JIA;
2) using PK/PD modeling to investigate the effect of obesity on drug levels for a probe biologic agent, and
relate drug levels to disease activity; and 3) using the PK/PD model to evaluate an optimal dosing strategy in a
PK/PD clinical trial. This Mentored Career Development Award will provide a structured learning environment
and expert mentorship to enable Dr. Stephen Balevic to develop as an independent investigator and future
leader in the field of therapeutics for adults and children with rheumatic disease. Dr. Balevic’s overarching
career goal is to optimize the dosing, safety, and effectiveness of medications by integrating clinical
pharmacology and PK/PD modeling with drug trials. To achieve this goal, Dr. Balevic created a career
development plan that capitalizes on the longstanding collaboration between Duke University, where he is
junior faculty in the Divisions of Adult and Pediatric Rheumatology/Duke Clinical Research Institute, and the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he is pursuing a PhD in Pharmaceutical Sciences. In
addition, Dr. Balevic will enhance his training in the regulatory conduct of clinical trials through a unique
training agreement with the FDA. His short-term goals for the K23 program are: 1) to acquire advanced
knowledge and skills in PK/PD modeling; 2) develop the professional skills and techniques to lead a clinical
trials team; and 3) generate a critical mass of preliminary data and publications to support an R01 grant
application. The mentorship team has a history of prior collaboration, a proven record of successful mentorship
of junior faculty, and has internationally recognized expertise in biomarkers of drug response, obesity, PK/PD
modeling, and clinical trials. Upon successful completion of this proposal, Dr. Balevic will have acquired the
necessary skillset to pursue a lifelong career in promoting safe and effective use of drugs in adults and children
with rheumatic disease."

Health disparities have endured for centuries. The disparity in research for biological variations is even greater,
where the explosion of genetic and environmental data has focused almost exclusively on those of European
ancestry (EA). In neuroscience and genomics, individuals with recent African ancestry (AA) account for less
than 5% of large-scale genomic studies but are 20% more likely to experience a major mental health crisis. To
compound this issue further, studies have linked genetic differences between AA and EA for divergent
responses to antipsychotics. As a result, large-scale studies for neuropsychiatric disorders have limited
diagnostic accuracy for non-European ancestry individuals, hindering the development of effective equitable
neurotherapeutics and potentially increasing health disparities. Despite the clear urgent need, there are no
large-scale studies examining genetic or regulatory differences between AA and EA in the human brain. This
proposal seeks to address this gap in research by comparing AA with well-studied EA individuals. The initial
goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and regulatory difference between AA (n=784) and EA (n=678) in
postmortem caudate nucleus (n=420), dentate gyrus (n=161), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (n=434), and
hippocampus (n=447), compiled from one of the largest postmortem brain collections of psychiatric disorders.
This diverse large-scale postmortem brain tissue will allow us to test the hypotheses of genetic variations
influence on brain region-specific transcriptional and epigenetic changes for ancestry across prenatal and
postnatal life. This MOSAIC (Maximizing Opportunities for Scientific and Academic Independent Careers)
Postdoctoral Career Transition Award to Promote Diversity will be supported by excellent career development
resources at the Lieber Institute for Brain Development and Johns Hopkins University, and training from a
mentoring team of globally recognized experts in the fields of human genetics and advanced statistical
methods. It will provide a first of its kind examination of ancestry in neuroscience, which will advance our
understanding of genetic variation in the human brain."

This is a competing renewal application for the North Carolina Occupational Safety and Health Education and Research
Center (NC OSHERC). Our unique Center builds upon the strengths of the occupational health and safety (OHS) education
and research programs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University, and North Carolina State
University. Nearly 62% of US adults are employed, and work exerts an independent, powerful influence on their health and
safety. As we conducted needs and strengths assessments in preparation for this Center proposal, we saw how the COVID-
19 pandemic created a massive re-shaping of work, work conditions, and worker health, particularly related to safety, mental
health, and well-being among essential and underserved workers. This observation has strengthened our joint efforts with
both our regional Education and Research Center colleagues and other OHS partners to serve the emerging needs of
occupational health professionals and the diverse workforce. The guiding mission of the NC OSHERC is to provide high-
quality education and research training in the OHS sciences for the protection and promotion of worker health and well-
being and to prevent occupational illness and injury in North Carolina, the southeast region, and the nation. To fulfill this
mission, our goals are to (1) train future leaders to meet the nation’s OHS research needs and NIOSH priority goals and (2)
bridge the gap between the innovative research being conducted in OHS within the regional universities and the needs of
the region’s workforce. We will accomplish these goals through interdisciplinary OHS training, research, and service. The
proposed education and research program’s specific aims are to:
1. Train practitioners, educators, and researchers in the academic disciplines of occupational exposure science and industrial
 hygiene, occupational medicine, safety and ergonomics, occupational epidemiology, and Total Worker Healthâ, with a
 specific focus given to training diverse, underrepresented, and minority practitioners and researchers.
2. Provide interdisciplinary learning experiences through coursework, practice and field projects, research activities, and
 seminars. Academic training and targeted research training programs guide trainees to develop skills in scientific inquiry
 and research to practice (r2p) to mitigate and eliminate hazards and improve working conditions.
3. Provide outreach and continuing education training programs to meet the needs of practitioners and OHS stakeholders.
4. Fund pilot research projects to support the development of young investigators and advance OHS science.
The NC OSHERC is uniquely positioned to increase capacity and address the future challenges of OHS training, research,
and preparedness in the Southeast and the nation by training diverse OHS practitioners and professionals in the challenging
interdisciplinary OHS field and by fostering greater collaboration between academic researchers, local, state, and federal
occupational professionals, as well as business and industry sector stakeholders. The NC OSHERC’s overall program
responds to mandates in the OSHA Act, section 2(b)(5) and addresses the National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA)
2019 – 2024 priorities and critically important OHS issues in the NORA sector and cross-sector areas."
10893767,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Medicaid is a key player in the care of individuals living with serious mental illness (SMI). Despite its high
costs, Medicaid-funded SMI care is characterized by low quality and inequities. Although state Medicaid
programs have implemented policies to improve quality or value of care for high-need beneficiaries including
those with SMI, policymakers lack the necessary information to develop, target, implement, and evaluate these
policies. For example, the associations between person- and area-level characteristics and quality of SMI care
are not well understood, precluding the targeting of corrective interventions. Moreover, concerns have been
raised about SMI quality measurement, with some arguing that available process-based indicators do not
cover key areas of SMI care and may not be associated with key patient outcomes, both health outcomes
(e.g., suicidality) and social outcomes (e.g., homelessness). Crucially, the quality and cost effects of the broad
adoption of telehealth to deliver mental health care following the COVID-19 pandemic are not well understood,
nor are its effects on disparities. Last, because little is known about the relationships between quality, health
and social outcomes, and Medicaid and other costs or their interplay with race/ethnicity, policymakers lack a
full understanding of the state budgetary and societal impacts of interventions to improve the quality and equity
of SMI care. Our proposed research seeks to fill these evidence gaps hindering policymakers’ efforts to
improve quality, equity, and value of SMI care. We will leverage an ongoing partnership with the New York
State Medicaid program’s mental health authority, availability of several patient-level datasets, and subject
matter and methods expertise. Aim 1 will identify person- and area-level predictors of quality of care and
determine if the associations vary by race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will estimate the effects of receipt of high-quality
care on health and social outcomes and determine if the effects vary by race/ethnicity. Aim 3 will estimate the
effects of telehealth on quality of mental health care and costs to Medicaid and determine if the effects vary by
race/ethnicity. Aim 4 will develop alternative quality-improving interventions and compare their effects on
health and social outcomes, Medicaid and broader state spending, and racial/ethnic equity. Our proposed
research is responsive to PAR-23-095 and aligned with the NIMH Strategic Plan’s Goal 4 because, among
other tasks, we will (a) identify mutable factors that are likely to influence disparities in quality and outcomes for
underserved groups, (b) use large representative data sets and novel computational approaches to improve
mental health care and its outcomes, and (c) evaluate the impacts of an innovation (telehealth). Successful
completion of our aims will provide policymakers with race/ethnicity-infused evidence regarding (a) groups to
be targeted for interventions to improve quality of care, (b) the effects of high-quality care on key patient
outcomes, (c) the effects of telemental health policies, and (d) the comparative effects of alternative quality-
improving interventions on outcomes of high significance to patients, state policymakers, and society."

Progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) is debilitating with poor prognosis. Antifibrotic therapies in PPF slow
progression but do not reverse or stabilize disease. Thus, timing of therapy is key to improving outcomes,
especially if started in presymptomatic stages prior to lung function decline. To prove the efficacy of early therapy,
clinical trials will require prognostic enrichment with biomarkers to accurately identify presymptomatic individuals
at high risk of developing PPF. Interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) on CT are linked to increased risk of PPF, but
not all ILAs will progress (progression rate ~30-60%) and CT is unable to distinguish ILAs that will progress to
PPF from those that are of no clinical consequence. The main limitation of CT is its resolution, which is insufficient
to detect microscopic features. Surgical lung biopsy (SLB) provides tissue for microscopy, but has high
morbidity/mortality risks. Over the last 10 years, we have developed and validated endobronchial optical
coherence tomography (EB-OCT) as a safe, minimally-invasive imaging modality to assess lung disease, with
microscopic resolution 200x higher than CT in tissue volumes 100x larger than SLB. We have established that
the subpleural space of both lungs can be practically and rapidly (10 sites in <10 min) evaluated in early PPF
using EB-OCT, with 100% sensitivity/specificity for early lung fibrosis as compared to SLB, without adverse
events. We have additionally developed and validated artificial intelligence methods for automated segmentation
and volumetric quantification of microscopic features on EB-OCT with sensitivity/specificity >0.9, allowing for
broad implementation of this technology to define an individual patient’s risk for ILA progression to PPF. With
these major developments in EB-OCT, we finally can safely investigate microscopic disease features in ILA that
may predict progression to PPF. In a preliminary cohort of ILA subjects, we identified high-risk features of early
architectural distortion by EB-OCT that predicted progression of ILA to PPF. Our compelling premise and
preliminary data support our central hypothesis that individuals with ILA who will progress to PPF have high-risk
microscopic features, defined as destructive fibrosis with microscopic honeycombing or traction bronchiolectasis,
that are detectable by EB-OCT. We are uniquely positioned to test this hypothesis due to our expertise in EB-
OCT and access to two large ILA cohorts with annual follow-up (with CT and PFT) to assess long-term outcomes
through our lung nodule CT screening program (smokers with ILA; Cohort 1) and existing ILA cohort (subjects
with ILA and family history of PPF; Cohort 2). In Aim 1, we will determine the accuracy of microscopic features,
as detected by EB-OCT, to predict progression to PPF in two independent ILA cohorts. In Aim 2, we will define
and validate an integrative prediction model for progression of ILA to PPF that combines EB-OCT, CT and
plasma biomarkers associated with PPF disease progression. Cohort 1 will serve as the derivation cohort and
Cohort 2 as a separate, de novo validation cohort. These foundational studies will enable prognostic enrichment
for future clinical trials evaluating early therapy in presymptomatic PPF, with potential to impact disease mortality."

Lymphedema, which results from the failure of the lymphatic system to properly drain fluid, proteins, lipids, and
immune cells from the interstitium of the skin, leads to irreversible tissue remodeling including fibrosis, swelling,
and lipid accumulation. It occurs most commonly in the US as a result of cancer treatment. In breast cancer
almost 1 in 3 survivors develop lymphedema and the presence has persisted in spite of reductions to the
aggressiveness of cancer therapy achieved through sentinel lymph node biopsy. Being diagnosed with
lymphedema remains a life sentence as there is no cure. In this project, a new therapeutic paradigm for treating
lymphedema will be explored using pre-clinical models of surgically induced disease.
The objective of this program is to further develop and optimize a lymphatic-targeting sustained drug delivery
system for lymphedema therapy. Different types of lymphatic pump function modulators [L-type calcium channel
activator and potassium channel blocker] and two classes of immunomodulators that ameliorate lymphedema-
induced inflammation [inhibitors of calcineurin and transforming growth factor beta], and synergies in improving
the benefits of vascularized lymph node transfer will be tested. The single vessel ligation mouse model of
lymphedema will be used as, in contrast to genetic models, it is not plagued by transgene-associated immune
deficiencies and closely resembles the pathophysiology of human disease. Utilizing unique dual-wavelength
near infrared imaging capabilities, lymphatic function and drug biodistribution over disease progression and
therapy will be tracked. This will be achieved through three specific aims: Aim 1 will focus on lymphatic delivery
and effects of drugs restoring lymphatic pump function. Aim 2 will harness methods of sustained delivery into
locoregional tissues as well as lymphatic delivery to lymph nodes to determine the effects of immune modulatory
cargos on the immune cell populations within the draining lymph node, the resulting pathology in the
lymphedematous tissue, and the consequences to lymphatic function. Aim 3 will investigate the combined
delivery of lymphatic function bolstering or immune modulatory agents in a model of chronic lymphedema and
synergies in combination with vascular lymph node transplant, the only existing investigational surgical
intervention for lymphedema. The expected outcome of this project is a therapeutic regime for improving
lymphatic function in the treatment of lymphedema, replacing watch-and-wait philosophy with low-dose (but
focused) drugs that support lymphatic transport functions."
10885322,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Improving vascular health is a potential strategy to delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related
dementias (ADRD). The overlap of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and AD pathology may be the most
common neuropathologic phenotype of age-related dementia. However, rarely do imaging studies of ADRD
include measures of SVD commonly observed on brain MRI scans in older adults. Due to challenges in
quantification in large cohort studies, manual reads are typically done; these are very time-consuming, prone to
human error, and lack spatial anatomic resolution. This distinction is most apparent in the Clinical Core studies
of NIH-funded Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs), where SVD biomarkers are technically
challenging, time-consuming, and often overlooked. Filling this critical gap will require technologies to robustly
identify SVD lesions on brain MRI. Recent technological advances make computerized SVD biomarkers
possible, reproducible, and feasible for large cohorts. Using various MRI pulse sequences, we have developed
novel deep-learning methods to accurately quantify SVD biomarkers, including cerebral microbleeds, white
matter hyperintensities, and enlarged perivascular spaces. These reading methods are reliable and offer greater
anatomic precision and dynamic range than previous scoring systems. Thus, our primary aim is to create an
inter-ADRC set of objectively measured SVD MRI biomarkers from large and diverse clinical cohorts to determine
the role of SVD in vascular contributions to ADRD. These ADRCs include 4,831 (49% minority) individuals at
risk for ADRD. We will use the rich clinical and neuroimaging (structural MRI) data within the South Texas, Wake
Forest, Wisconsin, and the University of California Davis ADRCs and their affiliated cohorts, including the
Vascular Contributions to Cognitive Impairment and Dementia consortium, the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis, and The Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention to address unanswered questions
related to the contribution of SVD to ADRD. We will apply our deep learning models to address the following
Specific Aims: 1) Standardize quantification of cerebral SVD markers in diverse cohorts to allow objective
readings from neuroimaging data currently missing in the ADRCs. 2) Relate cerebral SVD lesions with clinical
cognitive staging, ADRD neuroimaging, and biofluid biomarkers in diverse ADRC cohorts. 3) Explore vascular
and metabolic pathways linking SVD to worse cognition and longitudinal cognitive decline in the context of ADRD
biomarkers. Further, we will share our robust machine learning models and implementation software with the
scientific community. This foundational work will produce and validate computerized methods for SVD
characterization and build a much-needed resource to assess vascular contributions to cognitive impairment in
AD/ADRD research in under-represented populations. Furthermore, this project will provide evidence for
reproducible and harmonized SVD outcomes critical to understanding the complexity of ADRD for adoption by
ADRC MRI research studies, which would be scalable with future grant-supported initiatives.

10885321,"More than 300,000 surgical or endovascular lower extremity revascularization procedures are performed
annually for Medicare beneficiaries who have lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) without limb
threatening ischemia, and rates of these procedures are increasing. In these patients, revascularization
typically improves, but does not eliminate, PAD related walking impairment. Lower extremity revascularization
combined with supervised exercise significantly improves walking performance compared to revascularization
alone in people who have PAD without limb threatening ischemia. However, supervised exercise is
inaccessible or burdensome for most PAD patients. We hypothesize that home-based exercise combined with
lower extremity revascularization will significantly improve walking performance compared to revascularization
alone in patients with PAD undergoing revascularization for disabling PAD.
 We further hypothesize that inorganic nitrate, a major source of nitric oxide (NO) abundant in beetroot juice,
will improve walking performance after lower extremity revascularization, compared to placebo. In preclinical
models, NO inhibits inflammation, neointimal hyperplasia, thrombosis, and vascular smooth muscle cell
migration at sites of revascularization. NO increases angiogenesis and perfusion, repairs skeletal muscle
damaged by ischemia, and stimulates mitochondrial activity. A large body of evidence, assembled over more
than 25 years, supports our hypothesis that inorganic nitrate (such as that in nitrate-rich beetroot juice) will
improve walking performance and other lower extremity outcomes after lower extremity revascularization.
 Effective, accessible, and safe therapies are needed to enhance the benefits and improve durability of
lower extremity revascularization. Therefore, in a randomized clinical trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design, we will
test the following two primary hypotheses in 386 patients randomized within three months of a successful lower
extremity revascularization for disabling PAD: First, that home-based exercise combined with lower extremity
revascularization will improve six-minute walk distance more than revascularization alone at 6-month follow-up
(Primary Aim #1). Second, that nitrate-rich beetroot juice combined with lower extremity revascularization will
improve six-minute walk, compared to placebo combined with revascularization at 6-month follow-up (Primary
Aim #2). In Secondary Aims, we will establish whether home-based exercise, compared to control, and
whether nitrate-rich beetroot juice, compared to placebo, improve the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and
the PROMIS Mobility Questionnaire and prevent hemodynamic failure of the revascularized vessel. In
exploratory aims, we will test the effects of the interventions on plasma nitric oxide bioavailability and on
gastrocnemius muscle biopsy measures of capillary density, myofiber size, and mitochondrial activity. If our
hypotheses are correct, results of this trial will have a major impact on improving mobility in the large and
growing number of people undergoing revascularization for disabling PAD."

Instrumentation Module
The Instrumentation Module provides design, fabrication and modification capabilities for project-specific,
customized and software-flexible vision research apparatuses that are not commercially available. During the
past five years, the Module fabricated many in-house, tailor-fitted and specially-designed devices that have
played crucial roles in generating many high-impact and innovative vision research results. In the next grant
period, this Module will continue its indispensable role in supporting vision research projects by providing new
mechanical, electronic, optic and computer-based design and fabrication services and to develop highly
innovative, high-impact research tools, such as the chronically implanted recording chambers, the customized
in-house construction of a 8-patch-electrode micromanipulator/recording system, two-photon microscope
systems, LED white-noise stimulating system, and the forced-choice, optokinetic reflex machine. All these
devices will be constructed and repeatedly modified, fitted and adjusted before and during experiments by the
in-house machine shop and electronic/optics/computer shop. Therefore the Instrumentation Module is not only
a necessity of many Vision Core labs, but also an integrated part of the research process and scientific

10896168,"Chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is a major cause of renal allograft rejection. Yet
despite its clinical importance an integrated understanding of how responses to antibody and
complement mediated attack are regulated by the transplanted kidney has not been established.
This gap in our knowledge is due at least in part to an incomplete understanding of responses
made by the kidney that result in gene regulation promote or prevent injury. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
are a class of small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.
miRNAs play an important role in regulating renal injury. However, the study of miRNAs in
rejection and renal injury has largely been based on analysis of total cellular miRNAs that are
differentially expressed during disease. This approach is problematic because it does not provide
information on the mRNAs targeted by these miRNAs. To address this issue, we asked whether
it is possible to isolate miRNAs and the mRNAs they are targeting in the RNA-Induced Silencing
Complex (RISC) by isolating RNAs cross-linked to the RNA Binding Protein (RBP) AGO2. Using
this approach we defined the first miRNA-mRNA interaction map for transplant related renal injury.
These proof-of-principle studies revealed that within the miRNA-mRNA targetome it is possible to
defined miRNAs and the mRNAs they target that undergo unique changes in cells undergoing
injury. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that miRNAs present in the RISC complex target
mRNAs encoding proteins in pathways that may contribute to injury. Based on these studies, we
hypothesize that the miRNA-mRNA targetome can be used to identify gene pathways that
contribute to AMR. To test this hypothesis, we will use a clinically relevant murine model to
determine the miRNA-mRNA map for AMR and use information elucidated by the targetome to
examine gene pathways under regulation by miRNAs. We examine the clinical relevance of our
findings by examining whether similar changes occur in human kidney transplants. These studies
will provide unique insight into process that drive pathology associated with AMR, information that
could be used to distinguish AMR from other types of injury, and provides a novel resource to the
transplantation and wider scientific community."

 2 Despite recent advances in cancer care, many cancer patients will ultimately die from their disease as cancer
 3 is the second leading cause of death among men and women in the U.S. As such, many cancer patients will
 4 ultimately be left to plan for a multitude of end of life care needs. To date, most interventions have focused
 5 solely on assisting cancer patients with their advance care planning, neglecting the large number of other tasks
 6 patients must complete to get their affairs in order prior to end of life. Most patients report that what matters
 7 most to them in preparing for their end of life is not only advance care planning, but also resolving emotional,
 8 relational, and spiritual issues; not being a burden to their family, and having their financial affairs in order.
 9 Despite the overwhelming number of tasks that patients have to complete prior to their end of life, there are
10 very limited tools or resources to easily guide patients through this process. Our proposed web-based program
11 intervention, which utilizes the Goal-Setting Theory of Motivation as a framework, is designed to guide patients
12 through all of the necessary tasks needed to comprehensively plan for end of life in a easy to follow checklist
13 with assistance and explicit details on how to complete each task. The goals of this study are to: (1) field-test
14 the web-based program intervention among cancer patients using “Think Aloud” exercises, usability testing
15 protocols, and an iterative design approach and (2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability, satisfaction,
16 user engagement, and preliminary efficacy of the finalized version of the web-based program among cancer
17 patients to improve patients’ levels of engagement in end of life planning (checklist of completed items across
18 the end of life planning domains); patients’ distress and emotional, financial, social, and spiritual well-being. To
19 meet these goals, we will refine the intervention based on stakeholder feedback from n=10 cancer patients and
20 n=10 caregivers to refine the web-based program. Next, we will enroll n=15 advanced cancer patients in an
21 open trial of the intervention to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability, satisfaction, and user
22 engagement of the modified version of the intervention. Finally, we we will randomize n=50 cancer patients to
23 the intervention group and n=50 cancer patients to the control group (usual care) and assess outcomes at
24 baseline and 4 weeks post-intervention to determine the preliminary efficacy of the intervention. Grounded in
25 the Goal-Setting Theory of Motivation, the proposed research takes the novel approach of utilizing digital
26 health platforms (e.g., web-based program) to assist patients in a comprehensive approach to end of life
27 planning. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we expect our contribution to be a fully
28 developed and tested intervention tailored to cancer patients that demonstrates feasibility, acceptability,
29 satisfaction, and potential efficacy at improving engagement in comprehensive end-of-life care planning."
10896277,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Achieving selectivity in complexity-building transformations is critical for being able to access target molecules
with potential to impact human health such has potential drugs and chemical probes for studying biological
systems. Although significant strides have been made in developing chemical methods for complexity-building
reactions, it often remains challenging to carry out these transformations with high levels of chem-, site- and
stereoselectivity on complex or functional group dense molecules. In contrast to small molecule catalysts and
reagents, enzymes often have evolved to carry out reactions with high levels of selectivity. The discovery of
specific enzymatic reactions and development of the utility of these catalysts has the potential to enable to
synthetic strategies and grant us access to new molecules with potent biological activity. This proposal
describes several strategies for developing robust enzyme-mediated reactions and leveraging these tools for
the streamlined synthesis of molecules with pharmaceutical potential.
The goal of this NIGMS proposal is to provide synthetic chemists with highly selective, efficient, well-
characterized and sustainable biocatalytic methods to be planned into synthetic approaches toward target
molecules. Using enzymes from natural product biosynthetic pathways and targeted protein families as a
starting point, we will elucidate the natural chemical function and mechanism of a given enzyme. From this
initial benchmark, we use bioinformatic tools, structural analysis, computational modeling, and evolutionary
approaches to assemble panels of complementary biocatalysts of utility to the synthetic community. We
subsequently seek to use the platform provided by each protein class to design new reactions and apply these
methods to the streamlined synthesis of molecules relevant to human health. My group seeks biocatalytic
solutions to reactions that continue to challenge modern synthetic chemists including selective C–H
hydroxylation, site- and stereoselective oxidative dearomatization, and the chemo- and stereoselective
derivatization of a-amino acids. Moving forward, we continue to work in these areas and are seeking to
develop biocatalytic C–C bond forming reactions, C–H functionalization reactions beyond hydroxylation, and
strategies for building and elaborating functional group dense molecules such as nucleotides.
In summary, this proposal describes the development of chemo-, site- and stereoselective transformations
mediated by enzymes. These methods will directly enable the synthesis of complex biologically active
molecules relevant to human health."

Most human diseases and traits are complex quantitative traits, involving a large number of genes, DNA
sequence variants and environmental factors, and the complex interactions among them. Despite remarkable
progress in high resolution genetic mapping, our understanding of how sequence variants cause phenotypic
variation remains incomplete. Recent studies incorporating intermediate molecular phenotypes including RNA,
protein, and metabolite abundances have facilitated functional delineation of associations between DNA
variants and complex quantitative traits in humans and model organisms. However, although mRNA translation
is a critical biological process, how natural sequence variation may lead to genetic variation in translational
control and how this level of regulatory variation can contribute to within-population and between-species
diversity remain to be understood. Using Drosophila embryos as a model system, we propose to fill this gap by
1) quantifying and mapping genetic variation of translation efficiency among embryos at multiple stages from
inbred strains of a fully sequenced and deeply phenotyped Drosophila melanogaster population; 2) mapping
genes whose cis or trans regulatory variation contributes to between-species divergence in translation
efficiency; and 3) developing a massively parallel reporter assay to systematically test effects of cis regulatory
variation on mRNA translation. These comprehensive studies, when integrated with existing data in the widely
used study population, provide a characterization of the genotype-phenotype maps in unprecedented details.
They will significantly advance our understanding of how DNA variants contribute to phenotypic variation within
and between species, including variation in disease risks among individuals in human populations."
10896356,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More research is being published now than any other time in history and that research is accessible worldwide.
Due to the rapid proliferation of research, it can be difficult if not impossible for an individual to stay abreast of
important findings which can impact research and evidence-based practice. Yet, having a comprehensive
understanding of the literature is foundational to advancing knowledge. This allows a researcher to identify
existing gaps in knowledge so that they can design new research to advance the area forward. One way to
achieve this is through a rigorous evidence synthesis, or a systematic approach to gathering and analyzing
results from multiple sources. In practice, the use of evidence syntheses requires improvement, as they are often
poorly conducted and reported, which has serious downstream impacts on public health. While there are ample
resources currently available to researchers on the topic, they are underutilized and may not be fully accessible
to all individuals who may benefit from them.
The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) seeks to improve fundamental knowledge
through timely dissemination of scientific discoveries in the area of neurological disease. This mission, across
the translational spectrum, is fully supported by enhancing skills in evidence synthesis, which can prevent waste
in research investment. As knowledge of the brain and nervous system advances rapidly, scientists in this area
have to be highly reflexive to changing current knowledge to ensure that their work is relevant. Training in the
skills of evidence synthesis enables this.
Accordingly, the aim of this proposal is to develop, evaluate, and disseminate a series of educational modules
on rigorous approaches to science focused on evidence synthesis. The proposed modules will cover (1) an
introduction to evidence synthesis, (2) developing a research question and proposal, (3) designing literature
searches, (4) conducting an evidence synthesis, (5) analyzing data from an evidence synthesis, and (6) reporting
results from an evidence synthesis. The modules will be designed to be utilized by different levels of learners
(introductory, intermediate, and advanced) and apply across the translational spectrum (basic science, clinical
science, and public health). Module development, evaluation, and dissemination will occur with an iterative
process of review and feedback across multiple stakeholders (experts and lay persons alike) to create a useful
and comprehensive final product.
The opportunity to improve the use of evidence synthesis techniques through a platform that is accessible to all
interested scientists has significant potential to enhance scientific rigor, and ultimately, improve public health."

hardware and software to conduct research not previously possible; and (2) Guidance (Aims 2-5)–proper use 
of new and existing techniques studies designed to expand our understanding of IDD. Core faculty and staff 
help to conceptualize, plan and implement stimulus paradigms, MRI pulse sequences, and data analysis 
schemes so that our advisees use state-of-the-art and novel imaging technology to best effect, with innovation 
capabilities and support from both NIH and Industry. These services include quality control procedures for 
assuring the best data for these studies. The Core faculty also guide users to seek synergies across different 
types of imaging data (anatomic, functional, spectroscopic, physiologic). We also provide expertise on MRI- 
compatible implementation of transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation 
techniques that can be used complementarily to functional MRI. Importantly, the Neuroimaging Core exists as 
a dedicated research center, and investigators do not compete with clinical services for scan utilization. To 
achieve these overall goals, the overall Core aims are to: (1) to support and promote innovation through the 
use of imaging science; (2) maintain a state-of-the-art scientific, technical and intellectual environment; (3)

10897293,"CORE C. PROTEIN AND SMALL MOLECULE CHEMISTRY
The role of the Protein and Small Molecule Chemistry Core is central to the needs of all the investigators in the
Program Project Proposal. The Core will provide project investigators access to purified proteins and virus-like
particle (VLPs) as well as custom synthesis of small molecules, peptides, and bile acids. The Core will also
construct protein expression plasmids as well as mutant versions of proteins by site-directed mutagenesis as
needed by investigators. Finally, the Core will characterize and quantitate protein-protein and protein-ligand
interactions. Examples of Core activities include purification of norovirus protease to facilitate drug discovery
and purification of VLPs for investigations of antibody interactions with capsid. Activities also include synthesis
of small molecule protease inhibitor candidates for biochemical and cell-based testing as well as structural
studies. Further, the Core will synthesize fluorescently-labeled bile acids for studies of norovirus infections and
propagation. In addition, the Core will measure binding affinity of small molecules with norovirus protease as
well as affinity of antibody-VLP interactions and other protein-protein interactions as needed by project
investigators. The Core personnel have extensive experience in the methods required for providing these
services and all of the equipment and resources necessary are available in the Core. The performance of
services such as protein purification and small molecule synthesis, mutagenesis, and binding measurements in
a Core facility avoids the need for individual investigators to acquire the necessary expertise and equipment
and is an efficient means of facilitating progress on the scientific goals of the project."
10896899,"Veterans with lower limb amputation (LLA), particularly those due to vascular etiology, are at high risk to fall.
Part of this high fall risk could be due to their reported need to focus on each individual step when walking,
which makes adding a concurrent task (e.g., carrying an object) highly demanding. Everyday activities typically
require dual-tasking; therefore, problems with dual-task performance during daily life could account for the high
number of falls for individuals with dysvascular LLA. In the older adult population, dual-task training (i.e.,
practicing two simultaneous tasks) improves simulated dual-task performance. Improving dual-task
performance could reduce fall risk during every day activities (e.g., getting dressed, moving while washing
dishes, talking on the phone, or folding laundry). Veterans with dysvascular LLA need programs to improve
daily activity performance, as they often experience a myriad of comorbidities and medical complexities
impacting participation in everyday life. Before a dual-task training program can be developed, preliminary
relationships to dual-task performance need to be examined in this population. The long-term goal of this line
of research is to implement novel dual-task interventions in the context of functionally relevant and ecologically
valid tasks for Veterans with dysvascular LLA. The initial steps toward the long-term goal are proposed with
this study, in three aims, using an observational cohort and concurrent parallel mixed-methods design: (1)
compare the proportion of participants experiencing mutual interference during dual-task walking between
fall groups (Non-fall vs. Recurrent Fall), (2) identify the relationships dual-task effects have with self-reported
participation in activities of daily living, and (3) qualitatively explore the effects of dual-tasking on self-reported
fall or near-fall dual-task scenarios. The quantitative phase (Aims 1 + 2) will identify how dual-task
performance relates to falls and participation in activities of daily living (n=30 Veterans with dysvascular LLA);
dual-tasking will be measured with basic walking gait and cognitive tasks, as typically measured with other
older adult populations. Dual-task performance will be measured using dual-task effects, a calculation of the
difference in gait and cognitive performance changes between the single and dual-task conditions. Gait speed
(meters/second) will be measured and cognition will be quantified based on serial subtractions (corrected
response ratio considering total responses and mistakes). The qualitative phase (Aim 3) will engage Veterans
with LLA (n=up to 30) to explore underlying cognitive and behavioral mechanisms that contribute to increased
risk for falls. This CDA1 proposal is supported by infrastructure and resources from a parent Merit trial that is
led by the primary mentor. The data gathered from this study will inform the development of a dual-task training
intervention trial (future CDA2 study) for Veterans with dysvascular LLA. During the award period, the
candidate will capitalize on dedicated research time to develop clinical, research, and professional skills
essential for a future role as a VA independent investigator. Specifically the candidate will develop greater
expertise in: research design and analysis (quantitative and qualitative), clinical training for Veterans with
LLA, behavioral interventions, and scientific presentation (written and oral)."
10897264,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It is now widely recognized that the cGAS-STING pathway plays a critical role in determining the efficacy of
radiotherapy. Radiation-induced DNA damage can cause the leakage of nuclear dsDNA fragments into the
cytoplasm, activating the cGAS-STING pathway and inducing type I interferons and antitumor immune response.
However, the radiation-induced antitumor immune response is self-limiting, with many molecular mechanisms
negatively regulating it. Therefore, a better understanding of the suppressive molecular mechanisms is
necessary to enhance the beneficial effects of the radiation-induced antitumor immune response. In this project,
we intend to study the role of PCSK9, a critical cholesterol-regulating factor, for its role in regulating the antitumor
immune response. We base our project on our recently published study that reveals PCSK9’s role in binding and
promoting the degradation of MHC class I on the surface of tumor cells, thereby limiting intratumoral T cell
activation (Liu et al., Nature, 2020, PMC7770056). We also base our project on our unpublished preliminary data
suggesting that inhibiting PCSK9 can significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy of radiotherapy.
We will use genetic approaches to study the roles of PCSK9 in regulating tumor growth and the tumor immune
microenvironment after radiotherapy in both transplanted and genetically induced autochthonous murine tumor
models (Specific Aim 1). We will also use genetic approaches to determine how PCSK9 interacts with the cGAS-
STING signaling pathway in regulating tumor growth and the tumor microenvironment after radiotherapy, with a
particular emphasis on STK11/LKB1-mutant tumors, which are known to have a suppressed cGAS-STING
signaling (Specific Aim 2). Finally, we will also determine if using a clinically approved PCSK9 inhibitor
evolocumab can enhance radiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy of locoregional and
distant tumors. We expect our results will inform future PCSK9 inhibitor-based radiotherapy and immunotherapy
clinical trials upon completing our project."
10897265,"Project Summary/Abstract
Improving patient outcomes will be enhanced by understanding “what works, for whom?” enabling better
matching of patients to available treatments. Despite a wealth of research seeking to optimize CBT outcomes
for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), we have limited understanding about how to match
patients with the appropriate treatment package. Past research has identified patient characteristics that may
influence treatment response, including age, symptom severity, comorbidities, and previous treatment history.
Unfortunately, findings have been inconsistent due to limited sample size, a focus on one modifier at a
time, and difficulty integrating results across trials with different sample characteristics. Between-trial
differences in sample characteristics severely limit conventional meta-analytic tools, greatly complicating
cross-trial comparisons of treatment efficacy. This project will use individual-participant-data from 27 trials and
data from two clinical populations and utilize recent advancements in transportability methods facilitates
understanding “what works, for whom?” Transportability methods include causal analytic approaches to
extend inferences from trial samples to target populations when there are marked differences in the distribution
of sample characteristics between trials and the target population. Robust statistical models are used
to address between-trial differences in covariates, enabling the transportation of causal estimates from trial
samples to target populations. Under explicit causal and statistical assumptions, the transported analyses
provide unbiased estimates of how interventions will fair in the target population(s), enabling apples-to-apples
comparisons of interventions even when two interventions have not been compared in a head-to-head trial. In
addition, the target population can be defined as sub-populations (e.g., younger children with high illness
severity, comorbidities), enabling evaluation of relevant interventions for that sub-population, effectively
providing insight into the question of “what works for whom?”"
10896906,"Rotator cuff (RC) tears are the most common upper extremity injury, with over two million Americans
seeking medical attention annually. With the increased age of our veterans' population, RC tears are
becoming a vital health issue for the VA patients. Secondary muscle degradation following tears,
including atrophy and fatty infiltration (FI) are critical factors that directly determine the clinical
outcome of patients with this injury. Muscle residential fibro/adipogenic progenitor (FAP) cells have
been found to be the major cellular source of fat in RC muscle after massive tendon tears. We recently
discovered that these cells represent a heterogeneous cell population capable of both regenerative and
pathologic responses to muscle injury. Importantly, FAPs can differentiate into a beige adipose tissue
(BAT) phenotype that may have a role in promoting muscle recovery and regeneration in chronic injury
states. However, at this time, no studies have evaluated factors that influence the fate of FAPs in
human cuff tears, nor what FAP regenerative capabilities could be in clinical scenarios such as rotator
cuff repair. Clinically, both patient age and size of the rotator cuff tear have been found to be
independent factors that associate with poorer muscle quality and worse patient outcomes. However,
the interplay between patient and rotator cuff tear size and their influence on muscle stem cell
proliferation, differentiation, and regenerative capabilities is not known at this time. To address this
problem, we will perform the first large-scale clinical study evaluating FAP phenotypic properties in
patients with rotator cuff tears. Expanding on our promising mouse studies that show FAPs are capable
of stimulating muscle regeneration, we will perform a rigorous set of studies that will determine the
regenerative capabilities of human FAPs in this clinically relevant scenario to confirm our hypothesis
that the ability of FAPs to promote healthy muscle regeneration is dependent on the size of the tear and
age of the patient due to changes in FAP gene expression. By the end of this study, we will understand
how clinically important factors (age, tear size) affect the degeneration and regeneration potential of
human FAPs, which should provide critical information on how these endogenous stem cells can be
leveraged to improve precision guided patient outcomes with targeted therapeutic strategies in the near
future."
10896907,"The goal of this training grant program is to prepare outstanding M.D, M.D-Ph.D. and Ph.D. trainees for careers
as scientific leaders in HIV/AIDS research. Despite enormous progress over nearly 4 decades towards reducing
the morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS, substantial challenges remain. These include developing a safe and
effective vaccine; development of a cure for HIV infection; improving the treatment and management of
opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis that burden HIV-infected patients in resource-limited settings;
managing the threat of antiretroviral drug resistance; developing safe and effective interventions to reduce HIV-
associated immune activation that leads to end-organ disease; and developing long-acting antiretroviral drugs
to facilitate life-long adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Progress on these fronts requires basic and translational
research to further our understanding of the molecular biology, pathogenesis, immunology, prevention and
therapeutics of HIV/AIDS. Over the past 30 years this program has trained 128 post-doctoral fellows, the majority
of whom have gone on to leadership positions in academia, industry and government. This program will provide
in-depth laboratory experience in a specific research area of HIV-related virology, immunology, epidemiology,
molecular genetics, molecular therapeutics, genomics and/or systems biology. Criteria for selecting trainees will
include prior training record, aptitude for research and demonstrated commitment to a research career. All
applicants will be selected by a Training Advisory Committee (TAC); 5 trainees will be selected annually.
Particular emphasis will be given to the recruitment of minorities and others underrepresented in AIDS research,
including women, individuals with disabilities and those from disadvantaged backgrounds. Basic elements of
the program include: 1) in-depth research training through laboratory investigation of a specific scientific question
in a particular area of AIDS research under mentorship of a senior investigator; 2) a didactic program consisting
of appropriately chosen courses specific to the trainee’s career goals; 3) frequent exposure to seminars,
workshops and colloquia related to AIDS; regular review of progress by individual Research Advisory
Committees and the TAC. The training facilities consist of state-of-the-art research laboratories at Harvard
Medical School, Harvard-TH Chan School of Public Health, Beth Israel-Deaconess Hospital, Brigham and
Women’s Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Ragon Institute of
MGH, Harvard and MIT. Independently funded senior and junior faculty at each of these institutions constitute
the faculty of this training program, representing diverse AIDS-related disciplines. The faculty collaborate
extensively with one another on AIDS research and will collaborate in directing this training program. The
Harvard Center for AIDS Research and the Harvard Medical School Clinical and Translational Science Center
(Harvard Catalyst) provide additional institutional resources that enrich the scientific experience and career
development of our trainees."
10897270,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Asprosin is a recently discovered, fasting-induced hormone that stimulates hepatic glucose production and
appetite. Plasma asprosin crosses the blood-brain-barrier and directly activates orexigenic AgRP neurons,
resulting in downstream anorexigenic POMC neuron inhibition, in a GABA-dependent manner. This asprosin-
mediated chain of events leads to appetite stimulation and a drive to accumulate adiposity and body weight.
Genetic deficiency of asprosin in humans results in Neonatal Progeroid Syndrome (NPS), characterized by low
appetite and extreme leanness, a result mimicked by mice carrying similar mutations. Obese humans and mice
display pathologically elevated circulating asprosin levels, and depletion of plasma asprosin using monoclonal
antibodies reduces appetite and body weight in such mice, in addition to improving their glycemic profile. Thus,
asprosin, in addition to performing a glucogenic function, is an orexigenic hormone, and anti-asprosin
antibodies show therapeutic potential as anti-obesity agents.
A central question the above observations have led to is – what is the identity of the asprosin cell-surface
receptor? Recently, through unbiased mass spectrometry on the mouse brain we identified a candidate
asprosin receptor (AR) as a putative brain receptor for asprosin. AR is robustly expressed in AgRP neurons but
not expressed in the liver. Conversely, the recently discovered liver receptor for asprosin (OLF734), while
being highly expressed in the liver, is not expressed in AgRP neurons and Olfr734-/- mice do not display
leanness or reduced appetite. Thus, Olfr734 cannot account for asprosin’s stimulatory effect on AgRP neurons
and appetite. Besides confirming AR as a binding partner for asprosin, we present preliminary studies
demonstrating the necessity of AR for asprosin mediated AgRP neuron activation, appetite stimulation and
body weight maintenance. This proposal seeks to build on these preliminary results to determine the
contribution of AR as an asprosin receptor in the brain.
We seek to do so within the following 3 aims: 1) Determine the necessity of AR for asprosin’s orexigenic
effects 2) Validate the AR soluble ligand binding domain for efficacy against metabolic syndrome 3) Determine
the molecular mechanisms by which asprosin neuralization reduces appetite and body weight and interplay
with leptin signaling. At the completion of these aims we expect to definitively validate AR as the brain receptor
for asprosin through an exploration of necessity, druggability, function and in vivo mechanism."

Mohs micrographic surgery (Mohs) is the most effective method to treat nonmelanoma skin cancer. Mohs
achieves high success (98% cure rates) by assessing surgical margins intraoperatively with frozen section
histopathology. Unfortunately, the sophisticated infrastructure and laborious process needed to perform frozen
section histopathology leads to lengthy, expensive surgeries that limit access and result in disparities of care.
We propose to develop ""optical Mohs"" as a rapid, low-infrastructure alternative for Mohs-indicated patients in
rural and other underserved populations who do not currently undergo Mohs surgery. Our optical Mohs
approach will be based on multimodal confocal microscopy (MCM) combined with machine learning to provide
a low infrastructure, automated diagnostic tool requiring minimal tissue processing. MCM combines
reflectance, fluorescence, and Raman confocal microscopy into a single benchtop platform. MCM (using
reflectance and fluorescence) has recently demonstrated success in producing H&E images of unprocessed,
freshly excised skin that pathologist can read with accuracy comparable to frozen section histopathology.
However, this approach alone still requires a pathologist to read the image. Machine learning is being explored
to automate the diagnosis of these images, but has not yet yielded sufficient accuracy. We hypothesize that
the addition of Raman spectroscopy will significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of an automated
approach. Raman is a complementary approach that is sensitive to the skin’s molecular composition and has
been proven in clinical margin detection studies within the skin with sensitivities of 92-100% and specificities of
84-93%; however, a critical barrier to its adoption has been its slow acquisition speed. We introduce two
innovations in Raman acquisition (superpixel and line scanning) that enable acquisition of Raman at speeds
compatible with surgical guidance (speeds of 1cm2/min.). Our preliminary model in thirty patients demonstrates
that a predictive model trained on both structural reflectance confocal images and biochemical information
extracted from Raman images discriminates basal cell carcinoma from normal structures with very high
accuracy, suggesting that optical Mohs could help dermatologists ""keep cutting"" as needed to remove the
entire tumor (100% sensitivity) while not removing an excessive amount of healthy tissue (92% specificity). We
will design, fabricate and bench-test an MCM instrument (Aim 1). We will design a decision-support system for
tumor margin assessment based on MCM images using a post-surgery data set in 108 patients (Aim 2). We
will determine the accuracy of the decision support system for tumor margin assessment based on MCM
imaging in an intraoperative setting in 72 patients (Aim 3). The potential clinical outcome would demonstrate
that an optical Mohs guided surgery could be used where conventional Mohs is indicated but not currently
used, expanding access of Mohs’ accuracy to populations currently not receiving his level of care."

 Diabetes is one of our most costly diseases in both human and economic terms. The Joslin Diabetes
Center T32 Training Program in Diabetes and Metabolism, now entering its 45th year, aims to attract
outstanding young scientists into research on diabetes and metabolism, and train them in a vibrant,
collaborative, supportive, diverse, and inclusive environment in which they are exposed to the many facets of
diabetes and its causes. The Joslin Diabetes Center, founded in 1898, is a collaborative and integrated
organization that fosters cutting-edge research and outstanding diabetes care, and incorporates a strong
research base and a busy clinic in a single facility. Its physical and academic infrastructure is greatly
enhanced by Joslin having been supported as a Diabetes Research Center (DRC) since 1986. The rich
training environment of this T32 Program derives not only from Joslin itself, but also from the many close ties
and collaborations that Joslin has with Harvard Medical School and its affiliated hospitals.
 This T32 Program has trained many outstanding diabetes researchers, including four members of its
current Training Faculty. Our former postdoctoral trainees from the last 15 years include 21 researchers
appointed to the level of Assistant or Associate Professor, mostly at medical schools, and have been awarded
numerous federal grants (including multiple R01 and other federal research awards training awards such as
the K01 and F32 awards). Our pre- and post-doctoral trainees from the last 10 years have published 193
training-associated papers in the highest caliber basic and clinical journals.
 This application aims to build upon this excellence in training. Since 2009 the Joslin T32 program has
been directed by T. Keith Blackwell, MD, PhD, an Associate Research Director at Joslin. Our T32 program is
supported by Executive, External Advisory, and Fellowship Selection Committees. Our Faculty cover a wide
range of interests encompassing Types 1 and 2 diabetes, metabolism, and diabetic complications, and include
basic, clinical, and translational scientists. Joslin-affiliated Adjunct Predoctoral trainers enhance our links with
other Harvard affiliates. This application requests support for the same number of training positions as
currently: five postdoctoral slots and two dedicated pediatric postdoctoral slots, each awarded for two years,
three predoctoral slots awarded for three years each, and eight short-term slots for summer research. As
currently, we will select MD, MD/PhD, and PhD trainees from Joslin research groups and endocrinology
training programs at Harvard-affiliated hospitals, and predoctoral trainees primarily from Harvard PhD
programs. The Program Plan includes many initiatives in trainee education, enrichment, advising, and
recruitment and support of a diverse trainee base. These initiatives are designed to strengthen the training
that we offer, bring top young scientists into diabetes research, and promote collaborations among our
trainees, Joslin research groups, and other Harvard-affiliated diabetes and metabolism researchers."

Percutaneous liver tumor ablation procedures are performed with ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT)
and CT-fluoroscopy guidance. Each image guidance modality has strengths and weakness. US provides
superior tissue contrast and real-time guidance; however, suboptimal or absent acoustic windows, motion
(respiratory, bulk), and poor applicator conspicuity compromise precise tumor targeting and a widening skill
gap limit widespread adoption. The larger field-of-view (FOV) provided by CT is critical for evaluating proximity
of non-target anatomy; however, poor tissue contrast, limited access along the X-Y-Z axis, motion, and non-
real-time guidance limit accurate tumor targeting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior soft
tissue contrast but presents challenges with the comparatively long acquisition times for real-time guidance
and limited access within the scanner bore. Image fusion technologies attempt to harness the strengths of
each modality. Unfortunately, current image fusion technologies are unable to sufficiently account for liver
deformation, bulk respiratory and patient motion which compromise targeting. Further, they do not address
challenges associated with US. An Academic Industrial Partnership is proposed to develop and validate a
solution comprised of two primary elements. The first is a combined platform with a novel MRI compatible
hands-free US and fast 3D deformable image registration for optimized simultaneous US and virtual MR image
guidance in the ablation setting. The second element will be development of advanced MRI methods for real-
time treatment monitoring through MR Thermometry in combination with near-real-time assessment of ablation
zone margins using advanced diffusion and perfusion MRI. This solution will improve primary efficacy and
reduce local recurrence after ablation of liver tumors. This proposal will focus on microwave ablation however
the solution is applicable for a wide variety of thermal therapies."

Trauma is the leading cause of death and disability in young adults in the United States. Traumatic brain Injury
(TBI) contributes to over one third of all these trauma related deaths. In fact, TBI related healthcare expenditures
near 80 billion dollars annually. The impact of TBI is highlighted not only by its high mortality rate, but also the
significant long-term cognitive and psychiatric complications suffered by its survivors. Chronic neuroinflammation
resulting from the constitutive activation of microglia is complicit in this process and represents a complex
interplay between microglia and the gut microbiome via the gut-brain axis. However, the mechanism(s)
underlying gut microbiota-microglia interaction have yet to be elucidated. Published Data from our laboratory
shows a significantly altered gut microbial community after TBI, with increased relative abundance of several
microbial species strongly associated with neurologic disease processes. In the same vein, it is known that
reduced abundance of anaerobic bacteria capable of fermenting dietary fiber into short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)
exacerbate lesion size and neuroinflammation after neurologic injury. Preliminary Data from our laboratory has
shown improved neurocognitive outcomes with dietary supplementation of the SCFAs acetate, butyrate, and
propionate after TBI. Nonetheless, the mechanism(s) linking TBI-induced alterations in the gut microbial
community to the development of subsequent neurocognitive decline have yet to be fully elucidated. W
hypothesize
improve
e
 that targeted microbial and dietary intervention will attenuate microglial activation and
neurocognitive outcomes after TBI. To test this hypothesis,we will determine whether restoring a
pre-injury gut microbial composition via fecal microbiota transplant, targeted microbiota replacement, or dietary
supplementation of SCFAs attenuates the activation of microglia in wild type, germ-free, and genetic targeted
replacement mice. We will use bulk population cell sorting (FACSorting) of microglia followed by single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq). We will compare candidate genes to microbial activity via fecal 16S rRNA gene
amplicon sequencing and fecal metabolite analysis. Harmonized with the transcriptomic and gut microbial
community profiling, all Aims will utilize longitudinal PET/CT imaging of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO)
with a novel fluorine-based radiotracer developed by our group to track and compare the onset, progression,
and degree of microglial activation before, during, and after gut microbial and dietary intervention after TBI.
Collectively, the proposed studies will identify the key role of gut microbial community structure and metabolic
activity in the onset and progression of constitutive microglial activation over the course of TBI, thus raising the
potential for novel therapeutic and biomarker development in TBI patients."

The Neuroscience Graduate, Resilience, Affirmation and Diversity Program at the University of Puerto Rico
(NeuroGRAD@UPR) has the mission to successfully impact, educate, train, and develop a new cadre of
promising underrepresented minority (URM) neuroscience graduate students within our premier Hispanic
Serving Institution (HSI) in collaboration with top-notch neuroscience research institutions. It is important to
clearly state that the NeuroGRAD program’s aspiration is to broaden, improve and facilitate the research
experience/project of its scholars. The NeuroGRAD program will provide the students with resources to be able
to expand his/her research project, be it by additional training in techniques, access to specialized equipment
and other possible challenges that the student might face during his/her doctoral career. After completing the
two years as NeuroGRAD scholars, students will still be eligible to participate in program enrichment activities,
short courses, or brief internships in their collaborator’s laboratories. The NeuroGRAD program will offer an
outstanding opportunity to grow the pipeline of trainees from diverse backgrounds who will succeed in PhD
programs in the Neurosciences. Six doctoral programs in two different campuses of the UPR (Rio Piedras and
Medical School) will be impacted by the proposed research plan. To prepare scholars for the rigors of conducting
neuroscience research, and to ensure successful futures as neuroscientists, during the academic year, each
NeuroGRAD scholar will work under the close supervision of a mentoring team. At least once during the two-
year training, NeuroGRAD scholars will visit a collaborator’s lab to learn a technique and enhance research and
networking skills within our partner institutions. All research mentors are established neuroscientists with
extensive experience in training students at the graduate, and postgraduate level. NeuroGRAD scholars will be
exposed to a broad spectrum of research topics, including basic neuroscience focused on the central nervous
system, and the more translational/applied neuroscience areas. NeuroGRAD scholars will meet bi- monthly with
the PDs and participate in several professional development seminars. During these seminars, scholars will
receive training designed to increase their research competence in scholarly work, public speaking,
grantsmanship, leadership skills and scientific rigor. Depending on the needs of a particular scholars’ cohort, we
will develop specialized workshops. NeuroGRAD program will also support scholars travel for presentations at
annual conferences. Scholars are expected to learn and contribute to the most current research in their field and
have opportunities to network with established scientists. The overreaching goal of the NeuroGRAD program
will be to take advantage on its strategic strengths and foster the necessary competencies to increase the
numbers of URM students in successful and independent career paths. The present proposal is founded on
strategies that significantly promote transformative mentoring, solid experimental rigor, impactful networking
experiences linked to best practices in career leadership growth and identity building."

nurture and develop academic physicians and physician-scientists (MD and MD/PhD trainees) for productive
and sustaining careers as bench or clinical translational investigators, scholarly and institutional leaders in the
broad field of digestive and liver diseases. This Program offers structured opportunities for two trainees per
year (4 trainees total) for mentored training in either laboratory-based scientific discovery (Track 1), or
alternatively in defined areas of clinical translational research, including disease prevention, health
disparities, quality outcomes, public health and epidemiology (Track 2). In this renewal application, we
seek additional support for two predoctoral slots a year, to recruit members of the graduate student and MSTP
community into scientific careers in digestive and liver disease. These overarching goals, reflected in the Rigor
of Prior Research, are realized through intensive and sustained interactions with 28 participating faculty
(14 Track 1; 14 Track 2), individualized programs of research program design, dedicated planning and career
guidance with targets for progressive academic development, supplemented where appropriate by course work
and guided study leading to Masters degrees in Clinical Investigation or Public Health for postdoctoral trainees
and the PhD degree for predoctoral trainees. Our specific aims for the current proposal include: (1). Maintain a
rigorous recruitment and selection process that integrates clinical and research training with career guidance to
sustain a legacy of producing scholarly, research-focused MD and MD/PhD gastroenterologists. (2). Develop an
exceptional pipeline of predoctoral students who will pursue research in digestive and liver research and advance

Despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral medications for HIV suppression, people with HIV who also have
mental health and or substance use disorders suffer disparities in rates of HIV suppression and retention in
HIV care. Evidence based treatment for mental health disorders (MHD) and substance use disorders (SUD),
including use of medications and self-management support have been associated with improved engagement
in HIV care. However, a key gap in many HIV care settings is an inability to consistently screen and provide
treatment for MHD/SUD. Barriers include limited provider knowledge of, and comfort with, MHD/SUD screening
and treatment; time constraints; and absence of support staff to facilitate linkage and retention in MHD/SUD
care. We propose a Hybrid Type 1 implementation- effectiveness trial of an adapted collaborative care
model with peer-specialists as care managers, to enhance screening and treatment for MHD/SUD with
resultant improvement in rates of HIV viral suppression and care engagement in an HIV clinic setting.
Collaborative care (CC), the use of a care manager/team to facilitate and coordinate integration of mental
health and substance use services with primary care, is a well-established evidence-based model. We intend
to adapt CC by training and supporting peer specialist to function as care managers. We will then rigorously
evaluate peer-supported CC as a component of a multidisciplinary team including the HIV care provider and an
addiction psychiatry consultant as an implementation strategy for MHD/SUD screening and treatment in a
continuity HIV care practice. We will compare this peer-supported CC to usual care (UC) referral to psychiatric
care or a SUD treatment program at the discretion of the primary care provider and evaluate the
implementation process using the RE-AIM framework. Our specific aims are as follows
Specific Aim 1: In a randomized trial, compare the proportion of patients with MHD/SUD with HIV
suppression randomized to the collaborative care (CC) and the usual care (UC) referral strategy. We will
randomize 400 patients 1:1 to CC versus UC and compare the proportion of patients with HIV suppression
(defined as HIV RNA <200 copies/ml) at 12 months.
Specific Aim 2: Characterize processes of CC implementation including reach, adoption, fidelity, and
provider acceptability, maintenance over time, and costs associated with the approach. We propose a
mixed methods approach to measure the implementation processes guided by the RE-AIM Framework. In sub
Aim 2b, we will conduct a cost analysis for the peer-supported CC model.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the mediators of the CC intervention on HIV viral load suppression and
retention in care. We will utilize a structured questionnaire and clinical data to assess mediators of the CC
intervention on HIV outcomes and qualitatively assess overall experiences with the peer supported CC model
and explore if patient characteristics impact experience."

 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common genetic disease, affecting ~ 1:500 people, with
substantial clinical burden including heart failure, arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The most commonly
affected protein is myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3). Defining a MYBPC3 variant as pathogenic enables
clinical prognostication and genetic screening in at-risk relatives. Truncating variants of MYBPC3 cause a
premature stop codon resulting in loss of function. However, missense variants in MYBPC3, often classified as
variants of uncertain significance, are difficult to interpret as proteins may tolerate the substitution of one amino
acid for another. Prior cellular and structural data suggest that pathogenic missense variants may lead to HCM
via two distinct mechanisms. Some pathogenic missense variants normally incorporate into myofibrils and Dr.
Thompson hypothesizes that these variants lead to HCM via inhibition of protein binding. To evaluate this
hypothesis, in aim 1, Dr. Thompson will study alterations in protein binding caused by pathogenic missense
variants using affinity mass spectrometry. Further, she will characterize a patient-derived cellular model and a
knock-in mouse model of the most common pathogenic missense variant predicted to work via this
mechanism, R502W, which accounts for 2.4% of HCM cases. These models will evaluate if HCM phenotypes
can be reversed by expression of wild-type MYBPC3, suggesting a similar targeted therapeutic approach can
be utilized for this common missense variant and truncating variants. Other pathogenic missense variants are
rapidly cleared from the cell, similar to truncating variants, and Dr. Thompson hypothesizes that these variants
lead to HCM via thermodynamic instability. Supporting this hypothesis, her prior computational work
demonstrated that patients with HCM and a MYBPC3 VUS computationally predicted to cause subdomain
misfolding exhibited higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes, similar to patients with HCM and known
MYBPC3 pathogenic variant. In aim 2, she will evaluate if a step-wise experimental approach, which
characterizes variants first in a high-throughput manner within individual subdomains and then within
cardiomyocytes using full-length MYBPC3, will enable accelerated identification of variants which cause
protein misfolding. Taken together, this work should provide novel biologic insight into the pathogenic
mechanism(s) of MYBPC3 missense variants, enable improved clinical prognostication for patients with HCM
and at-risk relatives, and inform personalized targeted therapeutic approaches to treat HCM. This proposal is
distinct from Dr. Thompson’s prior experience in chemical biology and will provide her with valuable training in
disease models of cardiomyopathy, cardiac physiology, and advanced experimental genetics. This work, her
mentorship team, and the training activities described will facilitate Dr. Thompson’s development toward her
ultimate goal of becoming an academic physician-scientist and independent investigator."

Natural killer (NK) cells kill tumors and infected cells by integrating signals from two
functional types of receptors, activation and inhibitory. In the mouse, many of these receptors
belong to the Ly49 family, encoded by a cluster of highly related genes, discovered by the
applicant’s laboratory. The highly polymorphic Ly49 receptors are related to killer
immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) on human NK cells as outstanding examples of
convergent evolution. The applicant’s laboratory previously showed that the Ly49H activation
receptor is responsible for genetic resistance of C57BL/6 mice to murine cytomegalovirus
(MCMV) infections. Ly49H recognizes a molecule encoded by MCMV, in a manner
independent of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) alleles. Studies from other
groups suggest that in non-C57BL/6 mice, other Ly49 activation receptors that are not alleles of
Ly49H appear to recognize MCMV-infected cells in vitro but their in vivo significance has not
been established. Ironically, a recent publication from the applicant’s lab also show that Ly49
inhibitory receptors can provide NK cell-mediated protection against MCMV. This process
depends on MHC-I alleles, via Ly49 inhibitory receptor-dependent licensing or education of NK
cells, and their capacity to detect loss of MHC-I expression, termed missing-self, during MCMV
infection. These studies provide the basis for understanding the association of human inhibitory
KIRs and their MHC-I ligands that are also paradoxically associated with protection from viral
infection, indicating that further studies may have clinical significance. But it has been
challenging to study these receptors further in vivo due to the complexities of the Ly49
receptors, including their polymorphism and variegated expression. Here the applicant
presents preliminary data in which expression of all Ly49s have been extinguished and can be
replaced by a single Ly49 expressed on all NK cells. This technological advance will facilitate
the further elucidation of how NK cells control MCMV infection. Thus, the Specific Aims of this
proposal are to: 1) Study non-Ly49H activation receptors in NK cell responses to MCMV. 2)
Characterize NK cells with inhibitory receptors mediating MCMV control. 3) Evaluate
interactions between Ly49 receptors in control of MCMV. Thus, these studies will provide new
insight into the mechanisms by which NK cells control viral infection."
10897771,"The burden of racial and ethnic health disparities is most evident in the southeastern United States, where
Black and Latino populations suffer the highest rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, hypertension,
cancer, and asthma. These chronic conditions are a primary cause of poor health, reduced quality of life, and
premature death, and account for more than 50% of health care expenditures. Despite substantial reduction of
some chronic diseases and risk factors over the last few decades, the Southeast continues to have the highest
number of potentially preventable deaths for each of the five leading causes of death.
 Racial and ethnic minorities comprise 39% of the population of the Southeast (HHS Region IV), which includes
nearly 15 million African Americans and 9 million Latinos. Minorities in the Southeast fare worse on many health
indicators compared to other regions, in large part due to poor socioeconomic status, with more than 22% of
Southeastern residents living in poverty. Effectively addressing pervasive chronic disease disparities will require
interventions that consider the needs, priorities, and lived experiences of those disproportionately impacted.
Research teams with expertise in social, environmental, behavioral, and biological disciplines must collaborate
to develop and test multicomponent strategies aimed at the multilevel determinants that drive disparities.
 The Administrative Core of the Southeast Collaborative for Innovative and Equitable Solutions to
Chronic Disease Disparities builds on existing, highly-productive, health disparities research collaborations
across multiple institutions in the Southeast, where efforts to mitigate chronic disease disparities have been
numerous, yet remain intractable among African Americans and Latinos. The Core will create a cross-institutional
structure, bringing together faculty from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, University of Miami School of
Medicine, and Meharry Medical College to:
Specific Aim 1. To develop and sustain a highly productive and efficient regional transdisciplinary
 collaborative center that enables chronic disease disparities research to reduce disparities among African
 American and Latino populations.
Specific Aim 2. To effectively expedite data integration, coordinate data harmonization, and share data
 across research projects and pilot projects, and with the Coordinating Center.
Specific Aim 3. To facilitate Center operations through real-time data collection for continuous quality
 improvement and support prospective monitoring and evaluation of Center activities."

Innate immune sensors and inflammasomes drive an immune response, primarily providing protection against
microbial infections and mediating control over sterile insults. However, aberrant innate immune signaling is
associated with the pathogenesis of several inflammatory and metabolic diseases, neurodegeneration, and
cancer. In the United States, colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths. Innate
immunity is a major player in the colon, and thus understanding how innate immune pathways contribute to the
various stages of tumor development will be key to improving cancer treatment strategies. We have an extensive
track record of discoveries related to innate immune sensors and their role in colitis-associated colorectal cancer.
We now seek to continue and expand this research program. The primary focus of this application is to unravel
the key mechanisms of novel innate immune sensors and inflammasome regulators discovered in our lab
recently and their crosstalk with cell death regulators in the development of colorectal cancer. Basic science
supporting this area of research is critical to understanding the fundamentals of innate immune responses. This
understanding lays the foundation to explain how defects in these sensing systems lead to the development of
disease in humans. Moreover, as the molecules we are studying are central drug targets, our studies will be
translated into the development of new therapeutics to treat several devastating diseases."

10897232,"Project Summary/Abstract
Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease, affecting 0.3% of children.
Before correction, its four defects lead to increased right heart pressures and mixing of oxygenated and
deoxygenated blood. Even after surgical repair, patients may experience elevated right heart pressures and
volumes due to residual pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary regurgitation, scar formation, and conduction
abnormalities. These changes in geometry, wall thickness, and pressure-volume relationships all contribute to
right ventricular (RV) remodeling, which can eventually lead to adverse events such as ventricular arrhythmias,
RV dysfunction, and the need for pulmonic valve repair, affecting up to 44% of patients overall. Despite the great
advances that have been made in medical and surgical care of ToF patients, there is still limited understanding
of which patients will experience adverse RV remodeling and subsequent clinical events. ToF patients’ cardiac
function is normally assessed annually using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, which provides
excellent views of the right heart and its valves. However, manual analysis of these images is time-consuming
and subject to inter- and intra-user variability. Additionally, CMR provides anatomic and flow data enabling
quantification of pulmonary artery hemodynamics, but has not yet been investigated in post-repair ToF patients.
Detailed characterization of pulmonary artery stresses and pressures, through the application of computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, could provide insight into factors affecting RV remodeling. There remains an
unmet need to comprehensively identify features that characterize and predict progression from primary ToF
repair to adverse RV remodeling and poor outcomes. My objectives in this proposal are to identify the structural
and hemodynamic parameters of ToF that are associated with RV remodeling in order to improve both clinical
care and quality of life. I plan to approach these objectives using two specific aims. In Aim 1, I will develop a
supervised machine learning algorithm to accurately and automatically segment 3D cardiac volumes using CMR
images. This algorithm will enable robust and repeatable measurements of cardiac structure and function for
both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. I hypothesize that this algorithm will achieve accurate and precise
segmentation results as assessed by Dice scores and intraclass correlation coefficients. In Aim 2, I will study
patient-specific pulmonary artery hemodynamics and determine associations with adverse RV remodeling.
Specifically, I will generate 3D and 1D CFD models based upon CMR-derived geometries and phase-contrast
flow data. I hypothesize that hemodynamic parameters such as wall shear stress and total pathway resistance
will be associated with and provide mechanistic insight into RV remodeling. Overall, I anticipate that this project
will provide me with the experience and skills to help achieve my goal of becoming a physician-scientist with
expertise in cardiovascular physiology, medical imaging, and fluid dynamics, while leading to validated
technologies that will support clinicians and researchers in their understanding of ToF."
10915724,"Project Summary:
 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting 70,000-
100,000 Americans. SCD is caused by a mutation in the β-globin gene that leads to significant deformation of
the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and promotes RBC adhesion to other cells, inducing vaso-occlusive
episodes (VOE). Chronic SCD is accompanied by progressive, systemic multi-organ dysfunction and costs over
$475 million annually in hospital admissions.
 Our recent work demonstrates that the depletion of microbiota in SCD mice by antibiotics reduces organ
damage and iron overload. Our preliminary data show that organ damage is significantly improved in germ-free
SCD mice compared to specific-pathogen-free SCD mice, confirming the importance of microbiota in organ
damage development. Analysis by 16S rDNA sequencing uncovered a candidate bacterium—Enterococcus
gallinarum (E. gallinarum)—that may promote organ damage in SCD mice. Additionally, we demonstrate that
SCD mice fed an iron-restricted diet exhibit significant reversal of organ damage compared with SCD mice fed
a control diet.
 In the current application, we propose a 5-year experimental plan to advance our understanding of the
microbiota-mediated effects on SCD disease progression and to test the manipulation of microbiota as a potential
novel SCD treatment. In Specific Aim 1, we will confirm whether E. gallinarum functions as a pathogenic
bacterium to influence the progression of organ damage in SCD mice. Additionally, we will investigate whether
an E. gallinarum–specific vaccine reduces organ damage burden in SCD mice. We will explore the microbiota-
related mechanisms that induce organ damage in SCD mice. Specifically, we will study how microbiota can
bypass the gut barrier by analyzing relevant gut permeability parameters such as tight junction and mucus layer
integrity. We hypothesize that once E. gallinarum translocates from the portal vein to the liver, it upregulates T
helper 17 (Th17) cells that recruit other inflammatory cells to induce the organ damage seen in SCD mice. In
Specific Aim 2, we will explore the role of dietary iron in gut microbiota survival and whether dietary iron is
involved in disrupting gut barrier integrity in SCD mice. These proposed studies, focused on strategies of
microbiota manipulation in SCD, will allow us to identify the key microbial species that contribute to SCD
pathophysiology and potentially provide novel, cost-effective approaches for managing SCD’s life-long
complications."

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) remain a significant threat to human health as over 5 million people in the US
are infected annually, and HPVs account for ~5% of all human cancers. Over 400 subtypes of HPV have been
identified, with 12 classified as high-risk strains accounting for all known HPV-caused cancers. The HPV lifecycle
is intimately coupled to the cell cycle, DNA damage response (DDR) activation, and differentiation status of the
infected cell. Upon infection, HPV induces dsDNA breaks and activates the DDR through members of the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKK): ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia
telangiectasia and Rad-3 related (ATR). ATM and ATR activation are essential for the HPV lifecycle; however, a
third member of the PIKK family, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-pkcs), remains
unstudied. My preliminary studies have shown that in cells harboring HPV episomes, DNA-pk is activated to high
levels. When DNA-pk activity is ablated using small molecule inhibitors, viral episomal levels are significantly
reduced in undifferentiated and differentiated keratinocytes. These data support an important role in DNA-pkcs
activation in the HPV lifecycle. Furthermore, the frequency of dsDNA breaks and R-loop levels increase when
DNA-pk is inhibited. R-loops are trimeric nucleic acid structures consisting of hybridized RNA:DNA strands and
a displaced DNA strand. They form on actively transcribed genes and mediate proper transcription. However,
improper formation or resolution of these structures leads to transcription replication conflicts and DNA breaks.
I have shown that R-loop levels were elevated in high-risk HPVs and tumors and formed on the HPV genome at
high numbers. DNA-pk inhibition caused increased R-loop formation in HPV positive cells, while inhibition of the
other PIKKs, ATR and ATM, did not. The central hypothesis of my project is that DNA-pk activation is necessary
to maintain R-loop homeostasis within HPV positive cells. First, I will study why DNA-pk activation is important
in the HPV lifecycle. I will apply genetic techniques to ablate DNA-pkcs activity and examine how the HPV lifecycle
is affected while also assessing how DNA-pk is activated within HPV positive cells. Second, I will analyze how
DNA-pk mitigates R-loop formation. Through DRIP-seq and RNA-seq, I will identify where R-loops form when
DNA-pk activity is ablated and which R-loop-containing genes have altered transcript levels. R-loop resolving
enzymes will be examined for reduced binding to viral and cellular genome regions and whether DNA-pk
inhibition alters their steady state levels within HPV positive cells. This project will identify key roles facilitated by
DNA-pk in HPV replication while shedding light on important functions of DNA-pk in R-loop functions and cellular
biology."
10895175,"The goal of this proposal is to investigate the mechanisms through which the enzyme IRG1 and its
metabolic product itaconate deplete inflammatory hemophagocytes to prevent severe anemia. Maintaining the
balance between the production and clearance of red blood cells (RBCs) is important for proper oxygenation of
the tissue and prevention of anemia. During inflammation, this balance often goes askew as the clearance of
RBCs by macrophages in a process known as hemophagocytosis in the spleen and liver increases. The
enhanced hemophagocytosis observed during inflammation is mediated primarily by monocytes that have
differentiated into macrophages with markedly enhanced hemophagocytic capacity as opposed to tissue
macrophages. Our collaborators in the Hamerman lab have recently found that Ly6Chi monocytes differentiate
into a unique population of specialized hemophagocytes termed inflammatory hemophagocytes (iHPCs) in
mouse models of severe malarial anemia and lupus like disease driven by transgenic TLR7 overexpression.
During blood stage Plasmodium yoelii-17XNL infection, iHPCs have been shown to contribute to severe
malarial anemia. Currently, the mechanisms that regulate the monocyte to iHPC transition remain unknown.
 The metabolite itaconate, which is produced by the enzyme IRG1, has been shown to alter
inflammatory signaling by activating the anti-inflammatory transcription factor NRF2 and inhibiting succinate
dehydrogenase (SDH) activity to induce metabolic changes that limit the production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Surprisingly, we found that Irg1 is highly upregulated in Plasmodium infected Ly6Chi monocytes and
iHPCs, indicative of metabolic regulation of iHPCs. Preliminary data from our lab generated using mouse
models of both Plasmodium infection and TLR7 stimulation to induce iHPCs have revealed a cell intrinsic role
of Irg1 in depleting iHPCs in the circulation and the spleen. To better understand the mechanism underlying
itaconate mediated depletion of iHPCs, we isolated WT and Irg1-/- Ly6Chi monocytes and observed reduced
cell death in the Irg1-/- monocytes compared to the WT, suggesting that itaconate is inducing death in the
precursor population to regulate the accumulation of iHPCs. Our lab has previously shown that activation of the
RIP kinases, key components of necroptotic signaling, induce Irg1 expression. Furthermore, itaconate has
been shown to itaconylate RIPK3 to enhance necroptosis. Interestingly, knocking out RIPK3 enhanced iHPC
accumulation, implicating the necroptotic pathway as one way in which iHPCs are regulated. Based on our
findings, the goal of this proposal is to elucidate the interactions between IRG1/itaconate and RIPK3 that
promote necroptosis in Ly6Chi monocytes (Aim 1) and to assess how inhibition of necroptosis in vivo alters the
accumulation of iHPCs and anemia severity (Aim 2). With the support and training from this fellowship, I will be
able to continue advancing my knowledge of immunological techniques and work towards my goal of becoming
an independent investigator; so that in the future, I can lead my own group in biotech."

This K23 application proposes a career development plan to help Dr. Emily Kringle establish an independent
research program that focuses on optimizing health among adults with stroke-related disability and other
neurological disabilities. She will train under the mentorship of a transdisciplinary group of senior scientists with
research expertise in behavioral clinical trials, stakeholder-engaged intervention development, qualitative
research methods, and interpersonal theories and methods. She will continue working with her current T32
mentors, Drs. Jun Ma and Megan Lewis, both of whom have extensive experience mentoring trainees. This will
be complemented by content and mentoring expertise from Drs. Bethany Barone Gibbs, Elizabeth Skidmore,
and Dilip Pandey. Collectively, this team will provide an outstanding training environment that will allow Dr.
Kringle to fill critical gaps in her knowledge and skill set relating to the study of lifestyles interventions and
interpersonal social dynamics that influence post-stroke sedentary behavior and quality of life. Her training
goals are to develop skills in (1) design and analyses of conventional and contemporary behavioral clinical
trials, (2) qualitative analyses of stakeholder engagement data, (3) theory, measurement, and analyses of
interpersonal (dyadic) influences on post-stroke health behaviors, and (4) professional skills in interdisciplinary
team science and scientific leadership. Achieving these goals will strengthen her scholarly activities, establish
important collaborations, and acquire critical data that will ensure her successful transition to independence. To
this end, Dr. Kringle’s proposed research plan that builds directly on her prior work developing the Activating
Behavior for Lasting Engagement (ABLE) intervention. ABLE uses behavioral activation to reduce post-stroke
sedentary behavior. Reducing sedentary behavior is particularly important for promoting health in the context
of stroke-related disability. Even if impairments (motor, cognitive, sensory) fully resolve, stroke survivors do not
automatically re-engage in non-sedentary activities as impairments diminish. Further, residual impairments,
social influences (protective care providers), and environmental factors (transportation, accessibility) create
barriers to engagement in personally meaningful non-sedentary daily activities. The purpose of this proposal is
to adapt ABLE to telehealth (teleABLE), targeting the first year post-stroke, and evaluate its acceptability,
fidelity, and potential effects in a pilot randomized clinical trial. We will also explore factors that are potential
moderators or theoretically driven mediators of intervention outcomes. Embedded within this trial is data
collection from stroke survivors’ social support person to explore interpersonal (dyadic) influences on post-
stroke sedentary behavior. Findings from this study, in combination with the career development plan, will
enable Dr. Kringle to launch an independent program of research that aims to 1) develop interventions that
reduce post-stroke sedentary behavior to enhance health and quality of life, and 2) elucidate the role of
interpersonal social dynamics in health behaviors and quality of life among adults with stroke-related disability."

Rapid escalations in substance use during adolescence confer risk for the development of substance and
alcohol use disorders across the lifespan. Thus, identifying malleable risk factors and prevention targets that
emerge before substance use onset is an important public health goal. Research demonstrates that delay
discounting (DD), the tendency to perceive diminishing value in a reward as a function of the length of delay in
its receipt, is an important and modifiable risk factor for substance misuse. However, the early developmental
precursors of DD, including environmental adversity and genetic risk factors that are thought to be associated
with increases in DD across adolescence are not well understood. The extant literature examining these
vulnerabilities is limited by its reliance on poorly characterized markers of environmental adversity, lack of
consideration of developmental effects, and the genetic contributions to the development of DD. The current
application proposes to address these limitations utilizing data from the Adolescent Brian Cognitive
Development (ABCD) Study, a national sample of youth (n = 11,875) with planned longitudinal assessments
from age 9 to 17, spanning critical developmental periods for changes in DD and substance use. The
proposed project will leverage rich and varied indicators of adverse childhood events and community
environments (using the “Pair of ACEs” framework) and genetic data to create polygenic risk scores for DD
(informed by findings from the largest available genome-wide association study of DD performed by project
consultants). The project timeline will take advantage of both currently available and planned releases of data
to test study aims and accelerate dissemination of findings from this landmark study. Specific aims of the
study include: (Aim 1) to examine the structure of ACEs and its relation to early levels of DD; (Aim 2) to
characterize the impact of ACEs on measured trajectories of DD over time; and (Aim 3) to investigate the
joint associations between genetic and ACEs risk factors on changes in DD across adolescence. We also
propose to explore whether developmental trajectories of DD mediate the relation between genetic and ACEs
factors and subsequent changes in substance use frequency and severity. The research team brings together
expertise in child development, delay discounting, genetics, and environmental indicators of risk, allowing for
the most comprehensive study of the independent and joint contextual and genetic contributions to DD
development. Findings from this project will provide mechanistic insights into the development of DD, in
addition to specific and actionable advancements at the environmental level that may inform targeting of
prevention approaches for reducing substance use among at-risk youth."

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the only abdominal organ that has evolved with its own enteric nervous system
(ENS) fully contained within the gut wall, also known as the “second brain” in the gut. Our long-term goal is to
understand how the intrinsic primary sensory neurons (IPANs) in the ENS detect and respond to both physical
and chemical cues in the gut lumen and control propulsion of content in the colon.
Although known for about 25 years, the IPANs are still a subset of the most mysterious neurons in the ENS
because how they participate in coordinated muscle movements (motility), regulate immune cell function
(immunity) and maintain integrity of intestinal barrier is not completely understood. Equally as mysterious is
whether the IPANs can fulfil the function as a “pattern generator” and can control the rhythmicity of cyclical
propagating contractions along the colon. This is largely due to a lack of tools that can be used to selectively
manipulate the excitability of specific classes of enteric neurons and any drugs that have been tried to
stimulate or block activity in IPANs will likely act on many other types of neurons (or non-neuronal cells),
making interpretation of the results unclear.
In pilot studies, we have generated critical resources enabling us to identify and selectively targeting the β-
CGRP-expressing (β-CGRP+) IPANs. By using these unique resources, we will be able to ask important
questions regarding the roles of the β-CGRP+ IPANs in the ENS: What role the β-CGRP+ IPANs have in the
propagation of neural activity along the gut? Are these IPANs activated by both mechanical and chemical cues
in the gut lumen? Can these IPANs serve as cellular sensors for distinct microbiota-derived metabolites?
This proposal represents a major technical advance by using cutting-edge neurogenetic approaches which
make it possible to genetically target and determine the functionality of the β-CGRP+ IPANs in the ENS both
ex vivo and in vivo, providing the first insights into how selective activation and inhibition of the β-CGRP+
IPANs in the ENS affects GI-motility. This information will advance our understanding of the inner workings of
the ENS and shed new insights on the development of novel strategies for the treatment of motility-related GI
disorders by targeting the IPANs in the ENS."

 Impaired brain energy metabolism is increasingly recognized as an important target mechanism for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) prevention and treatment. Increasing evidence suggests that manipulating brain
energy substrates improves brain health in aging and may be therapeutic in AD through a metabolic shift of the
brain. Particularly, the ketogenic diet (KD) shows substantial effects on improving clinical outcomes, including
cognitive function, in AD patients, by shifting the major brain energy substrate from glucose to ketones.
However, the underlying mechanisms for such approaches are not well understood mainly due to a lack of
non-invasive methods to directly assess brain bioenergetics in humans, limiting further progress in developing
effective intervention strategies for AD. Thus, we designed a randomized clinical trial to overcome current
limitations through the development of advanced 1H and 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)
techniques to measure neuroenergetic biomarkers with 3T clinical scanners and to use the developed
techniques to test our hypothesis that the KD significantly enhances brain energy metabolism in aging and AD.
 During the R61 developmental phase, we will develop techniques to measure 1) primary circulating ketone
produced in response to a KD, b-hydroxybutyrate (BHB); 2) bioenergetic co-enzymes involved in both cytosolic
and mitochondrial metabolism, NAD, NAD+, NADH; 3) the primary energy-carrying molecules, adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) in AD-relevant brain regions.
 During the R33 Basic Experiment Study involving Humans (BESH) trial, we will investigate the physiological
effects of the KD on brain energy metabolism in aging and AD by measuring the 1H/31P MRS neuroenergetic
biomarkers that we develop during the R61 phase. Both AD patients and older adults with normal cognition will
be randomized to either the 4-week, experimentally-controlled feeding of the KD or therapeutic lifestyles
changes (TLC) diet. In Aim 1, we will quantify the degree of brain energetic manipulation via the KD in aging
and AD using neuroenergetic imaging. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the association between brain energetic
manipulation and brain antioxidant status in aging and AD using antioxidant (GSH) imaging. In Aim 3, we will
determine the effect of aging and AD on neuroenergetic status by utilizing baseline data from participants in
both R61 and R33 phases (30 healthy adults, 30 older adults with normal cognition, 30 AD patients).
 We anticipate that this project will provide proof-of-concept that the KD truly manipulates and enhances
neuroenergetics in aging and AD for the first time by directly assessing this widely hypothesized mechanism
with in vivo neuroimaging biomarkers in humans. The infrastructure established through the R61 phase will
provide a critical platform for AD intervention trials that can be extended across the NIA’s network of
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRC) for use in future multicenter clinical trials."

St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH) is home to the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer
Center dedicated solely to pediatrics, giving our institution a unique role in advancing the nation’s efforts to
combat cancer. Developing the next generation of clinician scientists focused on cancer in children and
adolescents is critically important. SJCRH provides an exceptional environment for advanced training in patient-
oriented oncology research. Clinical investigation is at the center of our mission. Our founding director, Dr. Don
Pinkel, received the Lasker Award for demonstrating the power of combination chemotherapy. Today, world-
class basic and translational research is integrated with a robust clinical and clinical research enterprise. For our
patients with newly diagnosed cancer, 47% are enrolled in therapeutic trials within 15 days of diagnosis; 83% of
all enrollments are to St Jude investigator-initiated trials; 38% of interventional trials for children with cancer are
investigator-initiated and institutionally sponsored. Trainees in our hematology/oncology fellowship program
have independent research projects, high-impact publications, and grants. However, the transition to faculty
positions and loss of protected time for patient-oriented research are challenging. The Pediatric
Oncology Career Development Program at St. Jude (POCDP) proposes to bridge this gap by leveraging the
exceptional resources and training environment offered at SJCRH to provide protected time for mentored
research for two scholars (instructor-level faculty). Scholars will be mentored by a Scholarly Oversight Committee
(SOC) that will be tailored to their research interests. Each SOC will include a clinical researcher, an
epidemiologist, basic or translational scientist, a biostatistician, and an external mentor. Didactic and experiential
training will focus on three areas: (1) Translational Science and Medicine, (2) Clinical Trials Research and
Management, and (3) Professional Development. Advanced academic training includes the opportunity to obtain
a master's degree in clinical investigation. Scholars will engage in the clinical trial review process, trial design
lecture series, clinical research tutorials, and leadership development sessions. Each scholar is expected to:
design a clinical trial; present their research; and submit a career development grant. The “Visiting Scholar
Exchange Program,” will provide the opportunity for scholars to gain exposure by being an invited speaker at a
partner Cancer Center. Scholars’ progress will be monitored by their SOC and an Internal Steering Committee;
program effectiveness will be evaluated by scholar research productivity (publications, grants, clinical trials),
feedback from the scholars and the SOC, and evaluations by an External Advisory Board. At SJCRH, advanced
genomics and translational science, innovative investigator-initiated clinical trials, and the seminal discoveries of
the late effects of treatment by our Cancer Control and Survivorship Program provide an environment of
exceptional clinical care and opportunities for training and development of leaders and innovators in patient-
oriented research for children with cancer."
10869988,"Neurons have the remarkable ability to process and respond to complex stimuli such as physical exercise and
changes in an organism’s external environment. The value of exercise for brain health cannot be
underestimated as its effects impact mood, learning and memory as well as prevention and rehabilitation and
recovery from neurological illness. However, experimental effort largely has been focused on the effects of
sustained exercise over periods of weeks or months (1-3), which can involve direct effects on the CNS as well
as indirect effects through alterations in multiple organ systems. Likewise, most attention in exercise-induced
hippocampal plasticity has been directed at newborn granule cells (1, 3-7), but plasticity occurs in the far more
numerous mature granule cells as well (8). Aside from its sustained benefits, acute exercise has also been
linked to short term increases in learning and memory (9, 10) that are likely mediated by the hippocampus (11-13). How this occurs at the molecular level is not clear. Thus we decided to examine how a single episode of
exercise affects neural activity and impacts brain function. We developed a novel approach for in vivo analysis
of dentate granule cells activated by a single episode of voluntary exercise. Our approach, akin to an ""impulse""
function in engineering terms, allowed us to examine exercise-induced synaptic and molecular changes over a
period of days post-exercise. Mature dentate granule cells, activated by voluntary exercise during a two-hour
window, were permanently marked using Fos-TRAP mice (14, 15), in which the immediate early gene
promoter linked to a fluorescent reporter, permanently marks activated granule cells. The single episode of
exercise resulted in selective increases in synaptic function and dendritic spine density in the outer molecular
layer of the dentate gyrus, the lamina receiving contextual information from entorhinal cortex. The top
upregulated gene in RNAseq of exercised-activated cells was Mtss1L, a previously understudied gene coding
for an I-BAR-domain protein. As BAR domains sense and induce membrane curvature, we hypothesize
that Mtss1L is an early effector of dendritic spine and synapse formation following stimuli such as
exercise. Our preliminary data lead to a number of interesting questions that will be addressed in this
proposal. Namely: 1. Where is Mtss1L localized and why are the effects on synapses limited to a specific

10870092,"Summary/Abstract
Although vaccination is the most effective measure for influenza prevention, there is considerable
variation in the responses to influenza vaccines that is influenced by factors such as age, sex,
and obesity level. Major advances in predicting and analyzing the cellular and molecular basis of
vaccine responses are being made possible by the application of high-dimensional experimental
and computational approaches that comprise Systems Vaccinology. This framework is yielding
predictive molecular signatures for influenza vaccine immunogenicity and protection. However,
there remains a considerable knowledge gap in delineation of cellular and molecular pathways
that affect the responses to advanced-generation influenza vaccines in older or obese individuals.
To gain new insights into the cellular and molecular states that underlie variation of influenza
vaccine responses in older, healthy weight or obese individuals we propose to perform deep
molecular and genomic profiling of immune cell states after screening for extreme responders.
Our approach, focused on extremes of individual vaccine responses, draws upon successful prior
use of such a framework in analyzing genetic basis of extreme phenotypic variability. We propose
in Aim 1 to elucidate latent factors and B cell genomic states underlying weak or robust
immunogenicity of the advanced-generation seasonal influenza vaccine within healthy weight
older individuals using deep molecular profiling and interpretable machine learning as well as
computational genomics. Aim 2 will delineate latent factors and infer molecular mechanisms by
which obesity distinctively affects influenza vaccine immunogenicity based on high-dimensional
and multi-scale profiling of the immune responses as in Aim 1. Uncovering new molecular markers
and pathways will spur tailored vaccine design that addresses specific impairments in vulnerable
individuals. Our team brings together strong expertise in three complementary and essential
disciplines that comprise vaccinology, immunology and systems biology."
10891384,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to
detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT)
to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized
anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be
based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address
the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National
Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination
to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators
in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS)
initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college
students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries.
Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking
treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for
student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the
list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other
50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after
randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine
learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a
precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then
implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the
PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS
internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate
unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in
treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if
access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek
treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the
precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for
dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health
policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working
relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts."

10891433,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One major challenge facing the field of Communication Sciences and Disorders (CSD) is its demographic
homogeneity. This disparity is problematic both in clinical practice and in research. For researchers who are
members of underrepresented minority groups (e.g., racial or ethnic minorities, individuals with a disability,
individuals who are economically disadvantaged), the CSD-specific demographics are compounded with the
challenges of being a minority in higher education, further isolating these individuals and raising barriers to
success in the field. Having a diverse workforce is critical for a number of reasons, including ameliorating
health disparities in research and treatment.
The proposed research education program—Summer Health Academic Research Experience in
Communication Sciences and Disorders (SHARE-CSD)—is a 6-week summer research experience for
undergraduate students from backgrounds typically underrepresented in STEM and health fields. Program
participants will engage in activities in three main areas: (i) research (depth and breadth components), (ii)
academic and career preparation, and (iii) extensive mentoring from peers and faculty resulting in a robust
social network. Social networks play an important role in the academic achievement of minoritized students,
and in particular, networks that include other minoritized students can increase students’ sense of belonging.
Taken together, these activities are expected to increase program participants’ academic and skills
preparedness for research and clinical careers, and to support the diversity of the CSD pipeline. The program
will undergo rigorous evaluation to assess its efficacy for program participants both short- and long-term."

10891454,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dysregulation of transactivating response region DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) has been linked to many
neurodegenerative diseases, including frontotemporal dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). TDP-43 has a variety of functions linked to its RNA-binding motif, including regulation of
transcription, splicing, and RNA transport. Along with these effects, TDP-43 alters expression of interferon (IFN)-
related and other immune genes essential for antiviral responses. The relationship between viral pathogens and
TDP-43 is bidirectional, as exposure to poly(I:C), which simulates viral pathogens, can promote subcellular
mislocalization of TDP-43. Viral pathogens, like TDP-43 dysregulation, are linked to AD and other dementias;
AD has been associated with increased presence of viral pathogens, like herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and
altered IFN-related signaling and neuroimmune cascades. Our laboratory found that, like neuronal TDP-43,
astrocytic TDP-43 can be mislocalized to the cytoplasm in AD. Dysregulation of astrocytic TDP-43 in mouse
models caused neural deficits and cell-autonomous changes in antiviral and IFN-inducible factors. Further,
dysregulated TDP-43 increased astrocytic susceptibility to HSV-1. Astrocytic susceptibility to HSV-1 associated
with overexpression of human TDP-43 was reduced by blocking the ability of human TDP-43 to bind RNA.
Previous studies also show that the RNA-binding domain on TDP-43 is necessary for its other disease-linked
effects. Based on this evidence, I will test the hypothesis that dementia-related TDP-43 dysfunction affects
antiviral pathways and increases neural susceptibility to HSV-1 by altering TDP-43 binding to host RNA, resulting
in aberrant host antiviral and immune gene expression and impaired innate antiviral signaling. I propose to use
a variety of cellular and molecular techniques to examine in vitro (Aim 1.1) and in vivo (Aim 1.2) susceptibility to
HSV-1 following cell-specific expression of TDP-43 variants that either maintain nuclear localization, mislocalize
to the cytoplasm, cannot bind to RNA, or both. I will also determine cell-specific molecular mechanisms that
promote differences in antiviral pathways via single-cell RNA sequencing (Aim 2.1), and conduct targeted
analysis of alternative splicing (ScISOr-Seq), transposable element expression (TEtranscripts), and protein
levels (Western blotting). Finally, I will examine the physiological functions of differential genes of interest
identified in Aim 2.1 using genetic and pharmacological approaches. Uncovering the mechanistic links that
connect TDP-43 dysregulation to antiviral pathways and viral susceptibility may define new pathobiological
mechanisms and therapeutic targets to prevent neurodegenerative disease onset and progression."

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved gene therapies for several rare inherited diseases and
blood cancers, and hundreds of clinical trials are in progress testing the safety and effectiveness of gene
therapies for rare and ultra-rare disorders, various cancers, and complex neurological diseases. For patients
with rare and serious or debilitating disorders for whom existing treatment options are limited or do not work,
the approved gene therapies and the promise of others are encouraging signs that new treatment options are
emerging. Yet the translational gene therapy ecosystem faces several interrelated challenges: 1) obtaining
sufficient evidence of safety/effectiveness from clinical trials to justify FDA approval; 2) establishing cost and
payer coverage policies so patients have access to affordable treatments; and 3) generating sufficient safety
and effectiveness evidence of approved gene therapies when used in the clinical setting. The proposed project
will investigate how gene therapy challenges and associated ethical and policy issues that exist within the
translational gene therapy ecosystem are characterized and being addressed. We will 1) analyze documents
from federal and state policymakers (the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, relevant state
Medicaid agencies, the U.S. Congress) and organizations that play a role in agenda setting and influencing
public policy regarding the translational gene therapy ecosystem; 2) conduct a survey with physicians from four
therapeutic domains (hematology, infectious disease, neurology, oncology); 3) conduct in-depth interviews with
experts from five domains (translational gene therapy research and development; the FDA drug-approval/post-
marketing process; health policy/payer coverage; patient advocacy; bioethics/ELSI of genetics and genomics);
and 4) develop a) issue/policy briefs, b) recommendations for addressing gene therapy challenges and
associated ethical and policy issues, and c) recommendations for future normative and empirical analysis of
gene therapy challenges and associated ethical and policy issues. Innovative features of the proposed project
include being framed by the premise that gene therapy challenges are interrelated and co-exist within a
complex translational science ecosystem; examining how physicians, various experts, and policymakers are
grappling with gene therapy challenges; and applying a normative framework that draws on ideas and
concepts from bioethics and political science. The proposed project will synthesize the findings from the
document/policy analysis, survey, in-depth interviews, and normative analysis of gene therapy challenges and
associated ethical and policy issues to develop recommendations and issue/policy briefs that will 1) help
stakeholders in the translational gene therapy ecosystem in their deliberations and decision-making about
addressing gene therapy challenges and associated ethical and policy issues, and 2) identify ethical and policy
issues within the translational gene therapy ecosystem that warrant additional normative and empirical
investigation by various stakeholders."
10889595,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite its centrality in anxiety- and trauma-related disorders, the avoidance of danger in the environment
requires new paradigms. Using the RDoC framework, the mental health field has sought to define circuit-
behavior relationships that may underlie psychiatric disorders. A central challenge in this process has been the
difficulty in identify clear links between threat computation and neural circuits. A further threat has been that
even when such links are apparent, as in predator avoidance, the translatability of these behavioral models
across species has been limited. Threat computation plays a central role in the genesis of anxiety- and trauma-
related disorders, yet we do not have a clear behavioral paradigm that enables us to precisely control the
perception of survival danger in the same way in mice and humans.
Here, we propose to develop a novel quantitative circuit neuroscience platform for studying the fear of heights.
Exposure to high places induces common patterns of peripheral arousal, avoidance, and distress across
species yet has been limited in its study in mice. Since physical height is experience through the visual system,
it can be precisely manipulated to induce artificial changes in threat perception that can influence behavior.
Most importantly, the exposure to heights is a stimulus which induces a threat of death across species. Thus,
we propose to establish a controllable model of aversion to visual heights as a new paradigm in the
translational circuit neuroscience of anxiety.
In order to do so, we will combine chemogenetics, fiber photometry, computational modeling of behavior, and a
virtual reality system to demonstrate the role of norepinephrine circuits in the fear of heights. This
comprehensive program is based on substantial preliminary data demonstrating that norepinephrine neurons in
the locus coeruleus are activated by elevation. Furthermore, we will demonstrate the potential of the visual fear
of heights paradigm by manipulating the perceived distance from the ground in real time, thus enabling
unprecedented insights into the online computation of threat that is not possible with other fear-related
paradigms. Once established, this behavioral model will facilitate inference into circuit mechanisms of innate
threat that can for the first time be compared in both mice and humans."
10869783,"Title: CRISPRa-based rescue of sensorimotor deficits in the Scn2a+/- mouse model of autism
spectrum disorder
Project Summary: Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the sodium channel gene SCN2A
are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorder. SCN2A encodes the neuronal sodium
channel NaV1.2, which contributes to membrane excitability in somatodendritic or axonal
compartments, depending on cell class. Heterozygous loss of Scn2a, modeled in Scn2a+/- mice,
causes deficits in cellular excitability and synaptic function across multiple brain areas, and drives
robust systems- and behavioral-level deficits in sensory processing, neural coding, and
sensorimotor learning. Here, our goal is to rescue these cellular, circuit and behavioral deficits
using CRISPR-activation (CRISPRa)-based therapeutic approaches in Scn2a+/- mice.
 Most autism risk genes, like SCN2A, are associated with autism by heterozygous loss-of-
function. CRISPRa is a promising therapeutic approach for many genetic forms of autism
because it upregulates expression of the remaining functional gene copy, potentially rescuing
cellular function. Scn2a+/- mice are an ideal test case for CRISPRa intervention in severe genetic
forms of autism.
 We have developed CRISPRa-based reagents that restore Scn2a expression to near-
normal levels, and preliminary data show that treatment of adolescent Scn2a+/- mice with
CRISPRa successfully rescues cellular and synaptic phenotypes in at least one brain area. Here,
we will test the effectiveness of CRISPRa rescue of cellular, circuit, and behavioral phenotypes
across sensory, associative, and motor regions of the brain. To do so, we bring together three
laboratories with proven expertise in Scn2a disorders and autism, cellular and systems
physiology, and therapeutics. Results of this study will help establish the feasibility of gene
therapy for neurodevelopmental disorders including severe genetic forms of autism, and will help
define the critical developmental windows in which therapeutic interventions are most effective."

10872213,"Summary
Among women, breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy, and the second leading cause of cancer
death. Patients with basal/triple negative BC (TNBC) have the poorest clinical outcome with no targeted
therapies available when compared to other molecular subtypes. Fas/CD95 is a well characterized death
receptor that in permissive cells mediates induction of apoptosis when stimulated by its cognate ligand, FasL. It
is now well established that Fas also has multiple nonapoptotic, tumor promoting functions. High Fas
expression is a negative prognostic factor for TNBC. We have previously demonstrated in multiple genetically
engineered mouse tumor models with tissue specific deletion of Fas that cancer cells maintain Fas expression
and without Fas tumors do not grow. However, some tumors still formed in these knock-out (KO) mice due to
‘escapers’ from Cre recombination. It remained unclear whether this activity of Fas was cell autonomous or
required cells of the tumor microenvironment. New preliminary data on a mouse model of TNBC now suggest
that tumor cell expressed Fas exerts an immune suppressive activity promoting recruitment of myeloid derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) resulting in inhibition of tumor infiltration by natural killer (NK) cells. Most recently
we discovered, KPC2, a novel Fas interaction partner that binds to the C-terminal end and in unstimulated
TNBC cells sequesters both the NF-κB subunit p65 and KPC1, a ubiquitin ligase that degrades the p50
precursor p105. We found that when Fas is eliminated p105 gets degraded shifting the balance of NF-κB
subunits from repressive p50/p50 homodimers to transcriptionally active p50/p65 heterodimers. That in turn
unleashes production of a number of proinflammatory cytokines that regulate the recruitment of a number of
immune cells including NK cells. Based on these preliminary data we hypothesize that in TNBC Fas acts as a
novel immune check point for NK cells likely by remodeling the immune landscape, that a novel Fas bound
protein complex around KPC2 is responsible for this immune suppressive activity of Fas and finally, that
disrupting this interaction unleashes an antitumor activity that can be used to target TNBC cells. These
hypotheses will be studied in two specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Characterize immune suppressive activities of
Fas in triple negative breast cancer. Specific Aim 2: To determine how Fas expression suppresses a
proinflammatory program. The goal of this project is to characterize novel activities of Fas in promoting TNBC
growth and metastasis as well as its immune suppressive function on NK cells. The project will increase our
knowledge on the role of a complex and critical receptor/ligand signaling pair in cancer that has long been
misunderstood. Only recently has inhibition of FasL (and not its use) been recognized as a valuable option for
the treatment of cancer in the clinic. In TNBC our work now points at inhibiting the Fas receptor in addition to
its ligand. Finally, the novel immune suppressive activity of Fas provides a compelling rationale to combine
Fas/FasL inhibition with conventional checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of TNBC."
10872217,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Ice hockey is a collision/contact sport with a high rate of injury. Body checking, where an athlete intentionally
collides with an opponent to gain possession of the puck is a critical component of play in boys’ and men’s
hockey. Although body checking is not allowed in women’s and girls’ hockey, it is still considered a contact sport;
male and female hockey athletes share comparable rates of concussion. Recent evidence suggests that
exposure to subconcussive head impacts, even in the absence of clinically-diagnosed concussion is sufficient to
cause alterations in brain microstructure and cognitive function. Assessments of postural control have been used
to aid diagnosis of concussion, and evidence suggest that such assessments are sensitive enough to detect
subclinical injury. To date, no studies have evaluated individual-level performance (athlete skill) as a determinant
of head impact exposure. Future interventions could target skill development in an effort to improve sport safety,
particularly at the youth level. However, accurate quantification of head impact exposure and the relationship it
shares with individual performance metrics and clinical postural control deficits is necessary before interventions
can be implemented. The objective of this study is to use a mouthpiece-sensor for measurement of head impact
exposure in male and female youth hockey athletes and evaluate the relationships between cumulative
exposure, individual performance metrics, and postural control deficits. The study team identified in this proposal
has extensive history in quantifying head impact exposure in youth sports and in evaluating clinical outcomes. A
well-developed research and mentorship plan has been prepared for the successful completion of the following
aims. In Aim 1, 32 boys’ and 32 girls’ youth hockey athletes will complete a pre- and post-season assessment
of ice hockey performance. Youth athletes will be instrumented with a custom mouthpiece sensor to wear during
the season. All on-ice sessions will be recorded and reviewed to identify characteristics of head impacts. We will
quantify impact frequency and magnitude for each impact. In Aim 2, instrumented youth athletes will undergo a
pre- and post-season postural control assessment. Changes in postural control measures from pre- to post-
season will be evaluated for correlation with on-ice head impact exposure and youth athlete performance metrics.
Successful completion of this research will elucidate previously undescribed relationships between head impact
exposure, youth athlete performance metrics, and postural control deficits. Future intervention studies can utilize
this research to design strategies aimed at improving youth athlete performance to reduce exposure, which in
turn may decrease postural control deficits. This research could ultimately serve as an early advancement
towards policy change that will improve youth hockey safety and mitigate risk of brain injury or functional
impairment."
10872221,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted antibiotic resistance as one of the greatest medical
challenges of the 21st century. Without new antibiotics, it is predicted that antibiotic resistant infections will cause
10 million annual deaths worldwide by the year 2050 (surpassing cancer). These infections are poised to negate
many advances of modern medicine that rely on antibiotics. Thus, choosing effective antibiotics based on
bacterial susceptibilities would provide the greatest therapeutic benefit.
One form of resistance that is overwhelmingly undetected is heteroresistance, in which a minor subpopulation
of bacterial cells is phenotypically resistant. These resistant cells rapidly expand in the presence of an antibiotic
and thus can cause treatment failure. As heteroresistance is common (>25% of antibiotic-bacteria combinations),
detecting heteroresistance is critical to address the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. Indeed, it was recently
demonstrated that knowledge of heteroresistance can be used to guide successful combination therapy, and
can thus even treat pan-resistant bacteria.
Unfortunately, clinical susceptibility tests lack the resolution to identify heteroresistance, and the laboratory test
for heteroresistance is time consuming and slow. Further, the next-generation susceptibility tests currently under
development are largely focused on rapid diagnostics performed on a small number of cells, making detection
of rare cells impossible. Developing a new susceptibility test is further complicated by the requirements of the
clinical microbiology laboratory; to be adopted, a susceptibility test must require minimal manual labor, work
robustly, and be inexpensive – properties that are often at odds with high sensitivity. Based on these issues,
there is broad agreement that a new technological approach is required.
Here the development of a new, more sensitive susceptibility test using interferometry to measure bacterial
population topography is proposed. The use of interferometry to measure topography has no precedence in
antibiotic susceptibility testing, and little precedence in biomedical research. However, its commonly used in
physical sciences as it is rapid, inexpensive, robust, doesn’t require dyes or stains, and provides super-resolution
measurements of topography. Preliminary results demonstrate that interferometry has the resolving power to
rapidly detect heteroresistance and distinguish it from susceptibility. Our interferometry-based approach is a
substantial improvement over clinical susceptibility tests that cannot detect heteroresistance, research laboratory
tests that can detect heteroresistance but are too slow for clinical application, and traditional topographic imaging
approaches, e.g. confocal microscopy, that are expensive and lack the resolving power to distinguish
heteroresistance from susceptibility. Building off our promising preliminary results, this proposal will determine
the underlying biophysics relating bacterial topography to death and reproduction. This work is pivotal to reliably
convert topography into susceptibility profiles across a broad range of clinically relevant bacteria and antibiotics."

Maternal undernutrition affects 50% of the world’s female population. Maternal weight before pregnancy is a
strong predictor of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), low birth weight, and future childhood stunting. While
humanitarian efforts to improve nutritional status have focused primarily on children; there is little
understanding of mechanisms underlying maternal undernutrition and its transmission to children.
Our lab has identified perturbations in postnatal gut microbiota development that are evident in feces and the
small intestine (SI). Our gnotobiotic mouse models have provided preclinical evidence that the SI microbiota of
Bangladeshi children with stunting is causally related to the pathogenesis of a poorly understood enteropathy
[environmental enteric dysfunction (EED)] characterized by loss of SI villi, reduction in intestinal absorptive
area, epithelial barrier dysfunction and associated intestinal and systemic inflammation. The goal my project is
to determine the impact of the SI microbiota of women with and without EED on arterial-remodeling at the
maternal-fetal interface and maternal immune responses to inflammation at the maternal-fetal interface.
Tissue-resident, non-cytotoxic uterine natural killer (uNK) cells produce IFN-𝛾 to remodel uterine spiral arteries
into large luminal decidual arteries that maximize blood flow and nutrient delivery to the fetus. I hypothesize
that maternal EED-associated SI microbiota leads to dysregulated vascular remodeling by impairing uNK cell
function; this in turn reduces fetal growth by limiting nutrient availability. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will use
germ-free (GF), conventionally-raised (CONV-R), and conventionalized mice (CONV-D = GF mice gavaged
with CONV-R cecal contents) to first characterize the effects of the gut microbiota on placental/fetal
development, including placental/decidual histological structures, NK cell composition at early (E11.5) and late
(E17.5) stages of pregnancy. Bulk RNA-seq, single-nucleus RNA-seq, flow cytometry, multiplex assays of
tissue/serum proteins, and histo/immunohistochemical methods will be used to define the cellular
transcriptional/signaling/metabolic profiles of their placenta, decidua, and intestines. The resulting datasets will
be analyzed using a suite of computational tools that I have applied to a substantial amount of preliminary
results. Aim 2 will use groups of gnotobiotic mice colonized with i) a consortium of cultured SI bacteria from
undernourished (low-BMI) Bangladeshi women with EED (based on histopathology of their duodenal mucosa
obtained by endoscopy) and ii) a consortium of cultured SI bacteria from healthy (normal BMI) Bangladeshi
women without histologic evidence of EED. I will apply methods from Aim 1 to E11.5 and E17.5 mice
representing the 2 treatments groups to characterize placental/fetal development (transcriptional, signaling,

development and NK cell biology). These experiments should advance knowledge about how the SI microbiota
in EED impacts the maternal-fetal interface and could yield new therapeutic concepts/targets."
10899999,"In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier leads to
edema accumulation in the lungs which reduces lung compliance and impairs gas exchange. Hypercapnia
(elevated CO2 levels) is often an inevitable consequence of lung protective strategies utilizing low tidal volume
mechanical ventilation in ARDS patients. The repair of the alveolar epithelium following acute lung injury is critical
for lung homeostasis, which is accomplished by alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell self-renewal, and differentiation into
AT1 cells. We and others have reported that exposure to hypercapnia is associated with decreased AT2 cell
proliferation and differentiation and worse clinical outcomes in patients with ARDS. Mitochondrial dysfunction
and metabolic changes are commonly observed in patients with severe ARDS but whether this dysfunction is
causally related to impaired epithelial repair is not known. Three tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes,
including isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) produce CO2 making them susceptible to inhibition by mass action
during hypercapnia. We have reported that elevated CO2 levels inhibit IDH2 in alveolar epithelial cells to activate
downstream signaling pathways to impair alveolar epithelial barrier function and increase mortality in a murine
model of ARDS induced by influenza A pneumonia. Our new preliminary data suggest inhibition of the TCA cycle
by hypercapnia activates the integrated stress response (ISR) via OMA1, DELE1 and HRI, altering the alveolar
epithelial cell state and increasing alveolar-capillary permeability. Further preliminary data suggest that
hypercapnia-induced pathologic ISR activation causes AT2 cells to stall in a transitional state, precluding normal
lung repair after injury via upregulation of ATF4. Collectively, we hypothesize that hypercapnia inhibits the TCA
cycle and activates the ISR via the OMA1/DELE1 and HRI axis to induce an ATF4-mediated increase in alveolar
epithelial permeability and stall the differentiation of AT2 into AT1 cells. We will test this hypothesis via three
interrelated Specific Aims: Aim 1. To determine whether hypercapnia-induced TCA cycle inhibition
activates the ISR and ATF4 to impair alveolar epithelial permeability. Aim 2. To determine whether
hypercapnia inhibits the TCA cycle to activate the ISR via OMA1, DELE1 and HRI. Aim 3. To determine
whether hypercapnia-induced pathologic ISR activation activates ATF4 to inhibit alveolar epithelial
differentiation and delay lung repair after injury. We propose causal experiments using sophisticated genetic
murine models to link hypercapnia to mitochondrial metabolism, ISR activation and failed epithelial differentiation
to worsened lung injury and inhibition of lung repair. As hypercapnia is often an inevitable clinical consequence
of lung injury and lung protective ventilation strategies, mitigating its effects by ISRIB or other small molecules
may improve patient survival and improve recovery after lung injury."

The TB Research And Mentorship Program (TB RAMP) prepares early-stage investigators (post-doctoral
fellows, clinical fellows, junior faculty) from University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and UC Berkeley for
successful careers in tuberculosis (TB) research. Through this research education program focused on TB, we
promote and catalyze collaborations between existing faculty across disciplines (infectious diseases, pulmonary
medicine, experimental medicine, systems biology, genomics, immunology, health economics, pharmacy,
nursing, implementation sciences, diplomacy and policy, global health, etc.); attract and cultivate scholars and
junior investigators in the TB field; and strengthen TB research expertise regionally and globally. TB RAMP
leverages the extensive NIH-funded training resources at UCSF to have a significant and lasting impact on the
conduct of global TB research, as well as on innovations in TB discovery, care and control. Specific Aim 1: The
TB Science Intensive. A two-week TB Science Intensive (TBSI) curriculum will be developed and delivered
annually to TB RAMP scholars to provide the core concepts and methodologies of TB research and includes
skill building in TB RAMP scholars’ own interests and research methods area. The TBSI is enhanced through
delivering content expertise to address TB scientific knowledge gaps and to allow TB RAMP scholars to develop
their own research protocols for subsequent grants. Specific Aim 2: Research Experiences and Awards
Program (REAP). Match scholars with research opportunities through existing transdisciplinary network of
research mentors, faculty, and sites, and support innovative research projects linked to peer-reviewed awards.
Identified program faculty with extensive research experience and opportunities will be paired with scholars
interested in TB research. Research infrastructure at UCSF spans genomics laboratories to state public health
departments. Faculty also have collaborations in high burden settings across Asia, Africa, and the Americas that
will provide TB RAMP scholars access to data, biospecimens, and opportunities to network with faculty from
sites in high-burden settings. Scholars will compete for intramural, peer-reviewed seed funding opportunities.
The goal of the REAP is to provide TB research experiences that expand or extend the existing skills of scholars,
to provide opportunity for meaningful contribution to research related to the NIAID mission, directly addressing
the NIAID Strategic Plan for TB Research. Specific Aim 3: Mentoring Activities. Provide structured, high-
quality, sustained mentoring for all scholars enrolled in the program, differentiated into two tracks to provide
personalization and specialization; Track 1: Basic and Translational Science and Track 2: Clinical and
Operational Science. Creating and nurturing a strong set of mentoring relationships is essential to both core
components of TB RAMP, as is developing a rich set of research networks that can support TB RAMP scholars
throughout their careers. TB RAMP scholars will have the opportunity for additional mentoring from our
international partnered PIs via remote communication."

This R01 renewal application is focused on triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which is an aggressive life-
threatening disease with poor prognosis and increased likelihood of recurrence and distant metastasis.
Advances in cancer immunotherapy have demonstrated that modulation of the patient’s immune system can
result in dramatic antitumor activity. The most promising immunotherapy approaches are those that are
personalized and take advantage of the unique neoantigens within each patient’s tumor. Toward this goal, we
developed a plant virus nanoparticle immunotherapy approach that activates innate immune cells within
the tumor microenvironment (TME) to launch adaptive, systemic, and durable antitumor immunity.
Specifically, intratumorally injected cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) demonstrates potent efficacy in multiple mouse
models, incl. TNBC. Trials in companion dogs with breast cancer also demonstrate potent antitumor efficacy.
During the previous funding cycle, we gained insights into the mechanism of action and demonstrated that
CPMV is recognized by pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) receptors that detect danger signals
and activate the innate immune system; specifically, CPMV is recognized by Toll-like receptors (TLR2, 4 and 7).
Further, we developed and tested combination and dual-pronged treatment approaches: we demonstrated
efficacy of CPMV as solo-treatment as well as in combination with radiation, chemotherapy, immunomodulatory
drugs, and checkpoint inhibitors, amongst others. This proposal builds on this strong portfolio of data. Our first
goal is to focus on dual-pronged CPMV that combines its immunomodulatory and antitumor immunity properties
with checkpoint therapy (Aim 1). Checkpoint blocking antibodies are effective at removing inhibitory signals but
as monotherapy have variable and limited efficacy. In situ vaccination with CPMV increases tumor antigen
specific effector T cells and our preliminary data indicate that CPMV treatment synergizes with immune
checkpoint therapy. Next, we seek to develop targeted approaches that effectively concentrate systemically
administered CPMV in tumors and provide further therapy options to treat metastatic disease (Aim 2). S100A9-
targeted CPMV will be studied: expression of S100A9 (also known as myeloid-related protein 14 [MRP-14]), is
linked to inflammation and carcinogenesis. Higher S100A9 expression in breast cancer correlates with a worse
prognosis. S100A9 expression is an early event in tumorigenesis, enhancing tumor aggressiveness and
metastasis. In the TME, S100A9 is secreted to the extracellular matrix, making it a highly suitable target for
nanomedicine. Recognizing the potential of S100A9 as a pharmacologic target, we developed S100A9-targeted
CPMV that efficiently concentrates at sites of metastasis enabling potent efficacy preventing outgrowth of
metastases. Here we set out to detail the mechanisms of action and understand the pharmacology of S100A9-
targeted CPMV. Finally, the preclinical development will be substantially extended with veterinary clinical trials
in companion dogs with mammary tumors (Aim 3)."
10903780,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate: Nora Becker, MD, PhD, is a primary care physician, health economist, and early career health
services researcher. Her long-term career objective is to become an independent physician-investigator and
national expert on the impact of illness on financial outcomes for women and vulnerable populations in order to
inform policies to reduce disparities and protect patients from financial harm.
Research Context: The financial consequences of illness—termed “financial toxicity”—are important patient
outcomes. Financial toxicity has two components, objective financial burden and subjective financial distress,
but the lack of available data has made it difficult to measure objective financial burden. Further, the existing
measures of subjective financial distress are limited and heterogeneous. The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)
pandemic has made it even more important to develop new ways to estimate and understand the magnitude of
financial toxicity following acute illness.
Specific Aims: 1) Identify patient subgroups at highest risk for objective financial burden after COVID-19
infection; 2) Estimate the causal effect of COVID-19 infection on objective financial burden independent of
economic trends during the pandemic and describe heterogeneity in outcomes by patient subgroup; 3) Assess
subjective financial distress related to COVID-19 infection.
Research Plan: In Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Becker will perform a novel data linkage of commercial credit report data,
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan (BCBSM) insurance claims, and zip code-level social determinants of
health. In Aim 1 she will use machine learning methods to identify which patients are at highest risk of poor
credit report outcomes after COVID-19 infection, and in Aim 2 she will use advanced econometric methods to
estimate the effect of COVID-19 infection on credit report outcomes, independent of overall economic trends
during the pandemic, and describe heterogeneity in outcomes by patient subgroups. In Aim 3, Dr. Becker will
adapt, pilot, and administer a new COVID-19-specific survey measure of subjective financial distress.
Together, these aims will comprehensively estimate the financial toxicity of COVID-19 infection.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Becker will develop expertise in 1) machine learning methods, 2) newly
developed advanced econometric methods, 3) primary data collection and survey methods, and 4) leadership
and communication skills to disseminate her work effectively to inform policy change. Dr. Becker's training will
be supported by close mentorship, advanced didactic coursework, participation in career development
activities, and engagement with media and policymakers to share the results of her research.
Research Goals: The goal of this research is to identify the financial effects of COVID-19 infection, and which
patients are most at risk of financial harm following infection, to inform the development of policies to reduce
disparities in financial outcomes and better protect patients from the financial consequences of illness."
10876032,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic wounds are a serious problem that affects the health and quality of life of patients with diabetes and
cardiovascular diseases. These non-healing ulcers are characterized by prolonged inflammation, poor
vascularization, callus formation, and infection. Advanced wound care is estimated to cost over $10 Billion
annually in the U.S. and is expected to increase as our population ages. A variety of advanced wound care
products have been developed to deliver cellular growth factors, particularly fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), to
the wound site to treat debilitating non-healing ulcers. However, poor efficacy has frequently been reported in
clinical studies involving FGF delivery to wounds due to the following major obstacles: 1) the poor stability and
proteolytic susceptibility of growth factors in vivo, 2) the difficulty of providing a controlled and sustained delivery
of the growth factors, and 3) a lack of biomarkers to evaluate efficacy and to guide the development of new
therapies. The overall objective of the proposal is to address these challenges through an integrative effort to
develop a hyperstable and bioactive wt-FGF1-FGF2 dimer for effective healing of diabetic skin wounds. The
efficacy of this new therapeutic approach will be monitored by quantitative in vivo metabolic imaging.
The overall objective of this proposal is achieved by: 1) designing of a hyperstable and bioactive FGF1-FGF2
dimer and its hyperstable variants; 2) developing the injectable anionic hydrogels made of gelatin-modified
poly(oligo ethylene glycol monoacrylate-co-acrylic acid) – P(OEGA-co-AA), which can provide sustained release
of the different variants of the FGF1-FGF2 dimer; and, 3) to monitor metabolic of wt-FGF1-FGF2 dimer and its
hyperstable variants using simultaneous acquisition of multiphoton images of NADH and FAD auto fluorescence,
as well as collagen SHG intensity. Further, non-invasive Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy (DRS) will be used
to evaluate angiogenesis activity, plausibly triggered by the FGF2 component of the designed FGF1-FGF2 dimer
and its variants."
10876152,"Antibiotic resistance has been recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the three major threats to
human health. Multi-drug resistant organisms (MDR) such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Novel approaches are needed to limit the emergence of MDR
bacteria, track and prevent their spread, and implement innovative strategies to eliminate them from colonizing
niches. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing afford an unprecedented opportunity to simultaneously
obtain information on the genomic make-up of infectious isolates and their mechanisms of drug resistance and
virulence and identify pathogen transmission within health-care facilities. Moreover, we are only now beginning
to understand the contribution of the microbiota to human health through 16S rRNA sequencing. My Mentoring
Program will train the next generation of Infectious Diseases clinicians, researchers and clinical microbiologists
in leveraging the rich genomic information into patient-oriented research (POR) and clinical decision-making.
In my program, trainees will be mentored through research projects, individual meetings and didactics to address
how antimicrobial resistance spreads and evolves. I outline three major areas of research in my laboratory, which
form the basis for potential projects for my mentees. These serve as examples of the different research directions
trainees can pursue. Core projects focus on metagenomic features of gut colonization and clearance of MDROs,
progression to systemic or urinary tract infections (Aims 1 and 4), and how these are affected by antibiotic
treatment. Results will provide building blocks for clinical management of MDR colonization that is informed by
the gut microbiome, such as future diagnostic and therapeutic targets. For Aim 2, we will study the contribution
of the gut microbiome to non-infectious complications of liver transplantation, specifically acute cellular rejection.
These projects illustrate how the resources I built will empower research by trainees and fellows from different
disciplines and with distinct scientific interests. We will take advantage of innovative tools developed in my lab,
including long-read sequencing and metagenomics. My mentoring program will provide trainees with the skills
needed to articulate their own research directions in antimicrobial drug resistance, molecular epidemiology, or
hospital epidemiology. Trained mentees will be in a position to apply novel approaches to study the evolution of
drug resistance and explore how intestinal microbial communities contribute to pathogen colonization and long-
term non-infectious complications such as allograft rejection in liver transplant patients. Through these studies
they will publish scholarly work and obtain grant support, thus launching them on the path to independence. I
will serve as the primary mentor for each trainee. The program will combine my strong personal commitment to
creating effective mentoring relationships with a comprehensive institutional program of training for young
investigators. This research has direct translational impact in establishing a framework to track the emergence
of MDROs that will inform novel diagnostic and therapeutic containment strategies."

The overarching goal of the NYU Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) is to train students to move fluidly
between the realms of rigorous experimental or computational biology and compassionate, evidence-based care
of patients. We aim to train future physician-scientists who will make significant contributions to the advancement
of biomedical science and health care and who will become the next generation of national leaders of academic
medicine. The mechanism whereby we propose to accomplish these goals is to select a group of highly
accomplished and motivated students who will complete both our medical and graduate curricula and finish our
program with a dual MD and PhD degrees. Central to our Program is NYU School of Medicine (NYUSoM) and
the Sackler Institute of Graduate Biomedical Sciences (SIGBS). The former is among the oldest in the nation with
a long history of transformative biomedical research and a current ranking in the top 10 of research medical schools.
The latter supports 16 training programs, confers PhD degrees, and emphasizes biostatistics & exploratory data
analysis, grant writing, rigor and reproducibility, responsible conduct of research, and individual development
plan. Importantly, our proposed MSTP is far more than the sum of these two parts. With more than a half-century
of experience, our MSTP has evolved into a carefully constructed program that adds tremendous value to medical
and graduate training. Value added components of the MSTP include academic/scientific (e.g. faculty and student
organized seminars, annual retreats, and physician-scientist role model lunches), clinical enrichment during
graduate school (e.g. clinicopathological conferences, medical grand rounds, and clinical preceptorships),
community building (e.g. Big Sib program, mental wellness, student organized outings, and an annual retreat),
and an extensive system of advising with emphasis on career development. We offer three pathways through the
MSTP curriculum: a traditional pathway that incorporates graduate work in between the pre-clerkship and
clerkship portions of medical school, one that allows for some clinical clerkships before graduate work, and an
accelerated pathway that allows students to enter the three-year medical school curriculum that includes transition
to post-graduate residency training at NYU. Paramount in our program is mentoring. Our 98 training faculty
were selected from a pool of more than 230 principal investigators at NYUSoM to offer training in a wide spectrum
cutting-edge biomedical research. All participating faculty above the rank of assistant professor have outstanding
training records that demonstrate high standards of mentoring. They receive mandatory training in lab
management and mentoring. Our trainees are selected from an exceedingly qualified pool of applicants. The
program is highly competitive; this year we received 469 applications for a class of 10-12. Students are selected
based on scholastic achievement, passion for and accomplishment in biomedical research, and the qualities of
professionalism, judgement and empathy that are required of physicians. Great effort is made to enhance diversity
by recruiting and retaining underrepresented minority students."
10877811,"The mammalian germline must be reprogrammed to facilitate proper development. This reprogramming, which
includes the erasure of DNA methylation and histone modifications, ensures the establishment of gamete-
appropriate epigenetic patterns and minimizes the transmission of epimutations to offspring. While much of the
genome undergoes replication-coupled passive DNA demethylation, a critical role for Ten-eleven Translocation
(TET) family enzymes, specifically TET1, has been demonstrated for active demethylation of genomic
sequences such as imprinting control regions (ICRs) and germline-specific genes. The proposed work will use
newly developed mouse strains and sequencing technologies to test the hypothesis that iterative oxidation and
noncatalytic functions of TET1 are required for DNA methylation erasure and reprogramming of the mouse
genome, including ICRs and meiosis-specific genes, during germline and somatic development. TET enzymes
can catalyze up to three successive oxidations of 5-methylcytosine (5mC), generating 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), or 5-carboxycytosine (5caC). Oxidized 5mC bases, particularly 5hmC, can
play independent epigenetic roles in somatic tissues including the brain, but are most significantly thought to
function as DNA demethylation intermediates. The distinctive demethylation pathways supported by 5hmC
versus 5fC/5caC have confounded efforts to decipher the precise mechanistic role for TET1. Yet further
challenges are posed by potential non-catalytic roles for TET1, which is known to interact with chromatin
modifying enzymes. Published work and our preliminary data suggest that a role for catalytic and non-catalytic
TET1 activities for demethylation, but the mechanism, timing and target sequences remain incompletely
understood. Thus, we propose to address (1) whether iterative oxidation to 5fC/5caC is required for
reprogramming, (2) whether TET1 has a noncatalytic reprogramming role, and (3) what sequences require
various TET activities. Specific Aim 1 will examine the precise role of TET1 in reprogramming at ICRs and
genome-wide in primordial germ cells (PGCs). We have engineered mice that either stall 5mC oxidation at
5hmC (Tet1v) or lack catalytic function (Tet1hxd) and will test their effects on DNA methylation reprogramming
using our new technology which resolves 5mC and 5hmC, and profile associated chromatin dynamics during
PGC development. Our preliminary data using the new Infinium Mouse BeadChip suggest that the Tet1 mutant
mice sperm have non-overlapping aberrant patterns of DNA modification. Thus, Specific Aim 2 will assess the
epigenomic and phenotypic consequences of Tet1 mutations in homozygous mutant gametes and the offspring
that arise from these gametes. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will determine the epigenomic and phenotypic
consequences of Tet1 stalling and catalytic mutations in homozygous mutant adult and aging mice. This work
will enable an assessment of the role of TET enzymes in genome reprogramming, dissecting the requirement
of noncatalytic activity and iterative oxidation by TET enzymes."
10877816,"Approximately 13,000 new cases of adult AML are diagnosed each year in the U.S. Unfortunately for these
patients, treatment options have remained essentially unchanged for 30 years, and clinical outcomes remain
poor. Moreover, little is known about the genes that regulate leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which represent the
population of blasts that is resistant to chemotherapy and are critical for maintaining disease and re-initiating
disease after therapy. Thus, eradication of the LSC is a prerequisite for cure.
 We recently identified a novel LSC antigen, CD99, that is expressed in the vast majority (~85%) of human
AMLs [3]. We have shown that CD99 is expressed on leukemic blasts and can be used to prospectively separate
leukemic blasts from residual hematopoiesis, similar to LSC antigens such as TIM3 and CD47, but CD99 exhibits
several unique features: 1) CD99 is the most commonly expressed LSC antigen; 2) CD99 does not just mark
LSCs, but regulates blast growth and survival; 3) CD99 allows isolation of LSCs from blasts with CD99hi blasts
enriched ~10-100 fold for leukemia initiating-cell activity over CD99low cells; 4) CD99 is the only LSC antigen
that can identify LSCs in both CD34+ and CD34- AMLs; and, 5) Novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against
CD99 induce cell death directly by activating Src-family kinases (SFKs).
 We have evaluated the consequences of CD99 loss in both LSCs and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Our
studies indicate that decreased expression of CD99 in both LSCs and HSCs results in global upregulation of
protein synthesis and loss of self-renewal. Moreover, cytotoxic mAbs against CD99 mimic the effects of CD99
loss, activating protein synthesis and inducing similar gene expression changes to those observed in CD99 null
HSCs or CD99low blasts in most genetic subtypes of AML tested. Collectively, these data support a model in
which LSCs require highly regulated levels of protein synthesis, similar to HSCs, and based on our work in
normal HSCs, we expect these alterations in translation to result in selective recruitment of mRNA’s to active
translating ribosomes (polysomes). Overall, we hypothesize that CD99 constrains the translation of specific
mRNA’s, thereby promoting a translational program required for LSC self-renewal.
 Given our ability to enrich for LSCs, our group is in a unique position to investigate the role of mRNA
translation in LSC function. We have painstakingly optimized methods to perform polysome profiling and RNA-
sequencing from polysome fractions from small numbers of cells, and we have developed a computational
pipeline to identify mRNA’s that are preferentially translated in LSCs. These tools, in combination with unique
reagents such as our CD99 KO mice and cytotoxic CD99 mAbs that mimic CD99 loss, place us in an excellent
position to investigate how CD99 regulates translation in LSCs. Understanding the molecular pathways that
regulate protein synthesis has the potential to help better characterize a poorly understood process in AML
biology and to credential targeting translation using mAbs as a potential therapeutic strategy in AML."
10900122,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome takes the lives of approximately 1,400 infants annually under the age of one and
its etiology remains mostly unknown. Currently SIDS is explained via the triple risk model that proposes that
SIDS occurs in a vulnerable infant during a critical developmental period when triggered by an external stressor,
including failure of the neonate autoresuscitation reflex. Opioid receptors are expressed in brainstem regions
that are integral for respiratory regulation and are known to contribute to respiratory dysfunction when
homeostatic signaling is disrupted. Previous literature has identified an association between a mutation in the
OPRM1 gene encoding mu opioid receptors (MORs) and SIDS cases, however, investigation of how this gene
and perturbations in its SIDS associated variant of unknown significance modulates respiratory regulation are
poorly understood. In the following aims, I will test the hypothesis that native OPRM1 function is integral to
protective neonate respiratory reflexes and that an OPRM1 SIDS associated nucleotide variant negatively affects
the neonatal autoresuscitation reflex. Aim 1: Does the loss of OPRM1 modulate the neonatal autoresuscitation
reflex and respiratory dynamics following anoxic gas challenges? Aim 2: Determine the role of the 6
transmembrane (6TM) OPRM1 MOR variants in neonatal breathing and the protective autoresuscitation reflex.
To test these aims, I will utilize genetic knockout (KO) mouse models to manipulate global OPRM1 expression
and expression of specific classes of OPRM1 spice variants. For example, the OPRM1 exon 2 KO mouse model
produces mice that do not express OPRM1 whereas the exon 11 and exon 1 KO mouse models only produce
full length 7 transmembrane (TM) MOR variants or truncated 6TM variants, respectively. For functional
characterization of respiratory dynamics, mice will be challenged with repeated sessions of hypercapnic anoxia
to test their autoresuscitation reflex. For assessing network structure and cellular activation patterns, quantitative
spatial transcriptomics will be applied to brainstem tissue of OPRM1 exon 2 KO, exon 11 KO, and exon 1 KO
neonatal mice that have been challenged with bouts of sublethal hypercapnic anoxia. Determining the neuronal
mechanisms of OPRM1 in the neonatal autoresuscitation reflex will provide crucial insight into risk factors
contributing to congenital diseases including SIDS and NAS and may aid in the development of therapeutic
interventions. This study will progress the field by elucidating the role MORs in respiratory regulation and
dysfunction as well as its potential contribution as a risk factor to congenital diseases when expression is
perturbed. This work will significantly aid in identification of the neuronal mechanisms and molecular targets
involved in respiratory dysfunction underlying disease. The training plan and environment that accompany this
proposal comprise of scientific and professional development courses, workshops, scientific seminars, and an
environment enriched with technology at the forefront of the field which will provide a provident foundation for a
transition to research independence."

10901522,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity is a global health concern as it is a risk factor for several of the leading causes of death such as heart
disease, kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes. Obesity drives dysregulated inflammation, which has been
shown to be a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in certain pulmonary viral infections such as
influenza A and SARS-CoV-2. Yet it is unknown how diet induced obesity (DIO)-associated inflammation
impacts the immune response to viruses that infect the gastrointestinal tract. It has been well-established that
DIO drives dynamic changes in intestinal immunity, including alterations in interferon gamma and IgA
production. Specifically, DIO induces skewing towards type I immunity, which is protective against intracellular
pathogens like viruses. Norovirus (NV) is one of the most prevalent gut viruses, as it is the number one cause
of acute viral gastroenteritis worldwide. However, the effects of DIO induced type 1, or anti-viral, skewing on
immunity to NV have yet to be elucidated.
My new preliminary data indicate that mice placed on a high fat diet (HFD) prior to infection with persistent
murine NV (MNV) strain CR6 clear the infection in just 28 days, while mice fed normal chow (NC) remain
persistently infected. This clearance appears to be independent of MNV receptor expression and viral tropism.
Additionally, we found that obese patients with symptoms of gastroenteritis are less likely to test positive for NV
than symptomatic lean controls, which further supports our mouse model indicating a HFD is protective against
NV infection in both mice and humans. We also observe changes in the humoral response to MNV in our
mouse model, as HFD-fed mice have an increase in serum MNV specific IgG and decrease in both serum and
secretory MNV specific IgA in comparison to infected mice on NC. These findings lead to my central
hypothesis that obesity drives alterations in intestinal immunity that promote an anti-viral state and
protect against norovirus infection. I have proposed two aims to address this hypothesis. In Aim 1, I will
elucidate the role of DIO-mediated changes in B and T cell responses in protection against MNV infection. In
Aim 2, I will determine the role of interferon signaling in DIO-associated clearance of MNV. This novel work will
advance our understanding of the relationship between diet and immunity to NV infection. This work also has
translational potential as it may provide insight to treatment for NV, as there is currently no vaccine for this
common virus."
10901111,"Prioritization algorithms for docking trillion-scale small molecule libraries: Abstract
The advent of make-on-demand molecular libraries has significantly expanded the number of readily accessible
molecules and enabled the discovery of new chemotypes through structure-based docking. However, the
libraries have now grown beyond the ability of even the fastest methods to explicitly dock them – and show no
sign of slowdown.
Various strategies have been explored to prioritize molecules to dock from large collections, including machine
learning (ML) methods. However, applying ML for chemical matter prioritization has limitations. Insufficient
experimental data for training means that the models are often trained on docking results, replicating the
inaccuracies of the docking algorithm. Additionally, the models may be biased towards specific chemotypes,
reducing novelty. Moreover, generating 3D conformations, which is crucial for accurate predictions, poses
computational challenges.
To overcome these limitations, I propose an iterative prioritization approach for docking trillion-scale libraries.
The method involves docking a small random subset of the library to the receptor, focusing on molecules similar
to high-scoring compounds from previous rounds while ensuring exploration of new chemical space. This
approach significantly reduces the number of explicitly docked molecules while greatly enriching the docked
subset with promising candidates.
The advantages of this approach include its efficiency, comparable to general ML methods, and its
methodological transparency. The specific aims of the study are twofold. First, I will develop and test algorithms
for iteratively docking subsets of ultra-large small molecule libraries. Different molecular descriptors and
parameters will be retrospectively tested using data from earlier large-scale docking screens from the Shoichet
lab. The final algorithm along with the best-performing parameters will be made publicly available.
Second, the new methods will be applied to predict and test new ligands, examining the idea that larger libraries
lead to the discovery of more potent molecules. Screening the ~60 billion presently available molecules against
AmpC β-lactamase will allow comparison with previous docking results, and selected compounds will be
experimentally tested. Furthermore, co-crystal structures of the most potent binders identified will be solved.
This project addresses the barrier posed by the expanding chemical space and aims to accelerate ligand
discovery for the whole community. The feasibility of the approach is supported by promising preliminary results."
10904734,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mosquito disease transmission relies on the insect’s ability to feed on human hosts, a behavior driven by host-
associated sensory cues. Temperature and humidity are key short-range cues that promote the final stages of
host approach and biting, but little is known about the molecular and cellular basis of mosquito responses to
these cues, or whether these mechanisms are conserved among evolutionarily distant mosquitoes.
We propose to address these knowledge gaps by: 1) Probing the molecular basis and evolutionary conservation
of heat-seeking between the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae (An. gambiae) and the dengue vector Aedes
aegypti (Ae. aegypti). 2) Investigating the (as yet unknown) molecular and cellular basis of mosquito humidity
sensation in An. gambiae. We propose to achieve these goals in three aims:
Aim 1) Probe the evolutionary conservation of heat seeking mechanisms. Mosquito blood-feeding
is thought to have a common evolutionary origin, but whether the mechanisms that control heat-seeking are
conserved across mosquitoes is an open question. We will test this conservation by comparing the roles of key
receptors implicated in heat-seeking in multiple mosquito species in order to reveal whether and in what ways
heat-seeking mechanisms are shared across vector mosquitoes.
Aim 2) Determine the sensory specificities of candidate humidity receptor-expressing neurons
in An. gambiae. Despite its importance for host seeking, mosquito humidity sensing is largely unexplored.
We will test the hypothesis that mosquito humidity sensors rely on relatives of receptors important for sensing
humidity in Drosophila. We will examine the stimulus sensitivities of the sensory neurons expressing these
receptors and test the role(s) of these receptors in detecting sensory stimuli.
Aim 3) Establish the behavioral roles of candidate hygroin An. gambiae. We will test how our
candidate receptors for humidity and temperature contribute to the mosquito’s behavioral responses to
humidity and temperature, as well as host seeking and blood feeding. We will also compare how host-seeking
roles relate to homeostatic roles in helping modulate body temperature and hydration state.
This work will identify molecular receptors and sensory neurons that detect temperature and humidity in
vector mosquitoes and establish their roles in mosquito host seeking and blood feeding. As these behaviors
supports disease transmission, these basic science findings have potential relevance for vector control efforts."

This research proposal has been developed to equip the candidate, Dr. Daniel Tyrrell, with knowledge,
experience, and skills to successfully transition into an independent faculty position. The proposed research
will examine mechanisms of why older adults are at increased risk of vascular disease. Vascular pathology in
the brain is present in up to 80% of people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and vascular dementia is the second
leading dementia behind AD. Dr. Tyrrell will have guidance from his mentors, Dr. Daniel Goldstein and Dr.
Michael Wang, and assistance from members of the Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center along
with experts in diverse fields who will contribute to Dr. Tyrrell’s training. Dr. Tyrrell has discovered that cerebral
blood vessels in aged mice have evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction leading to increased STING-IL-6
inflammation and blood-brain barrier breakdown. The mechanisms of vascular contributions to cognitive
impairment and dementias (VCID) in aging remain unclear. Therefore, the objective of this study is to
determine how cerebrovascular mitochondrial dysfunction impacts cognitive function in aging. Hence,
Aim 1 will determine how age-related cerebrovascular mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction impacts the
blood-brain barrier and cognitive function during natural aging and in a model of vascular dementia induced by
cerebral hypoperfusion. Aim 2 will examine how cerebrovascular inflammation impacts the BBB and cognitive
function in a model of vascular dementia with aging. Dr. Tyrrell will employ novel mitophagy reporter mice and
mice with enhanced mitochondrial function in addition to using cell-type specific conditional knockout mouse
models and pharmacologic approaches. Dr. Tyrrell will acquire both technical and scientific neurobiology
expertise in order to study blood-brain barrier integrity and cognitive function in aging to distinguish himself
from his mentors and allow him to develop a cutting-edge independent career in examining VCID."
10904739,"Concussion in youth is increasingly being recognized as a national health concern, affecting more than one
million youth each year. As many as 30% of youth with concussion experience persistent and disabling
concussive symptoms lasting more than one month, defined as Persistent Post-Concussive Symptoms
(PPCS). PPCS interferes with social relationships and adversely impacts physical and academic function.
Previous recommendations for treating PPCS focused on cognitive and physical rest, but in 2016 guidelines
shifted based on new research suggesting the benefit of rehabilitative exercise. The rationale behind the use of
exercise is that gradual increases in the intensity of physical activity facilitates return to full function.
Rehabilitative exercise has since become one of the most common approaches to treating youth with PPCS.
However, most programs require weekly centralized visits with a concussion specialist, creating barriers to
care. To bridge this gap, we developed an mHealth approach to treat PPCS, utilizing physical activity trackers
(Fitbits) and weekly video conferences with trained research staff to eliminate the need for frequent clinical
visits. We conducted a series of pilot studies with this approach, finding excellent feasibility, acceptability, and
evidence for more rapid declines in concussive symptoms compared to controls. We also found preliminary
evidence that mechanisms behind this intervention may stem from both physiologic processes due to
increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and psychologic processes such as reducing fear-
avoidance of concussive symptoms. We thus propose a fully powered, randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
rigorously examine the “Mobile Subthreshold Exercise Program” (M-STEP) for youth with PPCS. We will recruit
n=250 youth ages 11-18 years with PPCS lasting 1 to 6 months, and randomize them to 6 weeks of either
usual care plus M-STEP (intervention) or usual care plus stretching (control). Youth in M-STEP will be coached
through gradual increases in intensity and duration of rehabilitative exercise via weekly video conferencing
(Zoom) and will use Fitbits to guide their progress. Youth in the stretching group will act as attention controls,
with equivalent study contacts. All youth will complete research-grade measures of MVPA using actigraphy
and standardized surveys at multiple time points. Youth will be followed for a total of 6 months. We will use
mixed effects models to examine differences between experimental groups in the primary outcome, trajectory
of concussive symptoms, and the secondary outcome, changes over time in health-related quality of life, on an
intention-to-treat basis. The proposed transdisciplinary R01 RCT will provide definitive information
regarding the efficacy of M-STEP for youth with PPCS, examine potential mediators including MVPA
and fear-avoidance, and explore the impact of biopsychosocial factors (patient sex and parental
protective behaviors)."

Research has yet to understand why some with psychotic-like experiences (PLEs; early markers of psychosis
risk) transition to psychosis spectrum disorders whereas others report only transient PLEs. This information will
be critical for understanding the etiology of psychosis spectrum symptoms and for prevention and intervention
efforts for this major public health concern (~90% of individuals with significant PLEs report mental health
diagnoses in adulthood). According to the expanded proneness-persistence-impairment (PPI) model, potential
distinguishing factors between transient PLEs and those transitioning to psychotic disorders is whether they are
sustained and distressing (i.e., sustained dPLEs). Consistent with NIMH Strategic Objective 2, this K23
application will fill critical missing gaps in the literature by characterizing the key risk factors and clinical
significance of early sustained dPLEs. The application will focus on ~11,800 children from the Adolescent Brain
and Cognitive Development study initially aged 9-11-years-old followed annually over the course of the award.
The analyses will test PPI model hypotheses, including investigating the most important factors distinguishing
sustained from transient dPLEs, examining neurobiological correlates (e.g., resting state functional connectivity,
cortical thickness, cognitive functioning), family history of psychosis, motor and speech developmental delays,
and environmental predictors (adverse childhood experiences, cannabis use; Aim 1). Models will also test
whether longitudinal changes in cognitive, neural predictors, and environmental risk factors distinguish sustained
versus transient dPLEs (Aim 2). Lastly, the application will also fill a critical research gap by examining the clinical
significance of sustained dPLEs, examining the social and educational functional impairments, treatment seeking
behavior, and conducting additional data collection when the youth are ages 16 to 18 to assess the base rates
of attenuated psychosis syndrome (APS) among youth endorsing sustained dPLEs (Aim 3). To assess rates of
APS, the applicant and a masters-level clinician will interview a subset of ABCD participants (n=500) and their
parents/caregivers using the Structured Interview of Prodromal Syndromes. Overall, the applicant will implement
rigorous practices, including running all analyses for the aims and hypotheses outlined below on two-thirds of
data and then replicating the exact same models on an untouched one-third of data. Under the mentorship of a
diverse team of experts of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology, longitudinal analyses, machine
learning, and neuroimaging analyses, this scientifically rigorous proposal will test hypotheses regarding cross-
sectional and longitudinal predictors of sustained versus transient dPLEs for the future application of early
identification and preventative interventions. The application addresses several gaps in the applicant’s training
that are critical for success as an independent clinical investigator, including the need for further training in
advanced statistical techniques (e.g., machine learning, longitudinal analyses, neuroimaging analyses) and
increased exposure in the area of developmental psychosis spectrum psychopathology."
10904995,"ABSTRACT
Pancreatic cancer is characterized by an extensive fibroinflammatory reaction, or tumor stroma. While immune
cells are abundant within the stroma, they are largely immune suppressive, and therefore pancreatic cancer is
largely unresponsive to immunotherapy. Genetically engineered mouse models of pancreatic cancer
recapitulate the stepwise progression of pancreatic cancer, and are ideal to study precursor lesions, such as
pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). Analysis of the immune infiltrates at the PanIN stage revealed that
immune suppression is established very early on and precedes malignant progression. The mechanisms
underlying the establishment of the immune suppression in pancreatic cancer remain unknown and
understanding them is of fundamental importance to design new chemotherapy approaches for pancreatic
cancer. We previously used single cell RNA sequencing to characterize gene expression profiles in the human
pancreatic cancer immune infiltrate. We then mapped potential cell-cell interactions within the microenvironment
based on reciprocal expression of ligands and receptors. Among predicted interactions, we identified WNT
signaling activation in the T cell compartment of pancreatic cancer, driven by ligands expressed by tumor cells
and cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We and others have previously associated inappropriate activation of
embryonic signaling pathways, including WNT signaling, as a characteristic of pancreatic cancer. WNT signaling
is one of the core pathways activated in pancreatic cancer. We previously showed that ablation of epithelial WNT
signaling inhibits the onset of pancreatic carcinogenesis, but the potential role of WNT in the pancreatic cancer
microenvironment and specifically in immune cells is unknown. CAFs express several ligands of the WNT family;
to ablate their expression, we inactivated PORCN (PORCUPINE), a transmembrane enzyme required for
acylation and secretion of WNT ligands, in pancreatic fibroblasts. We then transplanted pancreatic cancer cells
and observed reduced growth. To determine whether T cell activation of WNT signaling was important for this
effect, we generated mice where the transcription factors TCF7, encoding for the protein TCF1, was inactivated
in CD4+ T cells. In these animals, we observed reduced growth of transplanted tumors, alterations in the CAF
phenotype, and increased activation of anti-tumor immunity. In this proposal, we plan to build on our preliminary
data to dissect the mechanism of WNT signaling driven immune suppression in pancreatic cancer. The long term
goal is to design targeting approaches that might reverse immune suppression in this disease."
10901121,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating illness with an annual incidence of 200,000 and
a mortality of 40%. Endothelial barrier dysfunction is critical for the pathogenesis of vascular permeability and
the resulting tissue edema and profound hypoxia seen in ARDS. Endothelial barrier dysfunction in ARDS is a
complex phenomenon involving cytoskeletal changes in response to pro-inflammatory mediators, which can also
precipitate endothelial cell apoptosis, a programmed form of cell death. While cytoskeletal changes are reversible
and are eventually followed by recovery of the endothelial barrier, endothelial cell apoptosis represents a final
cellular fate and determinant of endothelial barrier disruption. In fact, after apoptotic-endothelial injury, restoration
of barrier function requires endothelial cell proliferation, migration and/or endothelial progenitor cell seeding.
Therefore, a transition point likely exists between pro-apoptotic signaling (injury phase) and pro-proliferative
signaling (recovery phase) leading to endothelial barrier restoration; further insight into which would identify
therapeutic targets that not only reduce severity of ARDS but also facilitate recovery.
Our laboratory has identified non-canonical functions for caspase 3, a terminal enzyme of the apoptotic cascade.
Traditionally, activation of caspase 3 had been considered as the point of no return in the execution of apoptosis.
We identified a disconnect between activation of caspase 3 and the execution of apoptosis. In initial work, we
found loss of the signaling molecule mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), resulted
in prevention of both apoptosis and endothelial barrier dysfunction despite activation of caspase 3. Interestingly,
in these experiments active caspase 3 was sequestered in the cytoplasm. We have also shown caspase 3
enhances barrier integrity is via cytoskeletal changes that increase centrifugal forces, reminiscent of changes
required for cellular migration. We have exciting preliminary data showing caspase 3 promotes migration and
proliferation. Further, our preliminary data suggests caspase 3 functions via yes activated protein (YAP), a known
regulator of migration and proliferation implicated in angiogenesis and lung development. However, there is little
known about the role of YAP in endothelial barrier recovery following lung injury and the molecular regulators
that initiate YAP signaling in this process. Based on our previous findings and preliminary data, we hypothesize
the association between caspase 3 and MK2 is necessary for nuclear translocation of caspase 3 and the
apoptosis-promoting function of caspase 3. We further hypothesize that inhibiting the association between active
caspase 3 and MK2 converts caspase 3 to a pro-proliferative factor, via YAP signaling, thereby accelerating
endothelial barrier recovery. Thus, the Aims of this study are: 1) determine the mechanisms by which MK2
facilitates transport of caspase 3 into the nucleus in vitro. 2) determine the mechanism(s) of active cytoplasmic
caspase 3 in promoting endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. 3) elucidate the role of cytoplasmic endothelial
caspase 3 in accelerating recovery following lung injury."
10901489,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The number of large-scale multi-site neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by
federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to
the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Such data have been acquired
with an increasing degree of technical harmonization of scanning protocols, which has been beneficial for
reducing inter-site differences. However, extensive evidence from our group and others emphasizes that even
under after careful technical harmonization, site effects dwarf biological effects of interest. Over the past five
years, there has been an explosion of interest in statistical harmonization methods to address this problem. As
part of a highly-successful first project period, our group has pioneered the translation of tools from statistical
genomics – such as the ComBat family of methods – to neuroimaging data. These widely adopted methods use
empirical Bayes to correct for site effects based on the means, variances, and covariances of imaging features.
However, in this context, two key challenges have arisen: missing phenotypes and nonlinear effects. First, as
precision medicine turns to neuroimaging, harmonization in the context of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers
has become a central issue. Our group has shown that harmonization methods that aim to preserve disease
information in imaging data are critical for scientific rigor and reproducibility. However, such information is not
available without knowledge of the phenotype of interest. In these settings, translational investigators are caught
in a catch-22: harmonization is not possible without knowing that individual's diagnosis, which is exactly the
information targeted for prediction. To address this, here we propose to develop new methods that stochastically
impute the phenotype and assess the uncertainty in the predicted harmonization. Second, deep learning has
revolutionized the field of predictive modeling due to its sensitivity to complex nonlinear effects. However, its
flexibility makes it highly sensitive to diverse technical biases. While there have been several initial forays in
using deep learning for harmonization, currently available approaches have critical limitations – such as an
inability to address confounding. In this proposal, we will develop novel hybrid deep statistical methods for
improved harmonization to mitigate nonlinear scanner effects. We will extend these developments to the setting
of longitudinally acquired imaging data, apply these in two large multi-center cohort studies, and release user-
friendly software packages for the imaging science community."
10901123,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Vision is an important driver of our evolution and adaptation to different environments. It is a complex
process that begins with photoreceptor signal transduction in retinal circuitry before transmitting to central brain
targets to drive a range of image-forming visual functions, from color discrimination to navigation. Canonically,
studies on image forming vision in the retina and cortex have largely focused on rod and cone inputs that encode
pattered visual images. However, additional inputs that contribute to complex retinal and cortical computations
from melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (iPRGCs) or sleep are largely
unexplored. Therefore, there is a need to understand how multiplexed photoreceptor inputs mediate retinal and
cortical processes and how such responses are altered with sleep. I hypothesize that multiplexing of rod, cone,
and melanopsin input will allow cortical neurons to respond to visual stimuli with a large range of irradiance under
complex visual features like natural scenes, and that these processes will be modulated by sleep.
 My objectives are to measure melanopsin-specific retinal and cortical responses, use that information to
build a predictive computational model of the early visual system that incorporates multiplexed photoreceptor
inputs, and determine how sleep alters cortical computations for visual processing. I will begin by isolating and
measuring melanopsin-specific responses in the retina and cortex under natural scenes in Aim 1. Then, I will
record responses in the visual cortex under natural scenes at different points of circadian time-of-day and sleep
deprivation in Aim 2. By understanding a detailed quantitative description of how visual experience is
represented in the retina and visual cortex, we will better understand how and why vision loss occurs in diseases
and disorders that affect the early visual system. Furthermore, my work will contribute to the development of
accurate and sophisticated computational models that could improve the design of cortical prosthesis systems
that aim to restore lost vision due to damages or disorders to the visual centers of the brain.
 My Sponsor, Dr. Stephen Baccus, and I have created a training plan to focus on developing my technical,
writing and communication, and mentorship skills. My technical skills will focus heavily on in vivo and in vitro
electrophysiology, microscopy, behavioral assays, computational analysis, and computational modeling. I plan
to register for relevant courses, attend workshops and training events, and network with experts in the field. My
writing and communication skills will be developed by applying for grants/fellowships, manuscript development,
and presenting at conferences. I will develop my mentorship skills by training undergraduate and graduate
students to help run experiments and analyze data. I am part of a highly collaborative research environment with
many world renown experts in the visual neurosciences within my department and sleep neurosciences through
collaborations with adjacent departments. I plan to fully utilize the resources and facilities available to accomplish
the goals of this proposal, as well as achieve my goal of becoming an independent research scientist."
10875033,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT CORE
 The proposed Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Core of Cornell’s Roybal Center–The
Translational Research Institute on Pain in Later Life (TRIPLL)-- will maintain and extend the strategies
TRIPLL’s investigator development program employed over the past 5 years to achieve measurable success.
TRIPLL will support the development and execution of trials that seek to develop and test scalable, efficacious,
and effective behavioral pain treatments for older adults targeting concrete Mechanisms of Behavior Change
(MoBC). This research is crucial given that current behavioral approaches to manage pain provide small-to-
moderate benefits, the mechanisms underlying existing behavioral interventions remain poorly defined, and
few behavioral pain management strategies in this area have advanced beyond the efficacy stage of
development. Cornell’s Roybal Center will focus its translational research efforts on underrepresented
populations, i.e., older adults with cognitive impairment, minority elders, and older adults living in rural areas.
TRIPLL’s BID Core will bring together theoretical and methodological leadership from its team of highly skilled
investigators, External Advisory Committee, Internal Advisory Committee, and Industry Advisory Board to
achieve these goals, conducting national competitions to identify and fund clinical trials that have the potential
to advance to Stages III-V of the NIH Model, consulting with investigators to develop potent and scalable
interventions, ensuring timely project progress and research integrity, assuring timely dissemination of
research results to appropriate audiences, and providing continued methodological support well beyond
completion of the initial study to advance the trial to higher stages. Cornell Roybal Center’s overarching goal is
to disseminate behavioral interventions that measurably improve the health and well-being of aging adults
adversely affected by pain. In the proposed continuation, the specific aims of the Cornell Roybal Center’s BID
Core are to: 1) Maintain a responsive leadership and administrative infrastructure to support intervention
development for later-life pain across the NIH Stage Model; 2) Support and monitor innovative clinical trials
that are anchored in the Mechanisms of Behavior Change MoBC and strive to ensure applicability in
demographically diverse, underrepresented groups; and finally 3) Leverage the intellectual, fiscal, and other
resources of the academic and industry collaborators in this application and foster new collaborations with
other NIA-funded Centers to achieve synergistic results that would not be attainable by any one institution.
 The aims of TRIPLL’s BID Core are significant because behavior change interventions will ultimately be
more effective if the underlying mechanisms driving behavior change are clearly understood. Finally, TRIPLL
pilot studies will leverage new theoretical innovations in the social/behavioral sciences to improve the efficacy,
effectiveness, and dissemination of interventions implemented in aging populations adversely affected by pain."
10875057,"Project Summary / Abstract: Overall
The overall theme of this Roybal Center is to leverage technology to facilitate memory and cognitive function
so that cognitive decline may be prevented or delayed in older adults, and particularly those at-risk of
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). The number of people in the world aged 60 years or
over continues to grow, which is accompanied by a comparable increase in those who will suffer cognitive
impairment. This age-related cognitive decline does not just lower the quality of life for the individual, but at
scale, it will impact every sector of society. Therefore, maintaining or improving cognition in aged adults, even
for a few months, could have an important effect at the population level. In order to reach such a large portion
of the population, the proposed Roybal Center will harness technologies we have recently proved beneficial in
older adults and further develop them to deploy iterative behavioral interventions that offer unparalleled
convenience and affordability. To achieve this, a Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Core and an
Administrative Core will work together to conduct clinical trials and guide intervention development,
respectively. The BID Core will conduct Stage 0 through V studies in accordance with the multidirectional,
translational NIH Stage Model, to produce potent and implementable principle-driven behavioral interventions.
The Administrative Core will support the BID Core by monitoring the project science and compliance, handling
internal and external communication, managing scientific leadership, providing governance, financial oversight,
and infrastructure to promote transdisciplinary interaction and synergy among center components and
collaborators. The specific aims of each core are as follows. BID Core Aim 1. Assessment of efficacy and
effectiveness of behavioral interventions in a community setting. BID Core Aim 2. Refine interventions, assess
feasibility and initial efficacy in a research setting. BID Core Aim 3. Maintain, expand, and enhance Nexus: A
modern behavioral remote intervention platform. Administrative Core Aim 1. Maintain the Center's strategic
vision. Administrative Core Aim 2. Oversee BID projects. Administrative Core Aim 3. Facilitate
collaborative networks. The MPIs of the Roybal Center, Drs. Gazzaley, Wais, and Zanto, draw on their
extensive experience administering large, complex, collaborative, transdisciplinary grants and their proven
ability to take an idea for a behavioral intervention through all the NIH Stages of intervention development. The
MPIs have successfully collaborated for more than 15 years and are co-founders and directors of Neuroscape
at UCSF, a translational research center. Thus, the proposed Roybal Center will seamlessly integrate with their
pre-established method for following the NIH Stage Model to develop interventions and this new Center will
play a key role in guiding future behavioral interventions out of the lab and into people's homes."
10875268,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The focus of this study is on early life factors and their effect on mammary development during puberty and
how they relate to increased breast cancer risk. At this time we do not understand what biological changes
occur during pubertal mammary development which leads to a greater risk of developing cancer in later life.
Identifying the molecular mechanisms that cause aberrant pubertal mammary development may lead to
defined strategies to reduce breast cancer burden in later life.
As our bodies use the sugars that we consume for energy they generate waste chemicals known as
metabolites. One such group of metabolites is known as advanced glycation end products or AGEs for short.
Critically apart from their production as a result of the breakdown of sugar, AGE’s are also formed through the
ingestion of food and by external environmental factors such as lack of exercise. Changes in this dynamic
equilibrium causes protein dysfunction, protein crosslinking, decreased genetic fidelity, altered gene
expression profiles and aberrant cell signaling.
Our studies have identified in animal models that a diet high in AGEs significantly alters how the breast
develops during puberty. The tumor microenvironment is now becoming recognized as having a major role in
facilitating both mammary development and cancer progression, and that, alterations in stromal cell signaling
can precede epithelial cell alterations and act as drivers of the tumorigenic process. Critically, the high AGE
diet produces architecture in the breast that resembles pre-neoplastic lesions with hyper-proliferative structures
and increased levels of stromal cells. We also show that AGE levels are significantly elevated in the circulation
and tumor tissue of breast cancer patients and that AGE treatment alters cancer associated signaling
pathways to promote breast tumor growth.
This study aims to define the mechanism by which a high-AGE diet causes the dysregulation of the mammary
gland during puberty (SA1) and adulthood (SA2) and will ask if the changes observed lead to a higher risk of
breast tumor formation and growth (SA3).
A greater mechanistic understanding of the link between AGE intake during puberty and increased breast
cancer risk may define novel potential strategies for lifestyle and pharmacological intervention aimed at
reducing breast cancer risk at a defined window of susceptibility."

Kabuki syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability and a unique
cognitive profile. Studies in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome have demonstrated
hippocampal memory defects and a disruption of adult neurogenesis in the the dentate gyrus.
Interestingly, these deficits were normalized in postnatal life with agents that inhibit histone
deacetylases, indicating that Kabuki syndrome may be a treatable cause of intellectual
disability. Preliminary data shows that patients with Kabuki syndrome have deficits in
visuospatial reasoning and memory and that these areas are significantly impaired when
compared to IQ-matched controls. This proposal aims to build upon the basic science and
clinical work to localize and characterize cognitive impairments in Kabuki syndrome and
evaluate a potential treatment. If successful, these studies will yield insights into the
pathogenesis of Kabuki syndrome and lead to the first therapeutic strategy. This work has the
potential of establishing robust outcome measures and providing a novel treatment option to a
clinical entity (intellectual disability) that has few therapeutic options.
Specific Aim 1: Determine robust cognitive and behavioral outcome measures that are
valid, reliable, and sensitive in a Kabuki syndrome population. This prospective study will
investigate a Kabuki syndrome-specific cognitive assessment protocol linked to visuospatial
functions and establish reliability and use established behavioral questionnaires to determine
the neurobehavioral phenotype of Kabuki syndrome.
Specific Aim 2: Characterize neuroanatomical features in patients with KMT2D mutations
and provide further evidence of localization of specific impairments. This study done on a
3 Tesla MRI scanner will investigate whether patients with KMT2D mutations have smaller
dentate gyri.
Specific Aim 3: Test whether HDAC inhibition through modified Atkins diet modifies the
neurocognitive or neurobehavioral phenotype in individuals with Kabuki syndrome.
Previously, a ketogenic diet has been shown to ameliorate cognitive and neurohistological
defects in a mouse model of Kabuki syndrome. This proposal aims to conduct a pilot study of 10
adult patients with Kabuki syndrome given 12 weeks of HDAC inhibition through diet and
determine whether performance on the cognitive assessment protocol changes."

The staggering incidence of opioid addiction continues at epidemic levels, disrupting and destroying the lives of
millions of Americans with a yearly financial toll nearing $80 billion. A major hurdle in treating opioid addiction is
a chronic cycle of withdrawal and relapse. Rodent studies have identified long-term changes in gene expression,
epigenetics, and circuit connectivity after opioid exposure and withdrawal, but few studies have investigated the
interaction of these changes across modalities. We recently developed a new class of brain mapping tools based
on cellular barcoding that can relate the three modalities in single cells and experiments. These tools, which
include MAPseq and BARseq, use RNA barcodes to uniquely label thousands of neurons per experiment and
map their inter-regional connections. In each labeled neuron, barcodes are trafficked into the axons, where we
can detect them by high-throughput sequencing. Matching up barcode sequences across potential target regions
then produces the single-cell projection matrix for all barcoded neurons. As barcodes are mRNAs, they are in
the same modality as the endogenous transcriptome, allowing us to natively bridge single-cell connectomic
measurements with single-cell measures of gene expression and genome accessibility in the same cells. Finally,
combination of these technologies with spatial transcriptomics methods, including STARmap and BARseq2, lets
us map the observed changes with high resolution in 3D brain space.
Here we apply our multi-omic tools to measure the changes induced in the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC)
in two rodent models of opioid withdrawal and relapse. Our collaborators in the Shaham lab recently identified
opposing functional connectivity changes in rat mOFC after electric barrier-induced voluntary abstinence. In the
same rat model using our tools, we will define which cell types are responsible for these connectional changes,
how single-cell connection patterns change, and how gene expression, epigenetics, and connectivity changes
interact at the level of single cells. Critically, we define cell types holistically across transcriptomic, epigenomic,
and connectomic modalities. We then compare these changes to those observed in mOFC in a second rodent
model, a classical opioid withdrawal conditioned place aversion (CPA) model in mice. We hope to identify a set
of changes robust to the two behaviors and conserved across species, highlighting them as core features of
opioid withdrawal and relapse. We will causally manipulate epigenetic factors associated with these core
changes by cell-type-specific knockouts and overexpression, and assess their effects on behavior. The public
health impact of this work lies in the fundamental understanding of the long-term circuit changes induced by
opioid withdrawal and relapse at unprecedented multi-omic resolution and the potential identification of a set of
conserved core changes as candidates for treatment."

Organ transplantation is the optimal treatment for end stage organ disease and results in improved patient survival and
quality of life. Black patients have rates of end stage organ disease nearly three times that of white patients, yet comprise
only 20% of organ transplant recipients. The transplant selection process is not standardized across transplant centers and
therefore decision making at each phase of the process is potentially vulnerable to institutional racism. Further, national
transplant data collection and monitoring exclude the transplant selection process. The overall objective of this proposal
is to identify, characterize, and intervene on inequities in organ transplant that occur due to health system processes
which are vulnerable to interpersonal and institutional bias Our central hypothesis is that inadequate attention to equity
promoting principles throughout each phase of the selection process are major contributors to inequitable access to organ
transplant. This project will quantify racial inequities at each phase of the transplant selection process (screening,
evaluation and committee decision making) using electronic health record data, characterize vulnerabilities in the
transplant screening, evaluation and committee decision aming processes that contribute to overall inequities in access
to transplant and design and pilot a toolkit to reduce inequities in the transplant screening, evaluation and committee
decision making processes. This results of this project will elucidate the influence of institutional racism in transplant
systems and processes on racial equity in access to transplant. The research and additional knowledge and skill
development will form a strong foundation for the candidate’s transition to an independent investigator studying
interventions to overcome institutionally biased practices which contribute to organ transplant inequities."

Ribosomes are highly conserved RNA-protein complexes that direct protein synthesis in all cells. Dysregulation
of ribosome production or function is detrimental to gene expression and underlies several disease states. Over
2% of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) nucleotides are modified. These modifications play a critical role in the proper
production of ribosomes that can accurately perform protein synthesis. The two major rRNA modifications are
2’-O-methylation and pseudouridylation that are directed by highly conserved non-coding RNAs called small
nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Altered levels of snoRNAs are associated with human diseases from
neurodegeneration to multiple types of cancer, underscoring their importance for proper cell growth. Therefore,
a key question is how levels of snoRNAs are regulated and how does their dysregulation lead to translation
defects in disease? Despite the textbook perception that rRNA modifications are equally deposited in all
ribosomes, recent advances in mapping modifications have revealed substoichiometric rRNA modification sites,
strongly suggesting that ribosome assembly and function may be regulated by the modification status of rRNA.
A long-term goal of my laboratory is to identify the post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate the abundance
of snoRNAs and understand their contribution to cellular translational control. A prominent rRNA modification in
eukaryotes is 2’-O-methylation, the incorporation of which is guided by snoRNAs of the box C/D class. These
snoRNAs interact with a set of evolutionarily conserved proteins to form ribonucleoprotein complexes
(snoRNPs). The assembly of snoRNPs is highly regulated which, in turn, is important to maintain levels of
snoRNAs and to coordinate this process with other cellular events. However, despite their fundamental
importance, much of these regulatory events remains a black box. We have performed targeted yeast mutational
and suppressor screens of snoRNP assembly factors to determine their essential contributions and identify
genetic pathways that mediate snoRNP biogenesis. Our data indicate that regulation of box C/D snoRNP
production by assembly factors is critically important for control of the modification pattern of rRNAs and
dysregulation of this process alters the biogenesis pathway and the fidelity of ribosomes. Our goal is to combine
the novel genetic tools and reagents that we have recently developed with biochemical assays, structural biology,
proteomics, and next-generation sequencing to answer two key questions: 1) How do regulatory factors control
the steady-state levels of snoRNAs required for accurate modification of rRNA?; and 2) How do changes in
snoRNA levels alter and tune protein synthesis? These studies will provide significant insights into the control of
gene expression by snoRNAs at the translation level, and may inform our view of how snoRNA dysregulation
underlies human disease."

 Identification of genetic and epigenetic changes associated with disease states can
afford deep insight into the underlying molecular processes, but, particularly for diseases of the
central nervous system (CNS), translating this information to new drug therapies remains a
challenge. Here, we will exploit the chemistry of pharmacophores found in psychoactive drugs
to study the impact of genetic variants and epigenetic modifications in addiction. Hydrazine-
based drugs including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) have a long history of success in
treating CNS disorders. The hydrazine group covalently inactivates several classes of enzymes
(e.g. oxidases, oxygenases, demethylases, hydroxylases) in the CNS that participate in
transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling, thereby contributing to a broad range of
biological functions and disease pathologies. I previously developed a novel chemical
proteomics discovery platform (which I dubbed `RP-ABPP) by exploiting the unique reactivity
(reverse polarity, RP) of this pharmacophore to create unbiased probes to target these enzyme
classes by activity-based protein profiling (ABPP). Given the established ability of hydrazine
drugs to reach the CNS and manipulate its biochemistry, this project will implement first-in-
class, nucleophilic brain-penetrating probes using our RP-ABPP platform to discover hydrazine-
sensitive enzymes disrupted in preclinical models of drug addiction. Specifically, these probes
will evaluate changes to the brain during the development of dependence using electronic
nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) with a newly established mouse model of inhalation exposure.
The goals are to i) identify novel druggable enzyme targets that are dysregulated in nicotine
dependence and ii) develop a suite of selective probes that can be used by neuroscientists as
pharmacological tools to study drug abuse and other psychiatric disorders. This platform is
expected to i) create new opportunities to map functional consequences of genetic mutations
and epigenetic modifications in drug dependence, ii) discover new druggable enzyme activities
that can be spatially mapped by imaging, and iii) ultimately create a unique opportunity for
therapeutic development around a relatively underexplored chemical space."

Glioblastoma  (GBM,  or  astrocytoma  grade  IV)  brain  tumor  remains  one  of  the  most  lethal  forms  of  human 
cancer  and  a  major  unmet  need  in  current  oncology.  GBM  is  a  highly  heterogeneous  and  multifactorial 
disease  characterized  by  the  wide  landscape  of  mutations  and  signaling  alterations.  Thus,  most  of  the 
developing experimental therapies will likely only help a fraction of patients. We have discovered microRNA-­
10b  (miR-­10b),  a  regulatory  molecule  whose  transcriptional  activation  emerges  as  a  unique  mechanism 
shared by almost all gliomas, including both high-­grade and low-­grade, despite their heterogeneity. miR-­10b 
regulates  neoplastic  transformation  of  normal  glial  cells  and  the  growth  of  malignant  gliomas.  Moreover,  it 
appears essential for the viability of heterogeneous glioma cells and glioma-­initiating stem cells (GSC). Since 
miR-­10b is highly expressed in practically all malignant gliomas, and its inhibition affects all glioma subtypes, 
miR-­10b targeting represents a common therapeutic strategy for GBM. Despite the high levels and the critical 
role  of  miR-­10b  in  GBM,  how  the  expression  of  this  molecule,  which  is  silenced  in  the  normal  brain,  gets 
activated  in  gliomagenesis  is  unknown.  Based  on  our  preliminary  data,  we  hypothesize  that  various 
aberrations accumulating in the brain may converge on epigenetic alterations and reorganization of the three-­
dimensional structure of the miR-­10b locus, resulting in its transcriptional activation. Such structural changes, 
primarily mediated by the CCCTC-­binding factor (CTCF) and regulatory long non-­coding RNA transcripts, will 
result in the exposure of miR-­10b promoter to a corresponding enhancer, and thus miR-­10b expression. In 
this R01 project, we will test our hypothesis, investigate the epigenetic mechanism underlying the activation 
of miR-­10b locus in glioma, and establish the miR-­10b-­locus centered model of gliomagenesis. Specific Aim 
1  will,  therefore,  provide  the  high-­resolution  analysis  of  the  epigenetic  landscape  and  three-­dimensional 
chromatin  conformation  of  miR-­10b  locus  in  normal  neuroglial  and  glioma  cells  and  tissues,  and  at  the 
different stages of neoplastic transformation. It will also assess how generalizable such regulation is in glioma 
on a genomic scale. Specific Aim 2 will investigate functions of major regulatory DNA and RNA elements in 
the  locus,  including  the  promoter-­associated  and  enhancer-­associated  RNAs,  using  a  combination  of 
biochemical, gene editing, and imaging-­based approaches. Specific Aim 3 will model the process of the locus 
activation and neoplastic transformation of astrocytes and neuroprogenitors using cell and animal models of

Ebola virus disease (EVD) is caused by an infection with a group of viruses within the
genus Ebolavirus. There are at least five species of Ebolavirus, Ebola virus (Zaire,
EBOV), Ebola Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus and Tai Forest
virus (TAFV). Infections with these viruses can cause severe hemorrhagic fevers in
humans and nonhuman primates, and are associated with up to 90% mortality rates with
EBOV. Because of the safety concerns, these viruses are designated as the biosafety
level 4 agents. Currently there is no effective therapeutic treatments against Ebola virus
infection and pathogenesis in humans. Thus the goal of this application is to develop
GP-specific small molecule inhibitors as drugs which can be used prophylactically and
therapeutically against EBOV and other Ebola virus infections. To achieve this, we
screened an in-house library of small molecules, and identified numerous potent entry
inhibitors against EBOV. We have identified a series of potent compounds and will use
them as leads which will be chemically optimized and developed as an anti-Ebola virus
therapy candidate. In this application, two specific aims are proposed: (1) structure-
based optimization of the lead compounds, and (2) In vivo evaluation of the lead
compounds against EBOV infection using animal models."
10894026,"SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Unhealthy drinking is considered one of the top 10 public health concerns in the United States.1 Not only has
heavy drinking been linked to poorer overall health, it is responsible for about 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million
years of potential life lost in the United States each year.2 Men exposed to social disadvantage, such as Black
men living in poverty, are more likely to consume more alcohol.3–5 Indeed, in Arkansas, a state with high rates
of unhealthy drinking, Black men who make less than $35,000 are more likely to report heavy drinking
(4 or more drinks a day) and consume more drinks when binge drinking.6 Further, the negative impacts of
unhealthy drinking may be worse for Black men. Black men who report consuming large amounts of alcohol
often experience more severe health outcomes and more negative social consequences when compared to
other ethnic groups.7–11 Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an evidence-based,
multilevel, integrated, public health approach to the delivery of early intervention services for individuals at risk
for risky drinking, and the timely referral to more intensive treatment for those who have substance abuse
disorders.12–14 SBIRTs have been effectively implemented in both primary care and emergency care settings15.
However, structural barriers to care (i.e., insurance status, culturally competent services, racism and
discrimination, etc.) may impede Black men's access to evidence-based care for unhealthy drinking
located in medical settings.16 Given the increased risk for mortality and morbidity associated with unhealthy
drinking among Black men living in poverty, coupled with the more harmful health consequences of unhealthy
drinking for Black men, improving equitable access to evidence-based care by implementing care into community
settings that Black men are more likely to access is urgently needed.
Thus, the goals of this proposed Hybrid Type 2 pragmatic effectiveness-implementation trial are to: 1) test the
effectiveness of a previously developed, evidence-based SBIRT intervention (Barbershop Talk) for low income
African American men; and 2) generate the scientific evidence needed to disseminate SBIRTs to “real world”
settings. Data from this study will further our understanding on how to reduce the risk of alcohol attributable
morbidity and mortality among Black men living in poverty. Data will also improve our understanding of strategies
that can improve implementation of evidence-based care models in non-clinical settings; thus, extending the
reach of evidence-based care to communities with the highest need."

10894179,"This application proposes to continue a successful collaborative partnership between North
Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the UNC Alcohol Research Center (UNC ARC) in
response to RFA-AA-21-015. NCCU, founded in 1910, is a Historically Black College or
University (HBCU) that has partnered with the UNC ARC since 2010; this partnership
contributed to the enrollment of NCCU’s first PhD students in 2012 and to several of the current
10 PhD graduates. NCCU is a comprehensive institution offering bachelor’s degrees and
graduate degrees, with 80% of NCCU students being underrepresented minorities (African
American or Hispanic). NCCU is located near the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and
the UNC NIAAA Alcohol Research Center, which has been funded since 1997. The previous
UNC-NCCU partnership involved 10 NCCU biomedical faculty in alcohol research (about 30%
of NCCU faculty laboratories), with up to 15 students each year contributing to 37 publications
and three funded NIAAA R grant applications. None of this occurred prior to this partnership.
This U54 Administrative Core proposes to continue to build and promote alcohol research
expertise and to develop research infrastructure and capacity, particularly for health disparities-
associated pathology. Further, the Administrative Core will develop and administer collaborative
education-training of URM NCCU students in UNC ARC labs and other UNC training activities.
This will be accomplished through 5 aims: Aim 1: Provide scientific and administrative
leadership; Aim 2: Monitor and enhance collaborative partnerships; Aim 3: Mentor leadership
among faculty; Aim 4: Support the Scientific Mentoring and Research Experiences Core; and
Aim 5: Recruit NCCU laboratories to alcohol research. Through structured mentoring and
experimentation, this proposal will create successful alcohol research programs, leading to both
discoveries and the education of large numbers of URM students on health disparities
associated with alcohol use disorders."
10894180,"Scientific Mentoring and Research Experiences (SMRE) Core – Abstract: Representation of minority
groups in alcohol research and other academic careers is important, but there are significant disparities found in
academia1. Evidence suggests these disparities can be improved by structured mentoring that cultivates
interests, experiences, and skills of underrepresented minorities (URMs) in the sciences and fosters their
retention in academia1. The NCCU alcohol research laboratories in the current proposal were developed through
a previous funded partnership grant focused on developing independent alcohol investigators. A primary goal of
the current RFA is to promote the participation of URM scientists, and this new Scientific Mentoring and Research
Experiences Core (SMRE) directly addresses this goal. Importantly, this Core will also increase productivity for
each research component by mentoring NCCU students and supporting their expertise in complex scientific
methods. UNC ARC and NCCU collaborative partnerships have always involved undergraduate and graduate
URM students, but this proposal expands existing alcohol research collaborative partnerships with the additional
goal of increasing student matriculation into alcohol research programs. By providing tailored experiences and
infrastructure that enables student research success, we strengthen each component and facilitate student
interests into lifelong biomedical careers. This includes mentoring in complex scientific methods for alcohol
research projects, mentoring from multiple UNC ARC alcohol PIs, as well as professional development skills.
 RCMIs are strong teaching institutions, with students comprising the bulk of the research workforce.
Accordingly, in prior years of this partnership, we found that strengthening the alcohol research expertise of
NCCU students not only enhanced the pipeline of URM researchers, but it also improved the quality and
productivity of each research project. We now propose focused initiatives to strengthen the scientific expertise
of students in each research project. This includes mentoring in academic scholarship, scientific communication,
grantsmanship, scientific rigor, responsible conduct of research, and complex scientific methods tailored for each
scientific component. Increasing research skills and career coaching for NCCU students will promote student
interest and benefit research project productivity, increasing successful discoveries that will help develop
projects’ independent funding as well as increasing academic and biomedical workforce diversity. To accomplish
these goals, we propose to: (1) provide NCCU undergraduates with mentoring in complex scientific methods and
career development to improve scientific skills and promote entrance of URMs into alcohol research, (2) provide
NCCU graduate students within collaborating components focused mentoring and instruction in complex
methods tailored to each research component, and (3) facilitate laboratory mentors with evidence-based training
in mentorship of diverse populations. This Core will strengthen each component by providing resources to the
scientific development of the students on each component."
10894183,"Project Abstract: Excessive binge alcohol consumption causes major health and socio-economic issues within
the United States. Unfortunately, minorities in this country are disproportionately burdened by these problems
despite equal incidences of binge drinking. Finding ways to reduce binge like consumption therefore remains an
important field of research to combat health disparities and decrease the development of ethanol dependence.
This project seeks to determine if astrocytes and the neuroimmune system represent novel targets by which to
curb excessive consumption. This grant determines the influence of excessive ethanol on astrocytic activation
and function in the hippocampus as well if the proinflammatory cytokines are responsible for glial maladaptations
(Aim 1). Because sex-differences can alter neuroimmune responses, these studies will elucidate the impact of
sex on both astrocyte activation and their function. Secondly, these studies will determine if hippocampal
astrocytic signaling can be switched to reverse the influences of ethanol on the increased proinflammatory
microenvironment and decreased glutamatergic tone of the hippocampus (Aim 2). Finally, because both
glutamate and proinflammatory cytokines can impact hippocampal dependent memory tasks and consummatory
behaviors, these experiments will determine the impact of astrocytic signaling on ethanol consumption and
alcohol-induced cognitive deficits (Aim 2). The development of astrocyte specific DREADDs allows us to
manipulate G-protein coupled receptor signaling in the hippocampus using site directed stereotactic viral
delivery. Altogether, these two aims will test our overall hypothesis that there is a reciprocal and reinforcing
relationship between alcohol and astrocyte activation mediated by the influence of astrocytes on glutamatergic
tone and proinflammatory signaling cascades. These innovative studies will provide insight into the role of
astrocytes in the transition to alcohol dependence as well as the influence of alcohol-induced neuroimmune
dysregulation on the astrocytic response."

The objective of the proposed research is to target molecular pathways involved in alcohol-induced limb/fin
defects to identify novel mechanisms with a role in FASD with the long-term goals of informing clinical practice,
and ultimately reducing the incidence and severity of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD). This objective
will be met by applying two innovative and complementary approaches that use cell, zebrafish and mouse
models to (i) genetically knockout and identify genes that rescue or exacerbate the effects of ethanol exposure,
and (ii) high throughput screening of focused chemical libraries to identify compounds that modulate the effects
of ethanol exposure. Our approach utilizes genetically modified zebrafish and mice, and the developing fin and
limb respectively, as readily examined target tissues whose molecular signaling pathways and vulnerability to
ethanol teratogenesis are well documented. This research proposal is founded on 1) strong evidence that
craniofacial abnormalities and limb defects have been observed in those identified with FASD, 2) recognition
that disruption of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, a major morphogenic pathway regulating embryonic
development as a significant consequence of prenatal ethanol exposure (PAE), 3) that genetically reduced
Shh signaling results in increased vulnerability to ethanol-induced birth defects, and 4) the availability of
differentially expressed gene sets from our previous study on the effects of PAE on mouse limb development.
The hypothesis to be tested is that the identification of novel genes and compounds that can rescue
morphological and behavioral deficits elicited by PAE will reveal fundamental and novel insights into the
mechanism of ethanol-induced birth defects. This hypothesis will be tested with experiments that employ well-
established cell line, zebrafish, and mouse FASD models and will address the following Specific Aims: Aim 1
will use these in vivo and in vitro models to assess gene-environment interactions, particularly the candidate
genes whose expression was shown to be altered in ethanol-exposed mouse limb buds by our previous
ethanol RNA Seq study. Aim 2 is to utilize high-throughput screening technologies in vitro and in vivo to identify
small molecule modulators that rescue or exacerbate the effects of PAE. Small molecule compounds that
rescue or exacerbate ethanol-induced fin defects in zebrafish embryos and limbs defects in mice will be
identified. The proposed studies will be conducted by NCCU faculty and trainees under the mentorship of
UNC’s Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies researchers. In addition to expanding our understanding of ethanol’s
teratogenic mechanism of action as well as providing clues regarding genetic sensitivities and interventions for
FASD and potentially novel pathways with a role in FASD, this research project will foster state of the art
research by budding scientists from underrepresented minorities and will provide the foundation for important
FASD studies to be addressed in future grant applications/research."
10894187,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol consumption has been associated with increased breast cancer risk. Although alcohol-associated breast
carcinogenesis has been extensively studied, the mechanisms of alcohol-induced tumor initiation, especially the
primary cell targets in cancerous transformation, remains unclear. Recent advances indicate that deregulation
of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a small group of tumor cells with self-renewal and differentiation potential, plays a
central role in cancer initiation, development, and recurrence. The effects of alcohol consumption on breast
cancer stem cells have been poorly understood. Nevertheless, studies showed that alcohol-induced liver
oncogenesis involves CSC promotion. Alcohol-derived acetaldehyde (AA) induces chromosome rearrangement
with functional consequences in hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that tissue stem cells may be the primary
target of alcohol/AA-associated genotoxicity. Supported by our preliminary studies showing that alcohol induces
DNA damage, chromosome alterations and CSC expansion in breast cancer cell lines, this project aims to study
whether and how alcohol consumption promotes cancer initiation through induction of CSCs from mammary
stem cells (MaSCs). We hypothesize that alcohol promotes breast cancer development through AA-mediated
gene mutations and genomic instability of MaSCs, which leads to the disruption of genome integration and
cancerous transformation. The underlying mechanisms involve mutation of p53, impairment of DNA repair
machinery and deregulation of stemness networks. In support of this study, we have developed the MMTV-
erbB2/Aldh2-/- mouse model for mammary tumorigenesis and MaSC analysis. These unique tools will facilitate
our studies on AA accumulation-associated toxicity in MaSCs in vivo. The hypothesis will be tested in three
specific aims. 1) To determine whether alcohol and AA exposure promotes MaSC/CSC stemness and mammary
tumor development in treated animals. 2) To examine alcohol/AA-induced genomic instability in mammary
tumors and MaSCs/CSCs. 3) To understand the mechanisms of alcohol/AA-mediated genomic instability and
MaSC/CSC deregulation focusing on p53 pathway and Wnt/Sox2/RANKL signaling network of mammary
stemness. Results from this project will advance our understanding of alcohol-induced genomic injury and MaSC
mutation that lead to malignant transformation in breast cancer initiation, and identify specific regulators that
mediate these genetic and functional changes of the MaSCs and CSCs. These data will be of great significance
for early diagnosis and prevention of alcohol-associated breast cancer."
10894191,"ABSTRACT – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core’s responsibilities include overall leadership of MIDUS as well as oversight of data
collection, management, and delivery of research data. Leadership will be provided by the Principal
Investigator (PI) and Executive Steering Committee (ESC), consisting of the Leaders/Co-Leaders of the
Projects and Cores. They will oversee major decisions regarding implementation and completion of the stated
aims of the U19 and the Ancillary AD/ADRD U01 applications. Primary leadership tasks include: monitoring
progress in achieving funded objectives of the research; nurturing effective and synergistic communication
across Projects and Cores; organizing and hosting meetings among co-investigators, public users, and the
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC); insuring quality control in execution of the research; managing contractual
agreements, allocation of funds, and yearly reporting; and resolving disputes, when needed. Day-to-day
responsibilities are centrally managed by Admin Core Co-Leaders at UW-Madison, including coordination of
data collection across Projects. Four Projects are included in this U19 (Survey, Daily, Biomarker, Genomics)
and three Projects are included in the Ancillary AD/ADRD U01 (Cognitive, Affective Neuroscience, ADRD
Neuroscience). Data for all will be collected (over a 6-year period) that covers the next wave of the Refresher
(MR2) and the Core (M4) national samples as well as targeted African American samples from Milwaukee. The
Admin Core will oversee and field this complex task, which requires careful sequencing of recruitment from
Project to Project, combined with timely communication among Project-specific investigators. Such goals will
be accomplished through an innovative online Administrative Core database system that manages respondent
assignment, participation, and contact information across Projects in real-time. The Admin Core will also create
and deliver to the research community high quality datasets with comprehensive, user-friendly documentation.
These goals will be advanced via metadata conventions and use of cutting-edge technology supported by a
research documentation standard called the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI). Building off these efforts, the
Admin Core will continue to enhance a one-of-a-kind online Portal that aids users with intelligent search
functions, harmonization tools, and custom data extracts, thereby supporting the longitudinal and
biopsychosocial integrative objectives of MIDUS. Sensitive data (such as from Genomics and Neuroscience
Projects) will be made available via restricted access procedures and repositories managed by the Admin
Core. Admin Core Co-Leaders will facilitate public use of MIDUS datasets via presentations and webinars that
describe how to access and work with the NACDA and Portal data. Finally, the Admin Core will oversee and
manage linkages to external data resources to MIDUS, such as regular mortality updates, Medicare records,
geo-coding, medication usage, and occupational descriptors of MIDUS participants."
10894192,"ABSTRACT – BIOCORE
To obtain the full panel of biomarkers in the MIDUS project, collection and analytic efforts must be coordinated.
The BioCore (B) thus fulfills an essential role in MIDUS by providing centralized, reliable testing, processing,
and storage of biospecimens (i.e., hematological, endocrine, inflammatory, metabolic, bone turnover,
antioxidant, gene expression). All tests are performed by single laboratories to ensure consistent results over
time. Core B also assists in the standardization of protocols (i.e., identical collection and processing SOPs) and
monitors shipment integrity and testing at the analytic laboratories over time (i.e., Quality Control). Core B also
has the primary responsibility for storing aliquots from new samples and maintaining a complete set of archival
specimens in ultracold freezers. In addition to overseeing all testing, the BioCore conducts assays and
transports the samples that are tested at local clinical labs in Madison, WI. A centralized Core operation is
essential to ensure uniform entry of test results into a single record system. One corollary of this administrative
function is reviewing the reliability of data entry before transmission of results for dissemination and combining
with demographic/psychosocial data. Core B also has several advisory and pedagogical functions, which
includes providing “norms” for test results, meeting with investigators to advise on analyses, and conducting
educational workshops on the use and meaning of biological measures at MIDUS meetings. The future
performance of the BioCore will be facilitated by the extensive experience gained during the prior MIDUS
periods. The panel of biomarkers going forward is similar to the panels employed previously with some new
additions. The BioCore has previously assisted in establishing new methodologies (e.g., multi-cytokine arrays,
an assay of HDL anti-oxidant activity) and will also oversee new analyte testing related to risk for Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) linked with the Ancillary U01 application. To highlight the BioCore’s
level of experience, over 100,000 specimens have been tested in the prior periods. Processing of blood and/or
cells for gene expression is also routine for Dr. Coe’s (PI, BioCore) laboratory. Dr. Coe has over 3 decades of
prior experience with endocrine and immune assays, including with many body fluids, different assay platforms
and cell separation protocols. In sum, Core B provides the infrastructure and required resources to ensure high
quality and reliable biomarker assessments in MIDUS."
10894163,"Project Summary
Ribosome and proteomic profiling have revealed a large number of small translated open reading frames (ORF)
within previously described “untranslated regions” (UTRs) and long non-coding RNAs. While some of the small
ORFs depend on the encoded peptide to function in various fundamental processes (e.g., development).
Translation of small ORFs in the 5’UTR, known as upstream-ORFs (uORFs), usually represses gene expression,
independent of the encoded peptide. Small ORFs have also been reported in 3'UTR, termed downstream ORF
(dORF). However, the dORF function and their relationship to human health and disease remain unknown.
I characterized dORFs from human and zebrafish using ribosome profiling data. My preliminary data indicates,
contrary to uORFs, translation of dORFs (small ORF in the 3’UTR) strongly enhances translation of the
canonical ORFs and remains an uncharacterized regulatory mechanism across vertebrates. The
objectives are: 1) Dissect at the single molecular level how dORF enhances translation of the canonical CDS.
And 2) Determine whether alternative polyadenylation in cancer influences dORF regulation to cause cancer.
The rationale for the proposed research is to gain a mechanistic understanding of dORF-mediated regulation
and to assess the possible biological importance of dORF dysregulation under disease conditions (e.g. Cancer).
This proposal is conceptually innovative as it is based on the exploration of a novel, yet widespread translation
regulatory mechanism conserved across vertebrates. Technically, this proposal will combine single molecular
imaging, genomic profiles (RNA-seq, Ribosome profiling), and reporter approaches in different human cell lines
(including cancer cells) and published patient data.
The outcomes from this project will emphasize the role of ribosome as a master gene expression regulator, and
shield light on the importance of small ORFs. This translation kinetics work about dORF will provide critical
insights into the molecular mechanism of this uncharacterized regulatory pathway. Exploring dORF dysregulation
in cancer due to APA will highlight the mRNA itself as disease driver even without any mutation in DNA, and it
also indicates possible clinical impact of dORF to detect and even cure cancer.
My long-term interest is to study gene expression dysregulation in cancer. This training award will increase my
knowledge background of cancer biology, molecular biology and bioinformatics. It will also promote the technical
training of single molecular imaging, ribosome profiling, cell biology assays for cancer. Overall, this proposal will
help me for future independent cancer molecular/genomic career."
10928804,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Impulsive choices involve trade-offs between amount and delay by delivering smaller-sooner (SS) versus
larger-later (LL) rewards. Impulsive choices occur when individuals frequently choose the SS when it is
suboptimal to do so. Impulsive choices have been identified as a trans-disease process due to their
association with a wide range of diseases and disorders including substance abuse, gambling, obesity,
and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Impulsive choice can be both a pre-cursor to and product of
maladaptive behaviors. The overarching goal of our research program is to identify the underlying
mechanisms of impulsive choices and target those mechanisms using interventions to promote self-control. Time discrimination deficits and delay intolerance predicted stable individual differences in
impulsive choice in the rat pre-clinical model. Poor timing and delay intolerance are purported
endophenotypes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, providing important links with the rodent pre-clinical model. Time-based interventions have successfully moderated impulsive choices and improved
time discrimination in rodents. Time-based interventions were most successful in promoting self-control
in the most impulsive individuals. Most importantly, interventions that involved active waiting and that
required time discrimination were most effective, suggesting a causal role for timing processes in the
time-based interventions. Based on the previous results, the timing dysfunction model (TDM) proposes
that impulsive choices arise from distorted timing processes, which may result in imprecise or inaccurate
timing. Dysfunctional timing processes can lead to impulsive choices. Thus, the TDM proposes that
timing processes are a primary candidate for therapeutic interventions. In addition, different
neurobiological mechanisms may be responsible for the different contributions of specific timing
processes to impulsive choices. Aim 1 will demonstrate distinct roles for specific timing processes in
promoting self-control. This aim will confirm the TDM and pinpoint the mechanisms of time-based
intervention effects on impulsive choices for future neuroscientific and translational research. Aim 2 will
assess effects of the interventions on structural connectivity in cortico-striatal pathways, which are prime
candidates for the time-based intervention effects on timing and impulsive choices. This aim will use
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to measure structural connectivity. Aim 3 will use Designer Receptors
Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to depress activity in neurobiological pathways that
are likely candidates for the time-based intervention effects. The three aims will identify specific cognitive
and neural mechanisms of time-based interventions. This research is significant due the critical need for
effective interventions to moderate impulsive choices. As a trans-disease process, impulsive choice has
broad relevance for human health and is of significant relevance to the NIMH mission."

 The Ten-Eleven Translocation (Tet1/2/3) family of enzymes promote DNA demethylation and are highly
expressed in neural stem cells (NSCs). They catalyze the stepwise oxidization of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC). These modified
cytosines are removed by thymine DNA glycosylases (TDG) to promote active demethylation. They also interfere
with recruitment of Dnmt1 during replication thereby promoting passive DNA demethylation. 5hmC is stable and
abundant in various cell types, particularly in the nervous system, which suggests that not all DNA hydroxylation
leads to demethylation. By uncoupling Tet-mediated DNA hydroxylation from formylation and carboxylation, we
may elucidate novel functions of these enzymatic processes in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in
NSC biology. We hypothesize that Tet-mediated DNA hydroxylation vs. formylation/ carboxylation contribute
uniquely to gene regulation and biology in NSCs. To dissect these dual catalytic functions, we have introduced
a mutation in all three Tet genes in ESCs that abrogates Tet’s ability to formylate and carboxylate, which we call
Tet1/2/3 Formylation/Carboxylation (FoCa) mutant (Tet-FoCam/m) ESCs. This line can generate 5hmC but not
5fC and 5caC in contrast to our Tet1/2/3 full catalytic mutant ESCs (Tet-Catm/m) ESCs that lack all oxidative
activities. We will differentiate these lines to NSCs to: (1) establish the biological requirements of Tet-mediated
DNA hydroxylation vs formylation/carboxylation in the self-renewal and multipotency of NSCs, and (2) define
how Tet-mediated DNA hydroxylation vs formylation/carboxylation regulate neural genes critical for NSC biology.
Findings from these studies will establish the individual contributions of Tet-mediated DNA hydroxylation vs
formylation/carboxylation and uncover the significance of 5hmC, 5fC, and 5caC in NSC gene regulation and
biology. Under the joint mentorship of Drs. Meelad Dawlaty and Bernice Morrow, I will successfully complete the
proposed research and training plan. This research program will enhance my knowledge of stem cell biology
and facilitate my scientific and professional development by equipping me with the necessary skills to become a
physician-scientist."

 Two million Americans are hospitalized for sepsis each year, and 1 in 3 die. Those that survive, however,
are not cured. Neurocognitive disorders occur in up to 50%, and cognitive decline continues for up to 8 years.
Sepsis hospitalizations account for a higher proportion of unplanned readmissions than those for myocardial
infarction, heart failure, and COPD. Five-year mortality for sepsis survivors exceeds that for heart failure and
stroke. The mechanisms underlying this persistent loss of health remain to be defined. We hypothesize that
early during sepsis the mitochondrion is restructured as an adaptive mechanism to protect the cell against any
future environmental stress, such as recurrent sepsis. These structural changes impart lasting alterations to
the mitochondrial calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis and metabolism necessary to support a cellular phenotype,
which for a multicellular organism are poorly tolerated and underlie a persistent loss of health.
Our lab has spent nearly two decades studying sepsis to elucidate the Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that
regulate mitochondrial biology to balance Ca2+ homeostasis and ATP generation and preserve cellular health.
We have shown that early after sepsis, mitochondrial depolarization generates a Ca2+ signal. Members of the
family of Ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) transduce these Ca2+ signals and work in
tandem to mediate adaptive changes in mitochondrial fission, mitophagy, and oxidative metabolism to lessen
cellular damage. More recently, we observed that sepsis restructures the mitochondrial calcium uniporter
(MCU) complex, imposing long-lasting changes to mitochondrial and cellular Ca2+ homeostasis and
metabolism that perturb cellular and tissue function across the entire organism. We propose that as a
‘learned’ response to sepsis, the cell restructures the MCU complex to counter the potential for Ca2+
overload with future insult; this imparts long-lasting alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis, oxidative
metabolism, and tissue phenotype. Using models of lower-respiratory tract and intraperitoneal infection and
correlative human samples, we propose the following aims:
Aim 1. To study in mice and humans how a restructured MCU complex alters Ca2+ homeostasis and
oxidative metabolism and thereby, the phenotype of each tissue comprising the organism.
Aim 2. To define the mechanisms of mitophagy and protein degradation through the lysosome and
proteasome as underlying causes of the persistent loss of MICU1 expression in murine models of
sepsis and in human sepsis survivors.
This new experimental work will provide foundational knowledge as to how the mechanisms governing
mitochondrial Ca2+ and metabolism are restructured during sepsis to underlie a persistent loss of cellular
phenotype that leads to a progressive loss of health and shortened survival."

This project aims to address the significant problem of bacterial pneumonia in goats,
which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality and represents a significant welfare
challenge for operations in the United States. Currently, there is only one FDA-approved
antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory disease in goats, which requires daily
administration. That decreases efficacy in situations where owner compliance with
labeled instructions is lacking. To address this problem, the proposed research aims to
validate an analytical method for the detection and quantification of tulathromycin
residues in caprine liver and conduct a freezer stability study of tulathromycin in caprine
liver. The expected outcome is to have a validated LC-MS analytical method for the
detection and quantification of tulathromycin residues in caprine liver that will be used
for completion of the HFS technical section and future studies to determine
tulathromycin residue depletion. The label approval of Draxxin® 25 will make it easier
for veterinarians to use tulathromycin in goats with confidence in scientifically based
labeled slaughter withdrawal times."

Human herpesviruses can cause congenital birth defects in neonates and a wide range of disease in humans,
with particularly devastating effects in immunocompromised individuals. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and other cancers, with high prevalence in sub-
Saharan Africa. There is no cure for any herpesvirus; most existing antivirals target a single viral process and
can lead to resistance mutations. The recent development of a herpesviral packaging inhibitor highlights the
viral genome packaging machinery as an attractive target for novel antivirals. The herpesviral packaging
machinery is conceptually similar to that of bacteriophages, yet it has additional complexities that include
factors of unknown function. In this proposal, I outline my vision to understand the molecular mechanism of
herpesvirus packaging. I will determine the function of an essential factor in herpesvirus packaging that has
long evaded mechanistic dissection using state-of-the-art proteomics and microscopy approaches. I will also
develop a new strategy to apply deep mutational scanning approaches to herpesviral proteins. In parallel, I will
determine the structure of the KSHV terminase, the viral molecular motor that packages the viral genome into
the nascent capsid. I will then reconstitute the essential components of the KSHV packaging machinery and
use these to develop an in vitro packaging assay. This assay will be leveraged to screen for new antivirals and
determine the molecular underpinnings of existing drugs that target the packaging machinery. The proposed
studies will build a foundation to address long-standing, fundamental questions in DNA virus packaging and
understand the mechanism of anti-herpesvirals."

10898841,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous, usually benign virus. Nevertheless, HCMV frequently contributes to rejection of organs in transplant patients and causes systemic disease and defects in the development of the CNS in neonates. HCMV infects many different cell types including epithelial and endothelial, glial cells, fibroblasts and monocyte-macrophages. This broad tropism is facilitated by a capacity to enter different cell types via distinct entry pathways involving different viral glycoproteins including: gH/gL/UL128-131, denoted the pentamer, gH/gL/gO, the trimer. Our model for how HCMV enters epithelial and endothelial cells suggests that HCMV trimers bind to cell surface receptors, e.g. PDGFRα viruses are internalized and pentamer acts in endosomes to promote gB-mediated fusion in fibroblasts, then of the virion envelope with cellular membranes. There is a third form of gH/gL, a complex of gH/gL with gB, gB-gH/gL and we do not know whether gB-gH/gL promotes in virus entry. Given their importance in virus entry, trimer and pentamer are also important targets of antibodies (Abs) and are considered key players in the design of HCMV vaccines. Four aims are proposed: Aim 1. To characterize pathways of HCMV entry into fibroblasts and epithelial and endothelial cells and determine where trimer and pentamer function. This aim will test the hypothesis that trimer binding to cellular receptors leads to cell surface traffic followed by internalization of virus particles into cells and downstream pentamer-mediated effects promoting virus exit from endosomes into the cytoplasm. Aim 2. To determine the structures of trimer and trimer:PDGFRα, define trimer structure/function relationships and identify other trimer receptors. We have a preliminary structure of trimer with its receptor PDGFR We will extend these structural studies and use site directed mutants to test function. Other studies will identify trimer receptors important for entry into epithelial and endothelial cells. Aim 3. To investigate how HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes function. We will test the hypothesis that gB- gH/gL is important for HCMV entry by using mutant forms of gB and gH/gL to block assembly of gB-gH/gL. Aim 4. To characterize trimer- specific Abs in human sera and compare to pentamer Abs. We made striking observations that trimer- and pentamer-specific Abs in human sera synergize to neutralize HCMV. We will extend these studies characterize the prevalence and potency of trimer-specific Abs and identify the epitopes in trimer recognized by these Ab."

Neuroscience research and training have seen tremendous growth in recent years. Of note, this
progress has extended into the study of psychiatric disorders, which has increased our knowledge
around the neurobiology and mechanisms underlying drug use and addiction. Nonetheless, this
growth has not translated into training opportunities for historically marginalized groups, including
ethnic minorities, people from economically disadvantaged groups and people with disabilities.
These disparities in training, mentoring and education are particularly concerning for the study of
addiction, as the harms related to drug use and addiction disproportionally affect minority and
underserved communities. Thus, it remains critically important that our mentoring of the next
generation of neuroscientists is reflective of all the diverse groups in our society. We recognize
that research experience is not only a key factor in bolstering awareness and interest in
neuroscience careers, but also in the admittance and successful completion of neuroscience PhD
programs. Furthermore, we believe that the historic underrepresentation of marginalized groups
in neuroscience stems, in part, from a lack of research opportunities in these groups during their
undergraduate education. Thus, the primary objective of the University of Washington Substantial
Opportunities in Addiction Research (UW-SOAR) Doctoral Readiness Program is to close this
gap of training by providing diverse groups with a mentored research experience in a world-class
neuroscience laboratory in the UW NAPE (Neurobiology of Addiction, Pain and Emotion) Center.
This experience will be coupled to unique educational and professional development opportunities
to facilitate their recruitment and success in neuroscience doctoral programs. To achieve this
goal, our program aims to 1) increase representation across multiple dimensions of difference
(race, ethnicity, gender, sex, geography, ability, etc.) among postbaccalaureate researchers to
improve the quality and diversity of science, 2) advance the matriculation and retention of diverse
groups of trainees in Neuroscience PhD programs, and 3) determine the effectiveness of the
SOAR program through an evaluation process."

Mitochondria are double-membrane bound organelles that perform many crucial cellular functions, including
nucleotide and amino acid metabolism, cellular phospholipid and ion homeostasis, and their most notorious
function, generation of cellular energy via oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial form and function are tightly
linked. The ability of the organelle to efficiently perform respiration depends on the correct spatial organization
of the mitochondrial inner membrane into elaborately shaped morphological domains, including cristae, the
hallmark of the organelle. Cristae morphology defects lead to reduced cellular respiration and is a phenotypic
consequence of a number of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s Disease. Despite their importance, we have minimal mechanistic understanding of how cristae are
formed and organized within the organelle. Recently, the Mitochondrial Contact Site and Cristae Organizing
System (MICOS) complex was identified as a master regulator of spatial organization of mitochondria. I
previously determined that MICOS is organized into two non-redundant subcomplexes that independently
assemble and localize to cristae junctions, a key structural element of the mitochondrial inner membrane.
Despite our progress, we have minimal mechanistic understanding of how MICOS contributes to the number,
position, and morphogenesis of cristae membranes. In the next five years, our goal is to address these deficits
by exploring the molecular basis of MICOS function in yeast cells and, using candidate and forward genetic
strategies, determine how MICOS is regulated to fine tune cristae architecture in human cells. This work will
lead to insight into the spatial organization of mitochondria and the form-function relationship of the organelle,
provide the basis for the future development of my research program, and give us molecular insight into the
disorganization of mitochondrial membranes that occurs as a consequence of a number of human diseases."
10898657,"Project Summary / Abstract
The potential of precision medicine to benefit the lives of cancer patients continues to emerge. The mission of
the Chinnaiyan lab is to advance the field of precision oncology, and we aim to achieve this through the discovery
and development of molecular targets that will aid in diagnosis, prognosis, or therapeutic intervention of cancers.
Over the past several years, we have made a number of significant advancements in these areas. One of these
landmark studies found that TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions exist in the majority of prostate cancers. This discovery
led to our development of a non-invasive clinical test (Mi-Prostate Score, MiPS) that combines analysis of urine
levels of TMPRSS2-ERG and the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PCA3 with serum levels of PSA to detect
prostate cancers. Due to its subsequently established roles in prostate cancer pathogenesis, we also reported
on the development of peptidomimetic inhibitors (ERG inhibitory peptides, EIPs) of the ERG gene fusion product.
A monumental achievement in the field of precision oncology has also been establishment of our comprehensive
sequencing program for advanced cancer patients, called Mi-Oncoseq. Mi-Oncoseq has become a model for
integrative clinical sequencing and generated several pivotal findings, including our recent report on the
integrative sequencing analysis of metastatic cancers. Data from our sequencing program were also included in
our report of the lncRNA landscape of the human transcriptome. Studies of individual lncRNAs have additionally
emerged in our lab, such as validation of SChLAP1 as a marker for aggressive prostate cancer.
This brief description of selected achievements highlights our commitment to advancing precision oncology and
our vast foundational experience in this arena. Through the NCI Outstanding Investigator Award, we propose to
continue these lines of research to further explore the diagnostic potential of precision oncology, therapeutic
targeting of identified markers, and roles of nominated targets in cancer development. The future research
program centered on diagnostic potential will include such initiatives as creation of new bioinformatic resources
(e.g. “Mi-PANDA”, a compendia of transcriptomic data), high throughput single cell sequencing analysis of
patient samples, and creation of cancer-specific lncRNA panels for use with non-invasive clinical isolates.
Therapeutic targeting will be explored through the use of antisense oligos to lncRNAs and studies on the efficacy
of peptidomimetics for gene fusions and “undruggable” targets. These avenues of research will provide impetus
for studying the roles of selected noteworthy targets in cancer development. In particular, we have already
discovered two lncRNAs, ARlnc1 and THOR1, which appear to be involved in cancer progression. Overall, this
ambitious research program will advance the field of precision oncology by providing new community resources,
identifying novel biomarkers, exploring the therapeutic targeting of nominated molecular players, and adding to
the knowledge-base of cancer development mechanisms, particularly those of lncRNAs. Importantly, this award
and the proposed work would assist our lab in its mission to remain a leader in the field of precision oncology."

Early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are critical for delaying the onset of clinical symptoms,
such as cognitive impairments and memory deficits. Early in AD, cognitively normal individuals who are positive
for amyloid-β, a predictive biomarker of AD, exhibit a transient increase in brain connectivity prior to a decline in
brain connectivity and cognition. This hyper-connectivity phase of AD suggests a prodromal pathology that may
be exploited as an early biomarker prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Though these changes in brain
network connectivity have been well documented, little is known about the underlying neuropathology. I seek to
test whether localized increases in excitatory neuronal activity caused by amyloid-β drive the brain-wide hyper-
connectivity observed in early AD. I will use a multimodal imaging approach to determine the impact of amyloid-
β on neuronal and glutamate activity on the scale of the neuron (microscopic), regional neuronal circuit
(mesoscopic), and inter-regional network connectivity (macroscopic) in mouse models of AD. My proposal
comprises the following three aims: Aim 1: Determine the impact of acute exposure of amyloid-β on neuronal,
glutamate, and network activity in the normal cortex, Aim 2: Determine the impact of chronic, progressive
amyloid-β accumulation on neuronal, glutamate, and network activity in a young mouse model of AD, and Aim
3: Determine how total glutamate concentration changes, measured by translational magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, relate to synaptic glutamate activity changes with disease progression. Together, these
experiments could determine the neurophysiological underpinnings of the connectivity changes observed in early
AD. Data from this study could introduce novel treatment strategies for patients at risk of developing AD.
Furthermore, this work closely integrates my clinical interest in neuroimaging and neurology. In addition to
rigorous mentored research training, this proposal includes clinical experience and professional development
that will facilitate my growth into an independent physician-scientist."
10898697,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Leading to over 270,000 deaths in the US annually, septicemia is the systemic inflammatory response to a
bloodstream infection (BSI). Timely diagnosis and treatment of BSIs has been demonstrated to improve patient
outcomes and reduce hospitalization time. However, currently accepted diagnostic approaches still require
primary blood cultures, which are not only slow, requiring ~1-3 days, but also demonstrate reduced sensitivity
in the presence of antimicrobial treatment. There is thus a significant need for new diagnostic approaches that
do not require cultures and provide faster, more accurate results.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID (Resistance and Pathogen IDentification), a fully
automated, sample-to-answer platform appropriate for placement throughout the hospital. RaPID consists of a
bench-top Analyzer operating single-use cassettes capable of identifying and characterizing complex invasive
infections directly from patient specimens, without cultures. Being culture-free, RaPID tests are not inhibited by
polymicrobial infections nor prior antimicrobial treatment. The first test implemented on this platform,
RaPID/BSI, incorporates a broad test menu of 21 bacterial and fungal pathogens with single CFUs/ml sensitivity
within roughly 3 hours. Over multiple clinical studies the test has demonstrated >94% sensitivity and >99%
specificity relative to culture across the test menu. Owing to the product’s advantages over exiting alternatives
and its potential to improve care, the FDA designated RaPID/BSI a Breakthrough Technology in 2020.
HelixBind has recently completed proof-of-concept studies of a reflex test to complement RaPID/BSI which
targets the most common and clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes found in BSIs. This test, RaPID/R,
has not only demonstrated single CFUs/ml sensitivity across the panel of resistance genes, but also the ability to
properly characterize multiple drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms. A manual version of the has been used to
successfully detect resistance in clinical samples. In this proposed Phase II project, HelixBind will translate the
test to the automated RaPID platform. Studies demonstrating analytical sensitivity and specificity will be
completed as will a blinded clinical assessment of RaPID/R. These studies will ensure that product performance
matches specifications and clinical requirements. In parallel, study designs for product verification and
validation will be completed and submitted to the FDA as part of a Pre-Submission process.
To succeed in this project, we have assembled an accomplished team with expertise in assay development,
instrumentation, consumables manufacturing, regulatory compliance, clinical microbiology, and infectious
disease. This team has a successful track record of commercializing FDA-cleared IVD platforms and assays.
Together, we will build upon our preliminary work to complete product development. Upon completion of this
project, we will be well placed to initiate formal Analytical and Clinical studies required for FDA clearance."

Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (InSTI), such as dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC), have high
antiviral potency against HIV-1, excellent safety and tolerability, and a high barrier to resistance. It is a high
priority to promote the availability and rational use of InSTI in adults and children with HIV, including
those with tuberculosis (TB). South Africa has the highest rates of HIV and TB co-infection in the world--
among patients with TB, 50-80% have HIV. Rifampicin (RIF), an essential first-line TB drug, is a potent inducer
of metabolizing enzymes and transporters, causing drug interactions that limit HIV-TB co-treatment options. In
adults, DTG, now recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO) as the preferred first-line antiretroviral
for the treatment of HIV-1, can be given together with TB treatment, provided the dose is doubled (to 50 mg
twice daily) to mitigate the drug interaction. While DTG dosing has now been established for children down to a
weight of 20kg, no data exist to guide dosing for young children with TB on RIF-containing treatment. BIC, co-
formulated with emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide (BIC/FTC/TAF, Biktarvy®) was recently shown to be
non-inferior to DTG-based treatment, with no emergence of resistance in Phase 3 trials. However, no data

80% with RIF (but remained 3-fold higher that the protein adjusted effective concentration (paEC95). In another

To determine the PK and safety of DTG 50mg twice daily in children (20-35kg) who are taking a RIF-containing
regimen for the treatment of TB. The proposed studies are timely and will generate knowledge needed to
support evidence-based use of InSTI in adults and children with HIV-associated TB who are taking RIF-

no data to support the safety and efficacy of Biktarvy® twice daily for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in
patients with TB on RIF co-treatment and it is unlikely that this potent, safe drug with a high genetic barrier to
resistance, that may provide effective future ART treatment options, will be made available in Africa if it cannot
be used in patients with TB. Thirdly, there are no published data to support dose recommendations for DTG
among children receiving TB treatment (particularly in the proposed weight-band). HIV-TB co-treatment options
are extremely limited in children, making this an area of critical unmet medical need."

among children receiving TB treatment (particularly in the proposed weight-band). HIV-TB co-treatment options
are extremely limited in children, making this an area of critical unmet medical need."
10901125,"Project Summary/Abstract
Acute infection of mice with Toxoplasma gondii results in a collapse of the regulatory T cell (Treg)
population. While the infection-induced collapse of Treg cells has been defined, the re-building of
the compartment and the long-term impact of the crash have not been studied. Tregs were
originally believed to be a monolithic population of suppressor cells, but there is recognition of
distinct subsets termed central and effector Tregs. At homeostasis, central Tregs (cTregs) are a
relatively quiescent subset whereas effector Tregs (eTregs) exhibit hallmarks of recent TCR
engagement and potent suppressive activity. The studies presented here reveal that infection
results in a skewing of the composition of the Treg compartment after the collapse. My data shows
as infection resolves, there is restoration of IL-2 production and thymic output and the Treg
compartment returns to near normal levels, yet there remains a marked increase in the ratio of
cTreg:eTreg cells. The use of lineage tracing shows that the post-crash Treg compartment is
dominated by Treg cells that were present during collapse but a population of newly-generated
Tregs emerge from the thymus These observations raise fundamental questions about the
rebuilding process: (1) What cytokines contribute to re-population? (2) Does ongoing inflammation
associated with chronic infection affect Treg output and phenotype? And (3) Does the Treg
collapse lead to permanent alterations to the population structure or function of the Treg
compartment? To get at these questions, I will utilize high-parameter flow cytometry, multi-omic
sequencing and an in vivo Treg tracing model to investigate the Treg compartment throughout
infection with T.gondii. I will interrogate the impact of IL-2 and IL-7 on Treg re-population and
determine how infection shapes the re-built Treg compartment. These studies will enhance our
understanding of Treg biology during infection and identify possible approaches for manipulating
Treg subsets therapeutically."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic age-associated disease with a median survival of 3-5 years
following diagnosis. Current antifibrotic treatments, pirfenidone and nintedanib, slow the progression of IPF but
are insufficient in halting or reversing this disease. While the etiology remains unknown, fibroblast-mediated
extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling leading to the development of fibroblastic foci appears to be a critical
component of IPF. The objective of this project is to engineer an in vitro 3D pulmonary microtissue model
to explore the contribution of age-associated pathways to fibroblast-mediated ECM remodeling. My
previous work generating microtissues supports the feasibility of developing this in vitro 3D pulmonary
microtissue model. Additionally, microtissues have been previously used to study cell-matrix interactions
including in the context of fibrosis. A main advantage of using the microtissues system to study fibrotic diseases
is the ability to assess real-time changes in contractility and cell migration in a medium throughput system. My
central hypothesis is that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and the development of
an apoptosis-resistant phenotype in senescent fibroblasts contribute to ECM remodeling in IPF. The
overall objective and hypothesis will be accomplished across three specific aims: 1) Engineer pulmonary
microtissues using human fibroblasts isolated from IPF and healthy tissues of various ages; 2) Evaluate the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype of IPF fibroblasts and determine its effects on microtissue
remodeling; and 3) Assess the development of an apoptosis-resistant phenotype in senescent cells and evaluate
the role of FAK in regulating apoptosis. Expected outcomes for this project include: 1) An in vitro pulmonary
microtissue model capable of detecting differences in microtissue contractility, stiffness, cell migration, and ECM
remodeling; 2) Determining the impacts of SASP on ECM remodeling and evaluating the therapeutic benefit of
targeting specific components of SASP; and 3) Assessing FAK’s role in preventing apoptosis in senescent cells
and evaluate the therapeutic benefit of FAK inhibition. The results of this study will elucidate the role of
fibroblast senescence in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis and identify potential
druggable targets."
10904612,"Despite a strong evidence-base for the efficacy of asthma care programs in reducing asthma morbidity among
low-income minority children, little progress has been made implementing and sustaining interventions in at–risk
communities. Effective interventions require a multi-level approach and reducing asthma disparities requires
engaging community stakeholders in implementing and sustaining systems of care that reach high-risk children.
Schools are an ideal location for reaching children given the strong connection to families and trust from
communities. Our multi-disciplinary asthma health disparities collaborative group has a long and successful
history of developing and evaluating multi-level community based interventions for asthma management tailored
for urban pediatric populations. We have established a strong partnership with Baltimore City Public schools and
Health Department to identify potential contributors to poor asthma control. The long-term goal is to implement
an evidence-based asthma intervention based on the CDC recommended framework (EXHALE) within Baltimore
City Schools. To provide the foundation for success, we will seek to identify and engage local key stakeholders,
conduct a community needs assessment to inform necessary refinement and adaptations of the interventions,
and build on strong partnerships with collaborative strategies to ensure successful implementation of an asthma
intervention program. Results for this multi-phase project will inform the implementation of a tailored
multi-level asthma intervention program (Asthma CHAMPS: Community and Home Asthma Management
Program in Schools). Implementation of the Asthma CHAMPS Program will be evaluated in a pragmatic trial
applying a stepped-wedge design among 32 elementary schools in Baltimore City. The conduct of this project
has high potential to demonstrate a successful program that reduces asthma morbidity among Baltimore City
children as well as effective implementation strategies for urban communities."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been referred to as the “signature injury” of recent military combat operations
in Iraq and Afghanistan. The form of TBI that is most prevalent among military service members and Veterans
is repetitive, mild TBI, or rmTBI. Apart from the immediate effects of a head injury, rmTBI is also associated
with a number of significant and chronic co-morbid conditions including cognitive dysfunction, sleep disorders,
alterations in visual function, and psychiatric complications (e.g., depression, suicide, anxiety). rmTBI and its
co-morbid conditions exact a steep toll on military personnel and Veterans and the cost to the nation of TBI is
estimated to be $60 billion annually. The mechanisms by which rmTBI alters brain function are not well
understood and all clinical trials of new therapies for TBI thus far have failed. Therefore, an effective treatment
for TBI does not exist. Perhaps the most alarming aspect of rmTBI is the possibility that repeated mild impacts
to the head do not cause clinically significant or recognizable symptoms but set in motion a cascade which has
an endpoint of neurodegeneration and psychiatric illness. The primary goals of this application are to 1) refine
and validate a humanized mouse model of rmTBI and 2) test two new mechanism-based therapies for the
long-term consequences of rmTBI. These goals will be achieved by employing a new model of rmTBI that is
very mild, even after as many as 20 head impacts, and which does not result in any behavioral or neuronal
pathology at the end of the treatment period. We include preliminary data showing that rmTBI results in a
delayed and progressive emergence of increased reactive gliosis and inflammation along white matter tracts,
and increases in the pathologic form of tau, a microtubule stabilizing molecule. In addition, this model of rmTBI
results in slowly developing cognitive deficits and psychiatric-like disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression),
neither of which are evident immediately after the rmTBI course of treatment. These neuronal and behavioral
outcomes are hallmark signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and have been observed in
postmortem brains of military service members exposed to rmTBI. Two new drugs will be tested as therapies
for rmTBI and include an inhibitor of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor
(CSFR1) inhibitor that ablates CNS microglia. The rationale behind the use of an HDAC6 inhibitor for treating
rmTBI is compelling for several reasons. First, modification of tau by acetylation protects it from aggregation
(i.e., its pathological form) by inhibiting its phosphorylation. Second, HDAC6 has been identified as the specific
enzyme that deacetylates tau. Deacetylation of tau allows for modification of tau by phosphorylation. Third,
inhibition of HDAC6 should shift the balance of acetylation/phosphorylation to favor acetylation and thereby
protect tau against pathological aggregation in brain. The rationale behind the use of a CSF1R inhibitor is
likewise compelling and strong because rmTBI results in significant increases in microglial activation which
then causes a secondary activation of astrocytes. This increased glial reactivity results in neuronal damage. By
ablating microglia, a CSF1R inhibitor should prevent activation of both microglia and astrocytes and reduce the
CTE-like damage that occurs in CTE. The effects of rmTBI will be studied over a chronic time-frame in mice to
simulate the slow-developing neuropathologies and behavioral disorders seen in humans after repeated head
injuries. Treatment will not begin until after exposure of mice to repetitive head impacts in order to simulate a
clinical situation more closely. It is hypothesized that inhibition of HDAC6 or CSF1R after rmTBI will prevent or
reduce the development of CTE-like tau pathology. It is hypothesized further that prevention of the formation of
tauopathies with these treatments will reduce the chronic co-morbid conditions that develop with high
frequency after rmTBI to include cognitive dysfunction, alterations in vision and sleep, and depression- and
anxiety-like behavioral disorders. This project has high translational relevance for the VA health care mission."

In the cerebral cortex, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons are the major source of inhibition.
Interneuron dysfunction is strongly associated with autism and childhood epilepsy. We demonstrated that
environmental influences such as electrical activity are fundamental for the maturation of GABAergic circuits.
However, the identity of the activity patterns controlling interneuron development remains poorly understood.
The long-term goal of this research is to uncover how early interneuron dysfunction leads to lasting
neuropathologies. The objective of this proposal is to reveal the signaling pathways underlying activity-
dependent development and to assess how perturbations in this process lead to aberrant brain function.
To this end, we will use the murine barrel cortex as a well-established model for the study of activity-dependent
circuit maturation. We will focus our studies in superficial circuits since our previous work indicates that these
circuits are exquisitely sensitive to environmental perturbations in the neonate. In the near term, this proposal
is aimed at investigating the role of specific interneuron subtypes in regulating the emergence of long range
connectivity (Aim 1). In addition, this project will determine the role of GABAergic inputs for the functional
maturation of pyramidal networks. We will study the role of Gabrb3, a gene encoding for the beta3 subunit of
GABAA channel. Mutations in this gene are strongly associated with Angelman syndrome and ASD (Aim 2).
Finally, we will assess how developmental defects in early GABAergic signaling lead to abnormal brain activity
in cortico-cortical pathways during development (Aim 3).
With respect to the outcomes, our work is expected to identify basic mechanisms fundamental for the
emergency of a healthy E/I balance. In addition, these results are expected to have a significant translational
impact because they will expand our mechanistic knowledge on how mutations in the GABRB3 gene may lead
to behavioral abnormalities frequently observed in ASD patients."
10905007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The translation of research from the bedside to real-world practice utilizing disciplines including disease
epidemiology, biostatistics, comparative effectiveness research, evidence synthesis, decision modeling, quality
improvement, and implementation science is essential to improve the health of populations. The NIH, FDA
and other organizations have increasingly recognized the importance of this broader sense of translational
research. However, the pool of clinician investigators trained to perform such research is limited, particularly in
the fields encompassed by the mission of the NIDDK. Training in these disciplines requires the same rigor as
traditional “wet-bench” research; and undergraduate exposure and training in public health and epidemiology
are relatively uncommon, leading to a significant underrepresentation of these fields in graduate training. This
shortage of qualified clinical investigators is particularly evident among women and underrepresented
minorities, a key focus of the 2021 NIDDK Strategic Plan for Research.
 To address these needs, in 2017 we established the Undergraduate Clinical Scholars Program (UCSP), an
innovative undergraduate research opportunity (URO) at the University of Pennsylvania. The specific aims of
the UCSP are two-fold: Aim1. To foster a strong interest among talented undergraduates in human
clinical research with a focus on digestive, pancreatic, liver, kidney, and diabetes research; and Aim 2.
To establish durable mentoring relationships between talented undergraduates interested in pursuing
clinical research and supportive faculty mentors. The cornerstone of the UCSP is an intensive clinical-
research experience that entails close interaction with and mentorship by a UCSP faculty member. UCSP
students also complete a structured curriculum in epidemiology and biostatistics that is enhanced with a
statistics laboratory and lectures/discussion groups in ethics, scientific writing and pathways to medical school
admissions (MD and combined degree programs). The in person program culminates with a formal research
symposium where students present and defend their work. The UCSP infrastructure provides administrative
support to help sustain the mentorship relations after the summer program. The highly competitive program
receives approximately 500 applicants per year. To date, we have had 28 UCSP students including 13
underrepresented minorities and 15 women. Students have been involved in 13 peer-reviewed publications,
received a number of honors including 2 Marshall Scholarships, and 8 students are currently in medical school
with another 8 applying this year. In aggregate, this innovative URO has successfully provided superb faculty,
exceptional scientific resources and exciting intellectual environment for trainees to be exposed to and expand
their knowledge and interest in clinical and health services research with a key outcome to motivate trainees in
clinical research careers with a focus on digestive, pancreatic, liver, kidney and endocrine related research."
10894731,"Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes severe disease in humans, with fatality rates reaching
40%. CCHFV is endemic to parts of Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, specifically to regions where the
tick vector, species of the Hyalomma genus, is present. Classified as an NIH/NIAID Category A and WHO high-
priority pathogen, CCHFV poses the highest possible risk to national security and public health. CCHFV is a
negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus in the order Bunyavirales. CCHFV is an Emerging Infectious Disease,
posing a high risk of a widespread outbreak. An inactivated whole virus vaccine was the only CCHFV vaccine to
be tested in humans and was ineffective. We propose the use of inactivated rabies virus (RABV)- and vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV)-based CCHFV vaccines, as inactivated rhabdoviral vectors have not yet been explored.
Inactivated rhabdoviral-based vaccines are safe and effective at inducing immunity and protection against
multiple hemorrhagic fever viruses, and a VSV-based surrogate challenge virus is an effective tool in another
hemorrhagic fever model. The goal of this project is two-fold: first, to compare RABV- and VSV-based
CCHFV/RABV bivalent vaccines in terms of their production, immunogenicity; second, to establish a non-BSL-4
VSV-based surrogate mouse challenge system for CCHFV to determine mechanism of protection.
 We hypothesize that inactivated rhabdoviral-based CCHFV vaccines will protect against the
CCHFV challenge through non-neutralizing antibodies directed against GP38.
Toward this hypothesis, we propose three Aims:
 Aim 1: Characterization of Rhabdoviral-based CCHFV vaccine constructs.
This aim does characterize and test the immunogenicity of RABV- and VSV-based CCHFV vaccines and
compare them to the Bulgaria human vaccine and an mRNA-based vaccine provided by collaborators.
 Aim 2: Determine rhabdoviral-based CCHFV vaccine mechanism of protection by establishing a
surrogate challenge virus model.
This aim aims to develop a non-BSL-4-requiring surrogate challenge model for CCHFV and compare it to the
established BSL-4 WT CCHFV model in vaccine efficacy studies.
 Aim 3: Evaluate the protective efficacy of rhabdoviral-based vaccine candidates in a wildtype
CCHFV lethal challenge model using needle and tick challenge.
The goal of this aim is to determine the efficacy of our rhabdoviral-based vaccines and control vaccines against
WT CCHFV challenge in two different lethal challenge model."

Abdominal cancers are a devastating cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. For example, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) has a grim five-year survival rate of less than 20% and is the fastest rising cause of cancer-
related deaths in the U.S. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial, as curative treatment is feasible by surgical
resection and/or focal ablation. Compared to surgery, focal ablation reduces hospital stay, increases
preservation of surrounding normal tissues, and decreases treatment-related morbidities. However, focal
ablation still faces critical limitations in applicability and effectiveness due to inadequate image guidance and
procedural accuracy provided by current approaches. Consequently, there is a pressing need to establish new
minimally invasive interventions to improve the diagnosis and treatment of abdominal cancers.
Conventional abdominal interventions rely on image guidance by ultrasound and/or computed tomography (CT),
which can fail to provide sufficient visualization of the cancerous lesions. In addition, CT utilizes ionizing radiation
and cannot be used for real-time imaging throughout an intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has
crucial advantages that make it ideal for real-time guidance of abdominal interventions: it is the best and/or only way
to visualize HCC and several types of abdominal cancers, has no ionizing radiation, and has the potential for real-
time imaging of abdominal organs that are constantly in motion. However, current real-time MRI suffers from
compromises in image quality, time latency, and difficulties in tracking the devices and tissue targets during
motion. Furthermore, the narrow physical space of MRI scanners severely impedes the physician’s access to the
patient inside the scanner during imaging. As a result, current MRI-guided interventions require cumbersome
workflows that hamper the accuracy and efficiency.
The objective of this proposal is to overcome these challenges and enable real-time MRI-guided abdominal
interventions. The interdisciplinary research team will leverage synergistic innovations in (1) real-time MRI and
computer-aided guidance methods, (2) MRI-compatible robotics, and (3) computer-aided feedback control
methods and interactive user interfaces to create a new real-time MRI-guided robotic system. The system will
be evaluated in programmable dynamic tissue phantoms and in vivo pig liver models to achieve safe, accurate,
and efficient needle placement in moving targets – the foundation for all abdominal interventions. This new
robotic system will enable next-generation real-time MRI-guided interventions that can positively impact the
diagnosis and treatment of patients with liver tumors and abdominal cancers."

The study of cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) has shaped our view of innate immunity, and led
to the clinical translation of therapies for CAPS and other NLRP3-dependent inflammatory diseases. Our
preliminary in vivo genetic data now suggest that the assumed central role of monocytes and macrophages in
CAPS may be overstated. Rather, the neutrophil lineage alone can drive lethal autoinflammation in CAPS
neonatal mice, and this is indistinguishable from systemic NLRP3 activation. The molecular regulation of NLRP3
inflammasome activation is distinct in neutrophils compared to macrophages, so this research will study
biochemical regulation of NLRP3 activation in mouse and human cells of the neutrophil and monocyte lineages.
We will investigate cells from patients with CAPS, and from mouse models with activating NLRP3 mutations
expressed specifically in neutrophils (Nlrp3PMN mice). Neutrophil precursors are elevated in successfully-treated
CAPS patients and in Nlrp3PMN mice, suggesting developmental abnormalities of neutrophils in Nlrp3PMN mice,
or a reduced threshold for pyroptosis induction in the neutrophil lineage - hypotheses that will be formally tested
in this study. Single cell Western and RNA-Seq data from purified neutrophil precursor populations have revealed
constitutive IL-1b expression in neutrophil progenitors and immature neutrophils in healthy mice, suggesting that
these precursors, but not mature neutrophils, are the dominant source of IL-1b in organs of CAPS patients. We
now hypothesize that this developmentally-regulated expression of pro-IL-1b enables neutrophil
precursors with NLRP3 activating mutations to release processed IL-1b independent of signal 1 or signal
2. We also hypothesize that the absence of mature neutrophils from all organs and tissues of neutrophil-
specific CAPS mice is a consequence of pyroptosis. This project seeks to define: (a) the differences in organ
pathology and morbidity of mice with monocyte- or neutrophil-specific NLRP3 activation; (b) the cell-intrinsic
effects of NLRP3 activation on neutrophil differentiation and lifespan; and (c) the sensitivity of cells of the
neutrophil lineage in CAPS patients and neonatal CAPS mice to canonical and non-canonical activators of the
inflammasome and pyroptosis; Our specific aims are therefore to: (1) compare organ involvement and morbidity
of mice with monocyte-specific and neutrophil-specific activation of NLRP3; (2) understand why mature
neutrophils are absent in neonates of neutrophil-specific CAPS mice; and (3) investigate inflammasome
activation and pyroptosis induction in neutrophil lineage cells from patients diagnosed with CAPS. Identification
of the key cell types causing disease in CAPS will help us to understand the development of other NLRP3-driven
inflammatory diseases, and may also improve disease management and highlight novel biomarkers for
autoinflammation."

 This is a T32 training grant from the University of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (KU
ADRC) to train the next generation of researchers in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The
KU ADRC was funded in 2011 and is one of 33 national research centers with unique thematic expertise in
mitochondria / bioenergetics, lifestyle modification, and AD prevention research. The KU ADRC research base
has grown dramatically in the last decade and there is now a clear need to grow its research training programs
to accelerate the research efforts and create the next generation of ADRD researchers.
 The proposed T32 program will provide multidisciplinary, translational ADRD research training for 2
predoctoral, 2 postdoctoral, and 4 summer students. Program faculty include 23 Primary Preceptors who are
uniquely qualified to support full-time (pre- and postdoctoral trainees) and summer trainees and 19 Short-Term
Preceptors who are eligible to support summer students. The 42 faculty come from 18 departments and
include basic, translational, and clinical investigators who all have a history of collaboration with each other and
the ADRC. We have a large and growing pool of training grant eligible trainees who are attracted by the
diverse and growing portfolio of NIH funded research.
 Our training approach includes a dual mentorship plan (i.e., basic and clinical mentors) for full-time trainees
that is structured as an Individual Development Plan to encourage multidisciplinary and translational
approaches. The program is designed to provide the skills needed to develop an independent research career
in ADRD research through 4 objectives: 1) provide a broad ADRD foundation with exposure to diverse
research approaches (basic, clinical, and translational) and clinical care (patients and caregivers), 2) develop
ADRD research skills (basic, clinical, and translational), 3) develop multidisciplinary research skills to foster
collaborations among trainees and mentors, and 4) develop presentation and grant-writing skills. The summer
training program is designed to expose clinical students to ADRD research and clinical care to foster interest in
careers in ADRD research.
 The training program leverages institutional resources and the KU ADRC's research strengths to create a
developmental pathway for the next generation of ADRD basic, translational, and clinical scientists. T32
funding will provide critical support to synergize with ongoing institutional efforts, further enhance the ADRC's
training efforts, and draw on the center's unique resources, exceptional mentors, supportive collaborators, and
growing breadth of educational opportunities."
10894799,"My long-term goal is to integrate health informatics, data mining and machine learning to improve the care for
patients with, and at risk for, acute kidney injury (AKI). I am dual trained in Nephrology and Critical Care
Medicine. I am already developing my skills in health informatics. This proposal presents a five-year career
development plan for NIH K08 award focused on training in advanced data mining, machine learning and their
applications to critical care nephrology. To that effect, I have assembled a strong mentoring team with decades
of experience in mentoring, research and leadership. The outlined career development plan in conjunction with
intensive mentoring and hands-on training will provide me the perfect platform to become a leading
independent investigator in the field.
AKI is seen in over one-third of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Several trials investigating various
medications to prevent or treat AKI over the last two decades have proven futile. Management of AKI therefore
focuses on its prevention, measures to reduce further progression and management of its complications. The
strategy to prevent AKI and its progression relies on clinical interventions to optimize a patient’s fluid status,
blood pressure and avoiding nephrotoxins and hyperglycemia. These clinical interventions when provided to
patients requiring cardiac surgery as a care-bundle are associated with decreased incidence of AKI. This care-
bundle, however, has very low compliance with implementation and lacks the ability to personalize care for
patients. With prior work showing differential response to therapy in AKI phenotypes, there is a critical need to
determine personalized strategies to prevent the development of persistent AKI. Personalization of treatment
strategies based on dynamic clinical characteristics of patients will ensure that the right action is performed at
the right time. As transient AKI resolves spontaneously within 48 hours, focusing interventions to those at high
risk for developing persistent AKI will lead to further personalization of this approach. The overall objective of
this project is to determine a personalized strategy using machine learning to prevent the development of
persistent AKI after cardiac surgery. I will pursue following specific aims for this study: (1) Develop
reinforcement learning (RL) based strategy to prevent the development of persistent AKI after cardiac surgery.
(2) Develop digital biomarkers to predict patients at risk for persistent AKI after cardiac surgery. Completion of
these aims will provide a structured framework to provide personalized care to prevent the development of
persistent AKI after cardiac surgery. It will also provide me with preliminary data and experience necessary to
apply for R01 applications as an independent investigator leading a data science research program in critical
care nephrology."
10894800,"Project Summary
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor with poor prognosis. GBM contains heterogeneous
cancer cells including glioma stem cells (GSCs) and harbors abundant tumor-associated macrophages
(TAMs). Because the majority of TAMs are tumor-promoting macrophages (pTAMs, M2) that support malignant
growth and augment immune suppression, reprograming pTAMs into tumor-suppressive TAMs (sTAMs, M1) to
activate macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. As pTAMs
actively interact with GSCs to promote tumor growth and therapeutic resistance, redirecting pTAMs into sTAMs
may synergize with targeting GSCs to suppress GBM growth. To discover small molecules that can reprogram
pTAMs into sTAMs to stimulate macrophage phagocytosis of glioma cells, we designed a phagocytosis
fluorescent screening assay, using GFP-labeled human iPSC-derived macrophages and tdTomato-expressing
glioma cells including GSCs to identify drug candidates and the potential molecular targets. To this end, we
identified several inhibitors of BACE1 (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) as top candidates,
and thus defined BACE1 as a molecular target to redirect pTAMs into sTAMs. Our studies demonstrated that
BACE1 is preferentially expressed by pTAMs in human GBMs and required for maintaining pTAM polarization.
Inhibiting BACE1 by its inhibitor MK-8931 potently reprogramed pTAMs into sTAMs and promoted macrophage
phagocytosis of glioma cells to suppress GBM growth. Moreover, we found that low-dose radiation (IR)
markedly enhanced TAM infiltration into GBM and synergized with MK-8931 treatment. As MK-8931, initially
developed for Alzheimer's disease, has been shown to be safe for patients in clinical trials, MK-8931 can be
potentially streamlined for the macrophage-based tumor therapy. In addition, we previously found that the non-
receptor tyrosine kinase BMX maintains GSC tumorigenic potential by mediating STAT3 hyper-activation, and
demonstrated that targeting BMX with ibrutinib potently suppressed GBM growth and impaired radioresistance.
Because both ibrutinib and MK-8931 penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or the blood-tumor barrier (BTB)
very well, repurposing ibrutinib and MK-8931 for GBM treatment should be straightforward and have promising
potential. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that redirecting pTAMs into sTAMs by MK-9831
synergizes with targeting GSCs by ibrutinib to suppress malignant growth and thus improves GBM
treatment. We will accomplish our objectives through the following Aims: (1) We will assess the effect of
reprograming pTAMs into sTAMs on cytokine profile, GSCs, and GSC-derived pericytes in GBM; and (2) We
will evaluate the therapeutic impact of reprograming pTAMs to sTAMs and targeting GSCs for GBM treatment.
The outcomes from the proposed pre-clinical studies will determine whether synergistically reprograming TAMs
and targeting GSCs can serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to effectively improve GBM treatment, which will
inform future clinical trials."

Candidate: My long-term career goal is to develop a successful academic career and become an independently
funded physician-scientist focused on the study of innate immunity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Under
the guidance of my mentor and research advisors, I have received training in laboratory-based assays, in vitro
models of IPF, translational medicine, and biostatistics. I have proposed career development activities that will
allow me to continue this training, but also develop unique expertise that is distinct from my mentor in the areas
of (1) innate immunity and (2) computational biology. Mentors and Environment: I will be mentored by Dr. Erica
Herzog, a globally renowned IPF investigator who has studied the immunopathogensis of fibrosis with an
extremely impressive track record of successful mentees. My advisors include Dr. Naftali Kaminski, a well-known
IPF investigator whose visionary methods in the genomic profiling of fibrotic lung disease have revolutionized
the field; Dr. Wajahat Mehal, who has been lauded for his work with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Toll-Like
Receptor 9 (TLR9) in the development of fibrosis; Dr. Min-Jong Kang, an expert in mitochondrial innate immunity
in chronic lung disease; and Dr. Anjelica Gonzalez, who has developed novel methods in bioengineering for ex
vivo modeling of the fibrotic microenvironment. My department Chair (Dr. Gary Desir) has assured me that at
least 75% of my time will be dedicated to my career development, and he and my Section Chief (Dr. Kaminski)
have detailed their commitment. Mentored Research Project: The pathogenesis of IPF involves the
uncontrolled accumulation of activated myofibroblasts, which arise in response to TGFβ1 mediated interactions
with the stiff fibrotic lung microenvironment. The innate immune receptor TLR9, which recognizes and responds
to mtDNA derived from injured cells, has been shown to have a significant role in mediating this process. We
showed that mtDNA is released by TGFβ1-stimulated and stiffness-induced normal human lung fibroblasts,
where it induces myofibroblast transformation in a manner that phenocopies fibroblasts harvested from the IPF
lung. In the clinical setting, mtDNA concentrations are elevated in the plasma of IPF subjects, where it displays
a robust association with all-cause mortality in two independent cohorts. Our subsequent studies reveal that
mice deficient in TLR9 are protected from fibrosis caused by lung specific overexpression of the bioactive form
of the human TGFβ1 gene and by repetitive administration of low-dose inhaled bleomycin. While exciting,
however, these studies are limited by not having determined whether mtDNA-induced fibroblast activation
requires TLR9, whether TLR9’s fibrosis promoting effects are mediated through fibroblasts in vivo, and the nature
of the mtDNA-TLR9 relationship in IPF. Because elucidation of these questions might substantially impact our
understanding of pulmonary fibrosis, this K08 application proposes a state-of-the-art set of translational studies
to test the hypothesis that mtDNA-TLR9 interaction drives fibroblast activation and fibrosis in the adult lung."
10894946,"MIDAS: Microangiopathy, endothelial Damage in Adults undergoing Stem cell transplantation
ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic cell transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HCT-TMA) is a clinical diagnosis based
on consensus criteria and associated with high mortality rates (80%). Approximately 9,000 hematopoietic cell
transplant (HCT) procedures are performed in the U.S. annually, and reported frequencies of HCT-TMA are
highly variable due to lack of routine screening. HCT-TMA is a morbid and potentially life-threatening
complication of HCT including microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal dysfunction and neurological
symptoms. The initiating event of HCT-TMA appears to be endothelial injury, and extensive data indicate decline
in endothelial health as people age suggesting that HCT-TMA might be more frequent or severe in older persons.
Preliminary data indicate a bimodal distribution of HCT-TMA in adults, with a peak early after transplantation,
which is well described in children, but a second later peak 3-6 months after transplant, sometimes associated
with a flare of graft versus host disease (GVHD) during taper of immune suppression. There is no reported
prospective study of HCT-TMA in adults thus risk factors and outcomes are currently unknown. This is a key gap
in current knowledge and we plan to address this gap in our proposal. The need for a prospective adult cohort
study of HCT-TMA is urgent as older patients are increasingly eligible for HCT. This study will define clinical
phenotypes, risk factors, and possible therapeutic strategies for HCT-TMA. Our overarching hypothesis is that
“The etiology and risk factors for HCT-TMA are different in adults than children, and that these differences
importantly modify potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies”. We propose to identify strategies that will
define HCT recipients with increased susceptibility to HCT-TMA occurring early after transplantation, and later
after establishment of GVHD. Identifying endothelial injury occurring post-HCT at the earliest possible time will
allow for prompt clinical intervention and interruption of the cycle of endothelial injury and complement activation.
The centers participating in this study are ideal for this work because they are large transplant centers with a
strong track record of successful clinical research and study enrollment with a long-standing interest in HCT-
TMA, evidenced by previous publications in the area. We will use our prospectively generated, well-annotated
clinical database to test hypotheses regarding pathophysiology, for example, that GVHD is a major contributor
to HCT-TMA by examining clinical risk factors and biomarkers of endothelial injury. We will measure the financial
cost of HCT-TMA, late organ toxicity and will formulate and test a predictive index for HCT-TMA to target
monitoring and treatment to highest-risk individuals. In summary, this study will provide essential data to identify
persons at highest risk of HCT-TMA to allow testing of future clinical interventions such as studies of endothelial
protecting agents and complement or interferon inhibitors for HCT-TMA and development of evidence-based
guidelines for screening and diagnosis of HCT-TMA in adults."
10894816,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Liver cancer ranks fifth in frequency and third in mortality, with estimated numbers of over 700,000 new
cases every year worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer that
originates from viral infection (e.g., hepatitis B, C) or injury-driven chronic inflammation (e.g., cirrhosis from
excessive alcohol consumption or obesity-induced steatohepatitis) in the liver. Although HBV and HCV incidence
are on the decline, the obesity epidemic has resulted in an increase in the number of new cases of HCC in
developed countries including the US. Thus, identifying targetable mediators of HCC represents an important
unmet medical need.
 Interleukin (IL)-27 is a cytokine that plays immunomodulatory roles in infection and autoimmunity. IL27R
signaling reduces inflammation in infectious and inflammatory models ostensibly by suppressing a pro-
inflammatory immune response. These findings led us to speculate that IL27 might function similarly to limit liver
inflammation and halt HCC development. Surprisingly, however, we have discovered that eliminating IL27R
signaling suppresses tumor development in two in vivo mouse models of HCC which was accompanied by the
increased accumulation and activation of innate and adaptive cytotoxic immune cells, suggesting a new, pro-
tumorigenic role for this otherwise anti-inflammatory cytokine.
 Here we propose to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms of how IL27R signaling suppresses
anti-cancer cytotoxic immune response using highly relevant to human HCC MUP-uPA mouse model combined
with cell type specific ablation of IL27R and integrated array of cutting-edge transcriptomics, histological,
immunological, and molecular biology analyses. Finally, we will test the efficacy and identify cellular and
molecular mechanisms of IL27 signaling blockade either alone or in combination with other immunotherapies,
as a new therapeutic avenue for HCC.
 Overall, the proposed research will uncover the role of IL27R signaling in HCC development and
determine the beneficial mechanisms of its blockade. This work has strong translational potential with game-
changing ramifications for HCC."
10894818,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Kawasaki Disease (KD) is the leading cause of acquired heart disease in children in developed nations. KD
can result in coronary artery aneurysms that can lead to lifelong heart disease, myocardial infarction, and
death. The clinical and epidemiologic features support an infectious etiology in genetically susceptible children,
but the cause has eluded more than 50 years of study. Delayed and missed diagnoses increase the risk of
coronary artery aneurysms. The development of urgently needed diagnostic tests and improved therapies are
dependent upon identifying the etiology. In preliminary studies, we analyzed the peripheral blood plasmablast
response at 1-3 weeks after KD fever onset using single cell RT-PCR and made 60 monoclonal antibodies
(Mab) from these plasmablasts. We used these Mab to determine their target antigens. We found that 32/60
Mab, derived from 9/11 KD patients, identify intracytoplasmic virus-like inclusion bodies (ICI) in ciliated
bronchial epithelium of KD children but not infant controls. Using peptide arrays to identify binding epitope(s),
amino acid substitution arrays, and ELISA, we found that 5 of the 32 (16%) Mab, derived from 3 KD patients
with coronary artery aneurysms, recognize KD peptide epitope 1. KD peptide 1 completely blocks binding of
these Mab to KD ICI, indicating that a protein with the binding epitope sequence is present in the ICI.
Moreover, pre-treatment sera from 5/8 KD patients >day 8 after fever onset but 0/17 infant control sera have
IgG antibody to the peptide epitope. We recently identified two additional epitopes using this approach that
require further study. These findings support our hypothesis that at least a subset of KD cases results from
infection with a presently unidentified, ubiquitous viral causative agent containing the KD peptide epitope 1
sequence. In this proposal, we hypothesize that identification of antigens targeted by the plasmablast response
to KD can lead to identification of the etiology(ies) and development of KD serologic tests. To test these
hypotheses, we will: 1) identify the specific proteins recognized by our panel of KD Mab that bind to KD
tissues, 2) screen for additional antigenic targets recognized by the immune response to KD, and 3) evaluate
the antibody responses of KD and control sera to KD antigens. Our findings will inform pathogenesis of KD,
with the long-term goals of improving diagnosis and treatment of KD, enabling prevention, and reducing
healthcare costs from the long-term consequences of coronary artery aneurysms arising in young childhood."
10895422,"Diagnostic & Laboratory Core (Core D)
To administer disease- and patient-specific care, accurate and rapid diagnosis of pediatric cancer is critical.
The core includes the clinical laboratories in Uganda and Malawi, which will provide histological review,
immunohistochemistry (IHC), and flow cytometry for prospective patients. Laboratory testing to monitor
patients (CBCs, chemistry) will also be performed in these laboratories, as required for clinical care.
Enhancements will be made to test the feasibility of using standardized diagnostic algorithms across multiple
sites and implementing virtual pathology for central review, in preparation for a larger LMIC network in Africa.
Centralized pathology review, especially for difficult to diagnose cases, is imperative for large-scale projects,
such as those proposed by the Consortium. Due to lack of access to immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
cytohistological review, misclassification of NHLs is common in SSA. This is even more critical in the HIV
setting where the clinical and pathology characteristics of NHL are atypical e.g. high-grade B-cell NHL
intermediate between DLBCL and BL are thought to be more prevalent. Further, non-cutaneous cases of
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) can be difficult to diagnose. The pathology services offered by this Core, and the
improvements made to the algorithm over the course of the funding period, will greatly enhance the ability to
more precisely diagnosis pediatric cancer diagnosis in the LMICs.
The core will also provide oversight of sample processing, storage, and shipping for the research studies
included in the proposal. In our experience, centralized processing of biospecimens ensures that they are
processed according to appropriate standardized protocols, which minimizes unwanted variability when the
samples are later analyzed. The responsibilities of the Diagnostic & Laboratory Core (Core D) include
support for the processing of all biospecimens generated from the Projects and for implementing
improvements in the pediatric cancer diagnosis algorithm at the SSA sites
To accomplish these objectives, the Aims of the Diagnostic & Laboratory Core are:
 1. To assist with the appropriate collection, processing, storage, and shipping of all biospecimens
 2. To perform routine histologic review, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry of pediatric cancer
 cases for clinical diagnosis and laboratory testing for the ongoing monitoring of patients
 3. To support the implementation, training, and coordination of central pathology review utilizing a virtual
 pathology network
 4. To implement enhancements to clinical diagnostic algorithms by supporting onsite validation and
 training on additional methodologies

10895424,"Project 1: Epidemiology of and Risk Prediction for Childhood Cancers in the Context of HIV/AIDS in
Africa
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) disproportionately bears the burden of pediatric HIV/AIDS, having approximately
90% of the 1.7 million pediatric cases of HIV. While substantial progress has been made in recent years to
limit the number of new cases of HIV among children, there are still an estimated 1.6 million children living with
HIV in SSA. These HIV-infected children are at a higher risk for developing cancer as a result of their disease.
The epidemiology of HIV-related malignancies among adults has been fairly extensively studied; however, few
epidemiologic studies on cancer among children with HIV have been conducted. Our long-term goal is to
determine which HIV-infected children are at highest risk of developing a malignancy. To address these gaps
in the epidemiology of pediatric HIV-related malignancies in SSA, we propose the following aims:
1. Calculate the prevalence and incidence of cancers among HIV+ children by expanding and updating
a cohort of HIV+ children who are treated and followed at the BIPAI Centers of Excellence.
We will leverage both the high-quality electronic medical record system in the BIPAI CoE and affiliated clinic
network and the large population of HIV-infected children who have been treated at the CoEs since 2004 to
understand the distribution of cancers in this high-risk population. Hypotheses: 1) The incidence of certain
infection-related cancers will be higher among HIV-infected children age 14 years or younger, and 2) there will
be a lower incidence of HIV-associated cancers (e.g., KS) over the timeframe of this cohort compared to
historical data, while the incidence of other non-AIDS defining cancers will be higher.
2. Determine the impact of clinical risk factors on pediatric HIV-related malignancy risk in SSA.
We will assess the impact of risk factors such as timing of anti-retroviral treatment, HIV stage at cancer
diagnosis, severe acute malnutrition at cancer diagnosis, and geoclimatic differences on HIV-related
malignancy risk of children living in SSA. We will also assess whether risk of developing HIV-related
malignancies is influenced by history of infections and other co-morbidities. Hypothesis: Factors related to a
child's HIV infection severity and early life environment underlie risk of developing pediatric HIV-related
malignancies in SSA.
3. Identify plasma biomarkers that are more abundant among HIV+ children diagnosed with cancer.
Based on evidence from the literature and our own preliminary data, we will compare a standard set of
cytokines/chemokines, and markers of virus burden, in 4 groups of children: 1) HIV+/Cancer+, 2) HIV+/Cancer-,
3) HIV-/Cancer+, and 4) HIV-/Cancer-. The goal is to identify biomarkers of cancer risk in HIV+ children that
could be utilized with the clinical factors identified in Aim 2 to develop a novel paradigm for cancer screening in
this high-risk population. Hypothesis: There are both specific cancer- and HIV-related differences detectable
in the plasma of children who develop HIV-related malignancies compared to those who do not."
10895425,"Project 2: Improving the Accuracy of Diagnosis of Cancer in Children with HIV Infection
The goal of Project 2 is to evaluate and implement novel strategies that are reproducible and sustainable
across treatment sites in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) to improve real-time diagnosis of HIV-associated pediatric
cancers, because this is a prerequisite for evidence-based treatment and clinical/translational research.
Diagnosis of cancer in children in SSA is a major challenge because of scarcity of local skilled personnel,
facilities for obtaining tissue biopsies, and laboratory platforms for pathology analysis. The result is that for
many children with suspected cancer a diagnosis is made based on clinical features only. If a biopsy is
obtained, morphological examination using Hematoxylin & Eosin (H&E) stain is often the only test performed.
In our study of 324 with HIV infection and diagnosed with KS at BIPAI centers in Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania
and Botswana from 2008 – 2014, 141 (43%) of the children were diagnosed based on clinical history and
examination only. The overarching aim of this project is to implement and evaluate harmonized diagnostic
strategies in PARCA sites.
Aim 1: Evaluate the adequacy of biopsies and diagnostic accuracy of the current Global HOPE Uganda
diagnostic strategy for pediatric cancer tumors. We will retrospectively assess the proportion of adequate
biopsies, and repeat or escalation to open surgical biopsy among 400 children with HIV-associated cancers.
To determine the accuracy of the current diagnostic strategy, we will perform gold-standard diagnostic assays
by United States standards on archived FFPE tissues from these 400 cases.
Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of standardizing the diagnostic algorithm across multiple sites by
implementing a similar algorithm in Malawi. We will implement a similar diagnostic approach in Malawi by
training medical personnel to use a similar biopsy strategy and expanding the flow cytometry and IHC antibody
panels to mimic those performed in Uganda. To ensure accuracy and consistency across sites in preparation
for implementation of standardized cancer treatment and research protocols across SSA sites, we will
implement a virtual pathology platform to enable sharing and central review of images. The virtual pathology
network will also serve as a platform for ongoing training of pediatric pathologists and technicians.
Aim 3: Improve accuracy of cancer diagnosis at SSA sites by designing, testing, and implementing
novel diagnostic methods. We will test and validate novel molecular assays of established diagnostic
biomarkers to improve timeliness and specificity of the diagnosis using platforms and procedures that are
sustainable in the SSA setting. Consideration will be given to cost, complexity, and turnaround time."
10895426,"PROJECT 3: Establishing a Platform for Clinical Improvement for Children with HIV-Associated
Malignancies in Sub-Saharan Africa
Outcomes for children with cancer in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are unacceptably poor, with fewer than 20% of
those diagnosed surviving. By contrast, over 85% of children with cancer in the United States survive. The HIV
epidemic complicates the landscape of pediatric malignancies in SSA. In SSA, there has been an emphatic
association between HIV infection and Kaposi sarcoma (KS), with a 40-fold increase in KS incidence in children
in Uganda. And although less pronounced, associations between HIV and mature B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(MB-NHL) have been established throughout the region. Not only has HIV impacted the frequency of cancer in
SSA, children with HIV have inferior outcomes compared to their HIV-uninfected contemporaries. Over the past
fifteen years, there has been a concerted effort to enable treatment of HIV-infected children in SSA with
antiretroviral therapy (ART). In partnership with collaborators in SSA, Global HOPE aims to lay the foundation
for an international collaborative clinical trial network: Pediatric HIV/AIDS & Infection-Related Malignancies
Research Consortium for Sub-Saharan Africa (PARCA). The central problem faced in SSA is the significant
burden of HIV-associated malignancies in children and the poor survival of these patients. The overall goal of
this project is to establish a standardized multi-site strategy to deliver safe and effective disease-specific and
risk-stratified care to children with KS and MB-NHL in SSA. We plan to achieve this goal through the following
specific aims:
Aim 1: Evaluate current practices and outcomes of children treated for cancer at PARCA sites to identify
and address barriers to implementation of standardize treatment regimens. We will perform assessments
of current clinical practices in SSA for children with HIV-associated and HIV-negative KS and MB-NHL with focus
on risk-stratification, delivery of therapy, and supportive care. Based on these results, we will identify and address
gaps in implementation of standardized regimens.
Aim 2: Determine the feasibility of implementing standardized treatment regimens for pediatric KS and
MB-NHL across PARCA sites. We will test the feasibility of implementing standardized, evidence-based, risk-
stratified treatment regimens for HIV-associated and HIV-negative KS and MB-NHL in Uganda and Malawi.
Feasibility of this approach will be determined by evaluating accuracy of risk-stratification, completion of
prescribed regimen, toxicity, treatment abandonment, and 1-year event-free and overall survival.
Aim 3: Investigate clinical and biological characteristics associated with clinical outcomes of children
with KS and MB-NHL treated on standardized PARCA treatment regimens. In order to identify clinical and
biology factors that may inform future risk-stratification strategies, we will evaluate the clinical significance of
baseline staging methods, HIV status, tumor biomarkers and explore potential for plasma cytokines to predict
response to therapy."

objective of the Core is to provide leadership and technical expertise to ensure consistency and quality control
in animal selection, execution of study protocols, application of experimental procedures, animal observations
and data collection necessary to meet the objectives of Project and other Core lead investigators. To accomplish
this, the Core will manage and directly supervise all NHP studies for the Project including: 1) animal selection;
2) animal housing and general husbandry; 3) experimental procedures and clinical management; 4) specimen
collection and processing; 5) necropsy studies; and 6) acquisition and management of animal demographic,
physiologic, clinical, and pathologic data. The overall objective of the Program Project is to determine the
mechanisms responsible for complete arrest and subsequent clearance of nascent SIV infection in RhCMV/SIV-
immunized rhesus macaques, including the requirement for MHC-E restricted epitope recognition for efficacy,
how cells mediate replication arrest and the role of IL-15 signaling identified as a predictive transcriptomic
signature. The NHP Core will provide the expertise and technical support required to insure successful
completion of the multifaceted and extensive NHP research protocols supporting Project 1 – Immunologic and

10895453,"CORE C PROJECT SUMMARY
A comprehensive understanding of the dynamic interplay between immune responses and the virus within the

basis of the ability of MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cells, but not MHC-Ia or MHC-II-restricted CD8+ T cells, to mediate
this type of protection. In order to capture the dynamic breadth and nature of the complex immunologic processes
within tissues in early primary SIV infection and to unravel the mechanisms of RhCMV/SIV vaccine efficacy, the
Advanced Spatial Analysis Core (Core C) will utilize a battery of novel high-dimensional spatial approaches to
elucidate 1) the state of the virus, including identity of infected cells, viral gene and protein expression, and
infected cell transcriptional patterns (S.A.1), and 2) essential immune cell profiles, including phenotypes,
subsets, activation/immunoregulatory states, cytokine signaling, effector functions and transcriptomic
landscapes (S.A.2) that will define the virology and immunology of established replication arrest (Project 1) and
will distinguish the in vivo immune interception of primary SIV infection by protective MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T
cells from non-protective MHC-E-, MHC-Ia- or MHC-II-restricted CD8+ T cells elicited by differentially
programmed RhCMV/SIV vectors, or MHC-Ia-restricted CD8+ T cell responses elicited by a conventional prime-
boost vaccine (Project 2). The Core will interrogate spatial virologic, phenotypic, and transcriptomic data on
single-cells, populations, and cell neighborhoods in tissues associated with SIV transmission using high-
dimensional RNAscope/DNAscope, PANINI-CODEX spatial phenotyping, and GeoMx DSP and CosMx SMI

10895456,"PROJECT 1 - PROJECT SUMMARY
A pre-clinical HIV vaccine approach based on strain 68-1 of rhesus cytomegalovirus expressing SIV antigens
(RhCMV/SIV) elicits cellular immune responses that stringently arrest replication and spread of primary SIV
infection in 59% of vaccinated rhesus macaques (RMs). The vast majority of these vaccine-protected RMs will
maintain this SIV replication arrest (a state of aviremia with replication-competent SIV in tissues) until virus
decays or is cleared to extinction over the subsequent 1-3 years. This pattern of immune-mediated viral
suppression has no prior precedent and although the precise virologic and immunological mechanisms
underpinning this phenomenon remain unknown, we have established that (a) replication arrest efficacy depends
on RhCMV/SIV elicitation of SIV-specific CD8+ T cells that target SIV peptides in the context of major
histocompatibility complex (MHC)-E rather than MHC-II or conventional MHC-Ia, and (b) that among RMs with
MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses, efficacy is predicted by a sustained whole blood transcriptomic
signature featuring IL-15 signaling. These data suggest that an innate immune/IL-15 signaling-facilitated, MHC-
E-restricted, SIV-specific CD8+ T cell response mediates/coordinate replication arrest efficacy and that the in
vivo functional outputs underlying this pattern efficacy are unique to this response and thus different from
functional outputs of other types of SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. This, in turn, suggests that detailed
functional comparison of the effective responses with other vaccine-elicited CD8+ T cell response types that fail
to mediate replication arrest efficacy (including MHC-Ia- and MHC-II-restricted responses by programmed
RhCMV/SIV and MHC-Ia-restricted responses by conventional prime-boost vaccination) will elucidate
differences that underlie the replication arrest outcome. Thus, in S.A.1 we will utilize T cell receptor (TCR)-
indexed single cell transcriptomics to identify cell-intrinsic transcriptional patterns that distinguish these SIV-
specific CD8+ T cell responses in late vaccine phase and, importantly. correlate with subsequent SIV challenge
outcome (replication arrest vs. progressive infection). In S.A.2, we will virologically characterize early replication
arrest, determining the tissue extent, cellular distribution and state of residual SIV (transcription, translation,
virion production) among 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vector-protected RM at necropsy. Our goal is to define the sites and
cells hosting replication arrest and whether it involves suppression of SIV gene expression and virion production
(analogous to deep latency) and/or an effect on target cells, rendering them resistant to viral infection. Finally, in
S.A.3, we will characterize the cellular response (both CD8+ T cells and accessory cell types) to arrested SIV
replication in RhCMV/SIV-protected RMs via bulk and single cell transcriptomics and spatial profiling in necropsy
tissues. Successful completion of these studies will further our understanding of the unique protection afforded
by CMV vectors and facilitate successful clinical translation of CMV-based vectors for a prophylactic HIV vaccine."
10895458,"PROJECT 2 - PROJECT SUMMARY
Vaccination of Rhesus macaques (RMs) with SIV insert-expressing 68-1 Rhesus Cytomegalovirus vectors
(RhCMV/SIV) elicits an immune response that in 59% of vaccinees can intercept and effectively arrest an early
spreading primary SIV infection. This unique pattern of “replication arrest” efficacy has been linked to three 68-
1 RhCMV/SIV immune characteristics, including its ability to generate and maintain: 1) high magnitude,
circulating and tissue-based, effector memory-biased CD8+ T cell responses, 2) major histocompatibility complex
(MHC)-E-restricted SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses and 3) in RMs with MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell
responses, a protection-predictive innate immune transcriptional response to vaccination that includes a central
IL-15 signaling component; however, the specific immune mechanism(s) underlying replication arrest protection
are unknown. RhCMV/SIV vectors can now be programmed by genetic manipulation to elicit SIV-specific CD8+
T cell responses that are restricted by MHC-E-only, MHC-II-only and MHC-Ia-only, and while the latter 2
response types are similar in magnitude and phenotype to the MHC-E-restricted responses, they, as well as
conventional prime-boost vaccine elicited MHC-Ia-restricted CD8+ T cell responses, are unable to mediate SIV
replication arrest. This indicates that the protective (IL-15/innate-modulated) MHC-E-restricted SIV-specific CD8+
T cells must manifest a different response upon interception of primary SIV infection than the other T cell
response types, possibly being more efficient in detecting and responding to SIV-infected cells in vivo and/or
manifesting a different (more effective) functional program upon infected cell recognition. In this project, we will
use sophisticated `omics technologies that enable detailed characterization of tissue immune responses
(including specific analyses of T cell receptor-defined, SIV-specific CD8+ T cells) to define these differences in
vivo in the actual RM tissues hosting an early spreading SIV infection. In S.A.1, we will define the systemic viral
and immune activation trajectories of unvaccinated vs. (long-term, previously protected and functionally cured)
68-1 RhCMV/SIV vaccinated RMs by analysis of serial necropsies with the goal identifying the optimal post
challenge timepoint(s) to study the cellular immune interception of viral spread prior to progressive viremia or
stable establishment of replication arrest. In S.A.2, we will use this optimized RM model to identify the unique
characteristics of RhCMV/SIV-elicited MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses in vaccinated naïve RMs that
mediate SIV replication arrest efficacy by comparison of the viral:immune intercept of these responses vs. MHC-
II-only and MHC-Ia-only SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses elicited in naïve RMs by differentially programmed
RhCMV vectors and vs. MHC-Ia-restricted CD8+ T cell responses elicited by the conventional ChAdOx1/MVA
vaccine. These contrasts will provide important insight into the immune processes responsible for replication
arrest efficacy and facilitate development of immune mechanism-based correlates of efficacy that will guide
clinical translation of a CMV-based HIV vaccine."
10895461,"PROJECT 3 - PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune responses elicited by strain 68-1 Rhesus Cytomegalovirus vaccine vectors expressing simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV) inserts (RhCMV/SIV) stringently control SIV (via “replication arrest”) in 59% of
vaccinees, with subsequent viral clearance over time. The ability of this vaccine to mediate replication arrest has
been strongly linked to its ability to elicit SIV-specific CD8+ T cells that recognize viral peptides in the context of
functionally non-polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-E rather than classical highly polymorphic
MHC-Ia. These MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell responses intercept primary SIV infection before the massive viral
replication and sequence diversification that leads to mutational escape, and thus they may only require effective
overall SIV recognition and not necessarily epitope breadth. Preliminary work by our group has found that MHC-
E-restricted TCRs and T cell clonotypes are fundamentally different from those of classical MHC-Ia-restricted
CD8+ T cell responses. Whereas conventional MHC-Ia-restricted epitope-targeted responses are mediated by
independent TCRs, MHC-E-restricted SIV-specific responses (even when directed at numerous SIV epitopes)
are largely comprised of only a handful (<10) of independent TCRs that are relatively low avidity and highly
cross-reactive – with each TCR recognizing one or more universal epitopes called supertopes (epitopes that are
recognized by all 68-1 RhCMV/SIV vaccinated RMs) and a variable number of diverse non-universal epitopes.
In this project we seek to define the minimal MHC-E-restricted CD8+ T cell TCR recognition unit capable of
mediating SIV replication arrest-type efficacy, asking the questions of whether efficacy requires recognition of
one or multiple supertopes, and whether this efficacious recognition requires one or multiple TCR clonotypes
(effectively asking whether cross-reactive TCR recognition of multiple SIV epitopes is an intrinsic requirement
for effective overall SIV-infected cell recognition and thus for efficacy). Also, given the lack of MHC-E
polymorphism, we ask whether development of a universal MHC-E-restricted supertope-targeted HIV vaccine is
possible – a vaccine that has similar specificity in all vaccinees and is broadly targeted enough to ensure efficacy-
sufficient recognition across global HIV sequence variability. These questions will be answered by addressing
the following Specific Aims: S.A.1 - to design and validate SIV inserts for miR-126-restricted (MHC-E-only) 68-1
RhCMV vectors that will (exclusively) elicit SIV MHC-E-restricted SIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses limited to
1, 2, and 10 SIV supertopes; S.A.2 - to compare immunogenicity (including response specificity, TCR clonotypic
hierarchies, and TCR cross-reactivity) and replication arrest-type efficacy of single, dual and 10 MHC-E
supertope-only vectors; and S.A.3 - to develop ex vivo engineered autologous T cells expressing validated MHC-
E-restricted SIV supertope-specific TCRs for in vivo infusion at the time of SIV challenge to determine whether
CD8+ T cells expressing protective MHC-E-restricted TCRs can mediate replication arrest efficacy in the absence
of RhCMV/SIV vaccination."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a deadly disease with a five-year survival rate of 12%. Oncogenic
KRAS (Kras*) is a near-universal driver of PDA, and its activity is required for the formation of the PDA precursor
lesions, pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). PanIN formation is accompanied by fibrosis and immune
cell infiltration that is maintained and evolves throughout disease progression. Cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs) have known roles in modulating the function of immune and cancer cells via intercellular interactions.
Displaying high degrees of heterogeneity, CAFs have tumor-promoting and tumor-restraining functions that are
thought to be mediated by distinct fibroblast populations. Data from other labs suggest that differential origins of
CAFs play a role in programming this heterogeneity. Notably, mesothelial cells, a protective monolayer of cells
that lines internal organs, are a potential, understudied source of CAFs in PDA. Preliminary experiments
described in this proposal demonstrate that in orthotopic mouse models of PDA, mesothelial cells give rise to
CAFs. Moreover, our group found that a potential population of WT1+ mesothelial-derived CAFs comprise a
transcriptionally distinct population of fibroblasts expressing high levels of cytokines with known
immunomodulatory roles in PDA. Consistent with this observation, depletion of WT1+ cells reduced expression
of these cytokines in orthotopic tumors that coincided with a reduction in tumor weight. Interestingly, an increase
in immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration was observed upon WT1+ cell depletion, suggesting that this
reduction in tumor weight can be augmented by macrophage-targeting therapeutics. Compatible with the
hypothesis that origin dictates CAF function, the overall objective of this study is to characterize sources of
CAF heterogeneity, identifying novel approaches to selectively target tumor-promoting properties of CAFs in
PDA. The central hypothesis is that mesothelial cells give rise to functionally distinct, immunomodulatory CAFs
in PDA. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following two Aims: (Aim 1) Determine the contribution
of WT1+ mesothelial cells to the fibroblast compartment in the context of PDA, and (Aim 2) Evaluate the
functional role of WT1+ cells at different stages of PDA pathogenesis. To complete this investigation, a
combination of in vivo models and in vitro assays, including macrophage polarization and migration assays, will
be used to determine the properties of mesothelial-derived CAFs and their functional roles in the PDA tumor
microenvironment. The data accumulated by this study will further the field's understanding of how cell origin
dictates fibroblast function in PDA and pave the way for development of novel fibroblast-targeting therapeutics."

 3 Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory
 4 disorders that cause damage to the gastrointestinal tract. There is no cure for IBD. Current therapies treat
5 inflammatory responses but do not target underlying causes. Research improving our understanding of
 6 underlying causes of IBD can lead to improved treatment of disease. The intestinal epithelial barrier plays a
 7 critical role in the development of chronic intestinal inflammation. There is increasing evidence that barrier
 8 function and immune responses in IBD are influenced by genetic factors and confer disease risk. While over 200
 9 genomic loci have been associated with IBD by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), only a handful of
10 these loci have known molecular mechanisms. Loci falling within non-coding regions suggests variants perturb
11 regulatory mechanisms by altering transcription factor binding and local chromatin structure but identifying exact
12 mechanisms and target genes remains challenging using GWAS alone. Mapping molecular quantitative trait loci
13 associate traits such as gene expression (eQTL) and chromatin accessibility (caQTL) with genetic variants,
14 provides evidence to functionally link variants to regulatory mechanisms and target genes. Mapping QTL in
15 diseased tissue specifically will identify regulatory mechanisms active in disease. I hypothesize that using a
16 QTL approach in colonic mucosa can reveal functional IBD variants and their regulatory mechanisms that may
17 be altered in the presence of disease. In Aim 1 I will map eQTL in IBD colon tissue to identify putative target
18 genes of IBD GWAS loci. In Aim 2 I will map caQTL in colon tissue to identify functional variants within regulatory
19 elements that may modulate expression of target genes by altering binding of transcription factors. In Aim 3 I will
20 determine the functional consequences of altered expression of CAMK2A, a putative IBD GWAS target gene,
21 on intestinal epithelial barrier function. Together, these aims will increase our understanding of the molecular
22 pathogenesis of IBD by uncovering previously unidentified regulatory mechanisms and target genes of IBD-
23 associated variants and provide novel biomarkers or candidates for therapeutic targets. This proposal seeks to
24 leverage the rigorous coursework, computational resources, collaborative environment, curated mentorship, and
25 access to clinical samples available at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to provide the best possible
26 Ph.D. training in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. This project will not only elucidate the functional role
27 of variants contributing to the molecular pathophysiology of IBD but will also provide the valuable experience
28 and training necessary for a career as an independent research investigator."

 Distressing psychosis symptoms (i.e., hallucinations and delusions), exist on a spectrum from subclinical to
those observed in diagnosed individuals, occur in an astonishing 5-8% of the general population, and are often
accompanied by disability, reduced social functioning, and cognitive impairments. Mechanisms underlying
psychosis-spectrum symptoms remain unclear, limiting development of targeted treatments. A new approach
focuses on internal body states (e.g., heartbeats, temperature) that shape experiences of self, others, and the
world, and are essential to adaptive behavior. Interoception encompasses the detection, integration, and
interpretation of internal body states, which appears disrupted and critically understudied in psychosis. Clinical
exemplars include mismatched behavior (e.g., wearing a parka in hot weather), reality distortions (e.g., believing
back pain is from a tracking device), and loss of body ownership (e.g., perceiving external control). Interoceptive
accuracy tasks reveal poor detection of internal body states across the psychosis-spectrum; however, this cannot
be separated from cognition. To move beyond descriptive work and limitations, the current study non-invasively
manipulates internal body states in a predictive coding paradigm. Further, computational modeling dissects
interoceptive predictive coding into subprocesses and disentangling relationships with psychosis symptoms
versus cognition to provide translational insights that may inform future treatment targets.
 Predictive coding is a neuro-cognitive framework, where ‘prior beliefs’ allow for predictions about incoming
sensory information for efficient responding. A prediction error results from a discrepancy between the ‘prior
belief’ and sensory information, which should update the belief for future adaptive behavior. Therefore, the brain
makes sense of the world through iterative hypothesis testing, by comparing ‘prior beliefs’ (top-down
predictions) with sensory information (bottom-up stimuli). This framework has provided valuable insight to
exteroceptive perception (e.g., auditory, visual) in psychosis-spectrum samples, where strong ‘prior beliefs’
dominate perception. Similarly, strong interoceptive ‘priors’ may drive poor interoceptive accuracy in psychosis,
and be a critically untested process contributing to both false perceptions (hallucinations) and formation of false
beliefs (delusions) that fail to reflect the environment. Computational models of predictive coding can dissect
interoceptive perception into higher- and lower-level subprocesses, including weighting of ‘prior beliefs’,
adaptability, and behavioral consistency, to test differential relationships with key clinical features of psychosis.
Thus, the current study will move the field forward by 1) testing a hypothesis of strong interoceptive ‘prior beliefs’
within the psychosis-spectrum, and 2) investigating differential relationships for subprocesses of interoceptive
predictive coding with psychosis symptoms versus cognition. Together, the proposed research and training plan
establish a critical foundation integrating cognitive science theory and computational methods with basic
interoception research to advance our understanding and treatment targets for distressing psychosis symptoms."

The function of Administrative Core A is to provide administrative coordination of scientific activities, effective
communication for the entire program. The success of this PPG is also dependent on responsible use of funds
and resources. The core will co-ordinate meetings and facilitate completion of paperwork, forms, approvals, and
scheduling matters, which will increase efficiency and allow PIs and Co-PIs to afford more time to their projects.
Another task will be to communicate effectively and in timely manner with the administrators at the National
Institutes of Health as well as to ensure statutory compliance/IRB requirements for clinical assessments of
Project III.
 Core A duties will be carried out by the Program Manager/Administrative Assistant (Joan Warner, 4.8m effort)
under the direction of Dr. Kupiec-Weglinski (0.6m effort), and by the Financial Manager/Grants Financial
Specialist at the Dumont-UCLA Transplant Center (Ivan Cortez, 1.2m effort).
 Core A will coordinate all personnel issues between departments. Ms. Joan Warner will be responsible for
scheduling and coordinating monthly meetings between the PIs, assisting with the preparation of joint abstracts,
manuscripts, conference presentations and progress reports, as well as maintaining liaison between the groups
interacting in the Program. She will also schedule meetings of the internal advisory board (twice yearly) and with
the external advisory committee (once yearly) to evaluate scientific merit of ongoing or newly proposed studies
and performance of funded investigators. Ms. Warner will arrange all travel accommodations and

The Cellular Aging Core (Core C) will isolate and distribute bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem/progenitor
cells (MSCs) from C57BL/6 mice, a common aging model for the Program Project, to the investigators of the
individual projects. Core C will also isolate and provide MSCs and myoblasts from project-specific genetically
altered (transgenic or knockout) mouse models. Furthermore, Core C will provide services for hypoxic cell
culture, multiplex cytokine assay and Seahorse mitochondrial function assays, as well as Cre-expressing
adenovirus production and infection. A key component essential to the success of the proposed Program Project
is the availability of MSCs because all projects require these cells. Thus, a centralized Core facility for the
production of quality cells, as well as providing standardized assays, are essential to the success of each
individual project, and the Program as a whole. This Core will benefit the research efforts of individual investigator
by reducing costs, providing quality control for study procedures, and enhancing collaborations among multiple
disciplines to achieve greater scientific gain through an integrated approach. In addition, production and
distribution of cells and service from a centralized facility will ensure that all studies start with cells of the same
lineages and background. By serving as a centralized resource for musculoskeletal progenitor cells and various
cellular assays, Core C will facilitate the collection of reproducible, accurate data concerning the role of
tryptophan (Trp) and kynurenine (Kyn) and their metabolites on bone and muscle in health and disease."
10906048,"The impact of nutrients and nutrient-derived metabolites on bone metabolism is an underexplored area. An age-
associated increase in the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species has been implicated in osteoporotic
disease, and our central hypothesis is that nutrient-derived oxidation products in particular play a key pathogenic
role. Our previous data demonstrate that the tryptophan breakdown product, kynurenine, acting through the aryl
hydrocarbon receptor, has detrimental effects on bone mass. This metabolism of tryptophan to produce
kynurenine is mediated by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which can be induced by interferon
and regulates the immune system. However, not all of the metabolites generated from IDO-mediated tryptophan
breakdown are detrimental (e.g., NAD+, melatonin, and picolinic acid may be beneficial). Our goal is to
characterize the physiologic effects of tissue-specific blockade of the IDO pathway and then to determine
whether selective re-addition of specific tryptophan metabolites maximizes gains in bone mass. To accomplish
these goals, we propose the following specific aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that tissue-specific knockout of IDO1
will prevent inflammation-related bone loss; and (2) Test the hypothesis that different tryptophan metabolites are
predominantly anabolic or catabolic. This project will also synergize with the other projects included in this
application looking at effects of these metabolites in aging muscle (Project 2), mitochondrial function and cell
senescence (Project 3) and in terms of sex-specific effects (Project 4). These innovative studies, together with
the other tightly integrated projects of the Program Project proposal should provide new therapeutic targets for
improving musculoskeletal health and increasing healthspan."

We seek renewed partial support for the next three meetings (2024, 2026 and 2028) of the premier
conference on retinal neuroscience: “Retinal Neurobiology and Visual Processing,” administered by the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). This unique forum attracts top retinal
and vision scientists with diverse backgrounds in systems and cellular neurobiology, computational and
developmental biology and vision research. Interaction is extensive throughout the five-day meeting and
offers stimulating debate, sound guidance, and fertile ground for collaboration. The 2024 conference will be
held June 16 - 21 at the Southbridge Hotel & Conference Center in Southbridge, Massachusetts and
represents the 16th meeting of this highly valued biennial conference, which was first held in 1992. The
provisional program provides a comprehensive survey of groundbreaking new research into topics of
profound interest to the early-vision community, including: 1) retinal synapses; 2) circuit development; 3)
photoreceptors and outer retinal processing; 4) retinal ganglion cells: coding and computation; 5) non-image
forming vision; 6) retinal pathways and behavior; 7) degeneration and regeneration and 8) visual
processing: beyond the retina. In addition, two interactive workshops are planned: new advances in
molecular techniques for cellular and systems neuroscience; and career development for early
investigators. Two special sessions will feature exciting and timely work selected from submitted poster
abstracts from junior colleagues, especially graduate students. These highly popular “Data Blitz” sessions
allow 24 junior colleagues to present a five-minute synopsis of their poster to the full conference audience.
This ensures active engagement of junior participants and stimulates attendance at the poster sessions.
Programming for the 2026 and 2028 meetings will be developed closer to those dates, to allow organizers
to feature the latest work, but the goals remain constant: a diverse and engaging set of formal
presentations; and intensive and productive informal exchanges spanning the retinal processing field. As
reflected in the proposed program and documented positive feedback from younger attendees, we design
the meeting to engage and serve our pre- and postdoctoral trainees, as well as early-stage independent
investigators. We provide travel awards to help junior members attend the meeting, provide opportunities to
speak or otherwise present their work and provide poster prizes to acknowledge their accomplishments.
Graduate students obtain experience in public presentation, expand their conceptual and technical horizons
and enjoy extended access to world-class faculty as they plan the next stage of their careers. We reserve
many plenary talks for advanced postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty to enhance their visibility and career
development and place special emphasis on recruiting speakers from underrepresented groups in science."
10879920,"Project Summary.
Neuroimaging provides unparalleled advantages in the ability to understand the neural
architecture underlying human thought, feeling, and behavior. Modern approaches
combine methodological advances in data acquisition with predictive modeling and
larger and more diverse datasets. The result is increasingly sophisticated models that
can map patterns of activity onto mental states, behaviors, and experiences. However,
there are fundamental limitations impeding progress. First, brains differ in their individual
functional topography. Second, it is difficult to make inferences about the spatial
topography of brain responses and their variability across individuals. Recent work on
inter-subject functional alignment promises to revolutionize brain systems-level modeling
of behaviors and mental states by aligning meso-scale activity patterns across
individuals. The most popular approach is hyperalignment (HA), which aligns functional
brain representations across individuals based on assumptions of a shared
representational geometry. However, a large body of work shows that much information
about functional brain representations is contained in macro-scale topographical maps.
This conventional functional topography is defined on a different, shape-preserving
topological manifold better captured using diffeomorphic alignment. We address these
issues, providing new ways of modeling topography, making topographical inferences,
and making inferences about the topological and geometrical spaces underlying brain
representations. We propose to develop diffeomorphic latent space models (DLSMs)
that preserve and provide spatial inferences on large-scale topography. Further, we will
develop a new class of HA models that place spatial constraints on the transformations,
providing fine-scale alignment of representational geometry while minimizing
topographical disruption. Finally, we will combine this enhanced HA approach with the
DLSM model to create a multi-scale framework that uses diffeomorphic transformations
to address large-scale individual differences, followed by geometric transformations to
address remaining meso-scale differences. This will allow us for the first time to
investigate the relative contributions of topological vs geometrical alignment of data in
different brain regions."
10879975,"SUMMARY: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a highly prevalent disease that inflicts a severe quality-of-life
(QOL) impairment, with local symptoms of nasal blockage, congestion, loss of smell, nasal drainage,
headache, and recurrent infections. CRS is also appreciated for its prominent role as a compounding factor in
other respiratory diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma/COPD, and cystic fibrosis. General health concerns
including fatigue, sleep dysfunction, anxiety/depression, excessive medication usage, frequent physician visits,
and productivity loss often accompany nasal symptoms and contribute to overall health detriment. As a result
of local symptom burden and overall health disturbance, CRS has been ranked among the most severe health
ailments, alongside congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease.
 Among existing therapeutic options for CRS, outcomes vary widely. The stepwise approach to CRS
management results in slow and measured escalation of care only after repeated attempts at various medical
therapies. As nuanced understanding of disease trajectories are uncovered through deep phenotyping of
individuals with CRS, a precision approach to this chronic disease is on the horizon. A patient’s decision to
commit to aggressive CRS treatment, such as surgery, includes many personal factors but inherently relies on
the likelihood for symptom improvement. Not surprisingly, the degree of symptom improvement gained is the
primary contributor to patient satisfaction with the intervention. Though numerous risk factors have been
associated with symptom severity and outcomes in CRS, there is a notable void in translation of these
observations to real-world, clinical decision-making. This is due to the many possible predictor variables,
unclear disease natural history, and weakness of traditional statistical approaches in dealing with noisy data.
Indeed, weighing these many considerations is a complex clinical task.
 Our long-term goal is to create a personalized predictive model that can help individual patients understand
their likely outcomes with available therapeutic options. Translating research observations into a
comprehensible platform for shared decision-making, precision medicine, and rational allocation of system
resources (i.e., cost-benefit analyses) would be truly innovative in CRS. Our central hypothesis is that machine
learning and artificial intelligence approaches can be applied to myriad demographic and clinical data to infer
clinical outcomes for individuals deciding when to pursue surgical treatment for CRS. The proposed research is
significant because of its potential to: (1) illuminate how disease manifestations occur in some but not all CRS
patients, (2) predict patient trajectories and inform clinical interventions, (3) support real-time clinical decision
making, (4) develop new patient-centered treatment algorithms, and (5) serve as an initial study of predictive
analytics informing the decision for elective surgical therapies in chronic disease."

The function of the nervous system is dependent on complex interactions between networks of neurons
composed of multiple neuron types. Understanding how these networks function both in health and disease is
dependent on understanding the precise connectivity between specific neuron types and their functional
interactions in the intact brain. It is therefore apparent that, in order to have an adequate understanding of the
nervous system, it is necessary to have detailed descriptions of neuronal connectivity with the same level of
precision at which these systems operate and to selectively manipulate and measure the activity of specific cell
types in the context of the normal functioning network. Such studies would be greatly facilitated by the ability to
target gene expression to specific cell types in the context of AAV vectors. The aims of this proposal are
designed to first test and overcome possible limitations in the use of AAV vectors targeting gene expression to
SST- and PV-expressing inhibitory internueon in the visual cortex, and then to use these tools to selectively
manipulate the activity and characterize the functions of these inhibitory subclasses. The establishment of the
utility of these reagents will allow future studies testing the functional contributions of specific inhibitory neuron
types to perception,cognition and behavior."

Understanding the dynamic cell-cell communication networks that establish immunological activity in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) would transform therapeutic strategies to help cancer patients that are unresponsive
to checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs). To this end, the overall objective of this proposal is to determine networks of
intercellular secreted signals that distinguish ineffective tumor-immune responses from effective ones in order to
identify new targets to improve efficacy of cancer immunotherapy (CIT). To achieve this objective, extensive
single-cell analysis will be performed on mouse models of melanoma and samples from human melanoma
patients in response to CPI-targeting of T cells, and CITs targeting tumor associated monocytes and
macrophages (TAMs). These data will be computationally analyzed to construct cell-cell interaction networks
between stromal, tumor, and immune cells to identify interactions that maintain immunosuppressive TMEs,
predict how to target them, and test these predictions experimentally. The central hypothesis tested in this
proposal is that intercellular signaling networks between TAMs and other cells in the TME are central to
suppressing immune activity, and that TAM-mediated networks are critical to reestablishing an effective TME
immune response, especially in cases of CPI resistance due to inadequate T cell responses. The rationale for
the proposed research is that identifying cell-cell interactions that distinguish immunosuppressive versus
immunosupportive TMEs will serve as a roadmap of new targets to test in unresponsive tumors. Aim 1 will
develop computational models that can distinguish between an ineffective versus effective anti-tumor immune
response. These models will be developed by constructing intercellular networks of receptor-ligand interactions
from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and pathology data in growing and regressing murine and human
melanoma tumors. The models will be used to identify targets mediating cell-cell interactions that will be validated
experimentally. The objective of Aim 2 will be to determine how the functional plasticity of macrophages and
other myeloid cells contributes to an immunosuppressive TME in mice and human melanomas. Interactome
maps will be expanded to identify interactions between myeloid cell subsets and other cell types in the tumor
over time and with treatment. The proposed research is innovative because, rather than focusing solely on
isolated end points (e.g., T cell infiltration), it will identify the network of intercellular communication that stabilizes
those endpoints. With respect to cancer systems biology, the proposed research is innovative because it will
combine new computational methods–for defining cell subsets and network interactions from scRNA-seq data
and constructing predictive classification models–with syngeneic mouse melanoma models and human patient
samples that are ideally suited to evaluate CIT responses. The proposed research is significant because it will
redefine the hallmarks of immune activity in the TME as emergent properties of multiple cell-cell interactions that
can be pharmacologically targeted to design immunotherapies that will be effective on non-responding patients."

Mounting evidence shows the microbial communities living in (and on) the human body play a key role in the
etiology of disease. A major obstacle in the field is the dearth of reliable methods for extracting meaningful signals
from small, noisy, intercorrelated, and highly variable microbiome datasets. Enhancing the ability of researchers
to generate robust characterizations of the complex relationship between microbiota and their hosts will support
novel, more reliable diagnosis of disease and bring the field one step closer to finding the causal links underlying
microbiome-based therapeutics. Until now, however, researchers have not had the huge volume of data required
to draw these conclusions. Although microbiome data from hundreds of thousands of samples is available in the
NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), these datasets have not been leveraged at a large scale. To bridge this
gap, we will build an automated pipeline to process and aggregate more than 750,000 samples of amplicon and
shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from all publicly available human microbiome samples. We will build a
platform, which we call ""The Human Microbiome Compendium,"" for compiling collections of relevant samples
that can be used by researchers to find ecological dynamics that have until now been hidden in the noise. The
compendium will allow users to see relative abundances of microbial taxa in every sample, which will also be
linked to NCBI metadata and annotations generated by a new tool that imputes a uniform set of descriptors for
sample type, body site, and host traits. We will also use the compendium to train machine learning models for
dimensionality reduction, which will improve the power of independent microbiome studies by incorporating
insights from the compendium's collection of hundreds of thousands of samples. These data and tools will be
distributed across multiple channels, including a web application where users will be able to upload data to be
processed in real time by the dimensionality reduction tools. The proposed studies will generate the first
comprehensive aggregation of the microbiome datasets available via the SRA, which will be used to provide
characterizations of the human microbiome in unprecedented detail. The resulting compendium will encourage
the use of publicly available data and inform new microbiome analysis tools that will help extract important
associations in studies where it's impractical to acquire the sample sizes required by conventional techniques.
Results from this study will be a starting point to identification of microbiome biomarkers for disease and the
development of novel therapeutic approaches."
10891471,"Presynaptic inhibitory synapses positioned across axon terminals of sensory neurons critically regulate
information flow across sensory circuits, allowing meaningful interactions of an organism with its external
environment. Whereas much is known about the functional role of presynaptic inhibitory synapses across
sensory circuits; little is known about the mechanisms that regulate the development, maturation and
maintenance of these inhibitory synapses. Using the well-characterized dim-light (rod) visual circuit of the
mammalian retina we uncovered a synaptic reorganization during assembly of GABAergic presynaptic inhibitory
synapses that regulate dim-light retinal output. The current proposal aims to determine the cell-autonomous and
non-cell autonomous mechanisms that regulate this developmental plasticity during assembly of inhibitory
feedback circuits that regulate the gain of sensory (retinal) signal transfer. Our research will yield fundamental
information about: (i) retinal circuit assembly (ii) organization of sensory circuits and mechanisms that regulate
sensory feedback, and (iii) principles that regulate receptor plasticity during establishment of inhibitory circuits
across the CNS. We will combine murine transgenic approaches with high resolution light microscopy, 3D
electron microscopy and electrophysiology to address the following three Aims. In Aim 1 we will determine if cell-autonomous alterations in chloride transporter expression across developing retinal rod bipolar neurons drive
and regulate the timing and/or occurrence of the developmental GABAA receptor reorganization. Aim 2 will
determine the contribution(s) of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission onto the retinal rod bipolar neuron in
regulating the developmental GABAA receptor plasticity. Aim 3 will determine the role of early visual experience
in regulating GABAA receptor reorganizations and assembly of feedback inhibitory synapses of the dim-light
retinal circuit. Our research will reveal the interplay between cell-autonomous mechanisms, synaptic input,
network activity and environmental cues during establishment and maturation of feedback inhibitory circuits that
regulate sensory output. Our study will also reveal circuit plasticity motifs that can be recruited to ameliorate
dysfunction during retinal diseases. Furthermore, our findings will determine the developmental sequence of
maturation during assembly of invivo presynaptic inhibitory circuits to compare with exvivo retinal assembly such
as when pluripotent stem cells are used for retinogenesis."
10891476,"Abstract. Long-term survival of patients with glioblastomas (GBM) are associated with two competing priorities:
1) gross total resection and 2) preservation of the patient’s function. Stereotactic navigation, in which
reconstructed magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain are used for real-time intraoperative anatomic
guidance, has become an essential tool for tumor resection. Further, there are emerging insights that glioma-
specific perturbations of the functional organization of the brain impact the patient’s survival. However, the
current barrier is that there is no FDA approved navigation system that enables the surgeon to visualize the
functional architecture of the brain and the impact a tumor has on the brain’s network organization to inform
prognosis. Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for mapping clinically relevant
brain networks and defining critical glioma-neuronal interactions. rs-fMRI is highly efficient, task independent,
and multiple resting state networks (RSNs) can be mapped simultaneously. With this in mind, the long-term goal
of our research is to improve treatment, survival, and quality of life for patients with brain tumors by improving
the identification of eloquent cortex and providing actionable metrics for survival prognosis to best tailor a
patient’s care. In our first Academic Industry Partnership between Washington University and Medtronic we were
extremely productive in creating an integrated brain-mapping navigation technology using rs-fMRI. Specifically,
we created a robust image acquisition/analysis pipeline that includes pre-processing of raw data, quality control
analytics, and clinical validation demonstrating superior performance over task-based fMRI. We have also been
leaders in deriving prognostic radiomic biomarkers from rs-fMRI. In this continuation, we will build on these
successes. The overall objective is to create advanced rs-fMRI machine learning (ML) tools to more efficiently
and accurately define functional cortex and provide preoperative prognostic metrics of survival as a
comprehensive surgical/care navigation system. We have the expertise, infrastructure, and data, to advance rs-
fMRI to be a powerful tool for neurosurgical decision support. The proposal entails three specific aims: 1)
Advance an ML algorithm to enable more accurate and data efficient rs-fMRI brain-mapping software, 2) Create
an rs-fMRI ML algorithm to preoperatively predict survival in glioblastoma (GBM) patients, and 3) Validate impact
of mapping and prognostic algorithms on clinical decision making in prospective feasibility clinical trial. The
expected outcome of this work will be an integrated imaging/surgical navigation technology using rs-fMRI for
clinical decision support with defined performance, clinical validation, and a regulatory path for FDA clearance.
Thus, this proposal is innovative because 1) the software will map networks with substantially shorter image
acquisition times, thus enabling more widespread adoption and 2) provide critical pre-operative survival insights
to inform surgical decisions. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally
enhances more tailored approaches to improving patient outcomes and quality of life."
10897536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Given the recent SARS CoV2 pandemic, and monkeypox outbreak, there is an urgent unmet need to understand
immunity in our barrier tissues (e.g. skin, lung, and gut) where viruses are encountered. Tissue specific memory
is needed for long-lived protective immunity, including immunization strategies that target infections and cancers
of the tissue. T resident memory cells are long-lived memory populations generated by infections, cancers, and
vaccines. Tissue resident memory T cells maintain long-term protective immunity to re-encountered pathogens
(which include CoV2 and influenza in lung, and herpes, monkeypox, and smallpox in skin). Tissue resident
memory T cells also survey against primary cancers and metastases. However, in pathogenic contexts tissue
resident memory cells drive autoimmune memory recall. This proposal tests intervenable regulatory mechanisms
when skin-specific T resident memory cells are formed, maintained, and governed, and a regulatory axis with
local tissue Dendritic Cells. Our goal is foundational: to understand the basic principles by which barrier immunity,
and T cell receptor repertoire is generated and shaped in the tissues, like skin. We apply our findings to important
and relevant in vivo mouse models for infection and test the consequences for tissue inflammation, autoimmunity,
and protective memory recall. Establishing a mechanistic groundwork and robust preclinical modeling is needed
to later test interventions. This work is also likely to offer basic insight into the foundational mechanisms by which

The administrative core serves as the operational hub of the SPORE, arranging all SPORE related functions in
scientific review, intra- and inter-SPORE collaborations, financial management of budgeting and monitoring
expenses, editorial services as needed and grant administration. We also regard the SPORE as a forum for
education and mentoring, above and beyond what is directly assisted in the developmental programs, by
creating an environment in which new ideas for projects can be discussed with supportive SPORE key
personnel. The Core will coordinate the functions of the internal and external advisory boards and liaise with
the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) breast cancer disease management team over
identification and monitoring of the cancer patient populations required for this SPORE and communicate with
our patient advocates about our ongoing results, trials and future planning."
10899206,"Project Summary
Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) use has been a major public health concern. The U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) continues to cite health effects as a chief rationale in FDA enforcement priorities and
marketing denials. Childhood to adolescence represents a critical period with rapid development in brain
maturation. Combustible cigarette smoking during adolescence can negatively impact brain development, and
animal models also show that nicotine exposure in adolescent rodents slows brain maturation, including the
prefrontal cortex. However, the impact of rising ENDS use on youth brain functions and cognitive outcomes is
poorly understood. Vaping delivers much lower levels of tobacco smoke chemicals but similar levels of nicotine
compared to cigarette smoking. Studying the effects of vaping on brain maturation can illuminate nicotine effects
without tobacco smoking. Importantly, there is a dearth of evidence on the relative effects of exclusive ENDS
use vs. combustible cigarette smoking on youth brain maturation, which is critical to the FDA’s regulatory actions
on ENDS and prioritizing public health programs. This population study will analyze the longitudinal Adolescent
Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study with 11,878 youth aged 9-10 years old at baseline from 21 U.S.
study sites, to assess the effects of exclusive ENDS use on youth’s brain structure and cognitive performances
and further examine potentially differential effects of vaping vs. smoking on neurocognition. The study will link
the first 5 biannual waves of ABCD magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data during 2016-2024 with semiannual
tobacco use assessments and annual behavioral measures by Subject ID to create a harmonized longitudinal
dataset. In Aim 1, the team will prospectively examine the effects of exclusive ENDS use (vs. never tobacco use)
on whole-brain morphometric measures (e.g., white/gray matter, cortical thickness). In Aim 2, the team will
assess the longitudinal associations of exclusive ENDS use (vs. never tobacco use) on attention, memory,
executive function, emotion regulation, and reward processing at the cognitive level, using validated behavioral
tasks sensitive to youth development (e.g., NIH Toolbox), and at the brain level using functional MRI tasks. In
both Aims 1 and 2, we will further test whether differences in brain maturation are negatively associated with
vaping frequency, intensity, and duration among ENDS users. In Aim 3, the relative effect of exclusive ENDS
use vs. cigarette smoking on whole brain structure and NIH Cognition Toolbox will be tested. This study is
innovative by 1) leveraging the largest brain development and child health study with state-of-the-art
neurocognitive assessments, and 2) applying the mariginal structural modeling to handle time-dependent
exposure and time-varying confounders, thus allowing for unbiased effect estimation and teasing out potentially
reverse causality. This study is also significant in providing vital evidence on vital evidence of vaping effects on
brain health, thus providing vital evidence to inform effective regulatory actions and public policies.

 The Administrative Core (Core A) has two major functions: to provide an effective venue for efficient
coordination of the projects and the scientific core to ensure the success of this PPG, and to provide
administrative support to the Program Director and all three projects and the scientific core in this PPG to
ensure effective and open communication, fiscal soundness, and regulatory compliance. Core A is a conduit
for communication and coordination of this PPG with internal and external advisory boards and other stake-
holders. The Administrative Core will be led by the Program Director who will be assisted by Core A staff
including an experienced Program Coordinator. The Executive Committee, which comprises project and core

Leader uses to direct and manage this PPG."
10903750,"CORE B PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the most significant challenges for understanding genetic control of blood pressure (BP) is that the vast
majority of BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in humans are located in noncoding
regions of DNA. The major objective of this PPG is to understand the functional relevance of BP-associated
noncoding SNPs in specific BP relevant cell types using epigenomics and genome editing. A key approach that
all three projects of this PPG have adopted to accomplish this objective is the application of next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies. These include RNA-seq (to analyze mRNA and lncRNA profiles), small
noncoding RNA-seq (i.e., sncRNA-seq, to analyze microRNA profiles), RRBS (to measure DNA methylation
patterns), ATAC-seq (to determine chromatin accessibility), CUT&Tag (to detect DNA-protein interactions) and
Hi-C (to uncover chromatin interactions). The goal of Core B is to provide the highly specialized expertise
required for these analyses. Over five years, three projects of this PPG will analyze 725 RNA-seq, 20 sncRNA-
seq, 65 RRBS, 20 Hi-C, 155 CUT&Tag and 65 ATAC-seq libraries. Sample and library preparation will be
carried out by the staff of individual projects. Cluster generation and sequencing will be performed by the well-
established MCW Sequencing Service Center via fee-for-service. The role of Core B is coordinating
sequencing activities to improve efficiencies and performing the vast majority of the data analysis including the
processing and mapping of the sequence reads, identification and quantification of transcripts or CpG regions,
calling peaks of DNA-protein interaction, chromatin interaction and accessibility, integrative analysis of omics
data and downstream analysis (e.g., gene ontology and biological pathways). The Core therefore has two
specific aims. Aim 1 is to coordinate the multiplexing and submission of NGS libraries for sequencing. Aim 2 is
to analyze and manage sequencing data for all three projects. Core B Director P. Liu, Co-Investigator M. Liang
and Y. Liu were founding members of an interest group initiated by Dr. Liang in 2010 and involving 12
laboratories from seven departments at MCW that adopted NGS technologies to analyze RNA and later RRBS
and other NGS applications at MCW. The wet lab and dry lab pipeline established as a result of this effort has
been used in > 20 publications. Importantly, this group has published some of the first studies of mRNA,
lncRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation and chromatin conformation in hypertension research that utilized RNA-seq,
sncRNA-seq, RRBS and chromatin conformation capture. Therefore, Core B has the experience and the highly
specialized expertise to ensure the success of these omics data analyses that are critical components of the
three projects."
10903753,"PROJECT 1 PROJECT SUMMARY
The vast majority of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex human traits, including
blood pressure (BP), are located in noncoding regions of DNA. These noncoding SNPs, especially the ones
located in haplotype regions far from protein-coding genes, most likely influence BP by regulating gene
expression. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies are beginning to enable the identification of
associations between noncoding SNPs and gene expression.
 However, very few studies have gone beyond associations to examine the functional effect of BP-
associated noncoding SNPs on gene expression. Such studies would have to overcome substantial
challenges. First, BP-associated noncoding SNPs could regulate the expression of distant protein-coding
genes through chromatin folding or noncoding RNA, which means one cannot assume that the protein-coding
genes that the SNPs regulate are the ones that are sequentially closest to the SNPs. Second, results from
eQTL and other studies indicate the effect of noncoding SNPs on gene expression is often cell type-specific.
 In Project 1 of this PPG, we have developed several approaches and methods to overcome these
challenges and to test the overall hypothesis that BP-associated noncoding SNPs regulate the expression of
genes that are physiologically important to BP regulation. All three aims in Project 1 share the goal of
identifying the effect of BP-associated noncoding SNPs on gene expression in BP-relevant cell types. Each
aim will focus on a group of LD (linkage disequilibrium) regions located far from any protein-coding gene and a
specific hypothesis. The mechanistic aspect of each hypothesis will be tested in Projects 2 and 3 of this PPG.
The feasibility of Project 1 is supported by an extensive series of preparatory and preliminary studies.
 The overall goal of this PPG proposal is to identify genes regulated by human BP-associated
noncoding SNPs, examining the underlying mechanisms, and investigating their influence on BP. Project 1
focuses on the first part of the overall goal and will contribute to the goal of the program through extensive
integration with Projects 2 and 3. Project 1 will rely on Core B for extensive RNA-seq analysis."
10903755,"PROJECT 2 PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension remains the most important risk factor for a wide variety of cardiovascular diseases accounting
for approximately 54 percent of all strokes and 47 percent of all ischemic heart disease events globally.
Despite the fact that we know there is a significant genetic component that determines the level of blood
pressure (BP; estimates of heritability of BP range from 30-70%) we are far from understanding the myriad of
genetic factors that account for BP variation in humans. One of the most significant challenges for
understanding genetic control of BP is that the vast majority of BP-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) that have been identified in human genome wide association studies (GWAS) are located in noncoding
regions of DNA. Many of the noncoding SNPs (ncSNPs) are in haplotype regions located thousands of base
pairs away from any protein-coding gene making it nearly impossible to link the SNPs to a protein-coding gene
or a physiological pathway that regulates BP based on sequence and our current knowledge of the mechanism
of action for the SNPs. In this project we will focus on testing the specific hypothesis that many ncSNPs
identified in GWAS impact the expression of BP relevant genes through epigenetic mechanisms. Epigenetics
refers to stable changes in DNA function that are not directly due to changes in the sequence of DNA.
Epigenomics refers to such changes when they occur across the entire genome. Therefore, we will use state-
of-the-art epigenomic and epigenetic approaches to probe the epigenetic mechanisms by which individual
ncSNPs impact the expression of genes associated with BP in human GWAS. Using nephron segments that
we will micro-dissect from fresh human kidney and human resistance arterioles isolated from gluteal biopsies
as well as related cell types that will be derived from human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we will
create an epigenomic map of human BP related cells and tissues at an unprecedented tissue resolution.
Using that map combined with our bioinformatic analysis of human GWAS SNP data and data from Project 1 in
this PPG (effects of BP ncSNPs on gene expression) we will then test specific epigenetic mechanisms for
individual SNPs. Finally, we will perform validation studies in which precision genome editing and targeted
epigenetic analysis are utilized to determine if the hypothesized mechanisms are responsible for changes in
gene expression in BP-relevant cell types. This project is highly collaborative with the other projects and cores
in this Program Project Grant through the sharing of reagents (cells and tissues), transfer of data, and the
intellectual environment of the investigators and their laboratories."

Despite the fact that we know there is a significant genetic component that determines the level of blood
pressure (estimates of heritability for hypertension range from 30-70%) we are far from understanding the
myriad of genetic factors that account for blood pressure (BP) variation in humans. One of the most significant
challenges for understanding the vast majority of identified BP-associated genetic variations is dissecting the
mechanisms of those variants located in regions of DNA that do not encode proteins. In some cases, these
variations affect genes that are hundreds of thousands of base pairs away. We believe that some of these
genetic variants may affect how the chromosomes are folded in the cell and affect how blood-pressure related
genes interact in those folds to control blood pressure. In this project we will focus on testing the specific
hypothesis that chromatin conformation and interaction of BP-related genes with their proper regulatory
sequences is important in BP regulation. We will use animal models where we genetically disrupt the
chromosomes around genes which are known to play a role in blood pressure regulation. We will also use
advanced genomic profiling techniques to identify the locations where these interactions occur for tissues such
as blood vessels and segments of the nephron of the kidney that are related to BP regulation and use this data
to build an `epigenomic' map of chromatin structure, DNA binding proteins, and other features between rats
and humans that will allow us to identify and study similar mechanisms for other genes. This project is highly
collaborative with the other projects and cores in this Program Project Grant through the sharing of reagents

Hypertension (HTN) is the leading contributor to preventable death, and a major risk factor for cardiovascular
(CV) events. Suboptimal blood pressure (BP) control is the most common attributable CV risk factor, accounting
for 56% of the burden of ischemic heart disease and 57% of stroke burden. BP control is also critical for reducing
risk of recurrent CV events and improving outcomes after stroke and myocardial infarction (MI), yet control rates
in these patients remain suboptimal, particularly for racial/ethnic minority populations served by safety net health
systems. In addition to a higher burden of HTN and poor awareness, treatment, and control rates for these
vulnerable communities, social determinants of health (SDOH) like low socioeconomic status (SES), limited
English proficiency (LEP), and underinsurance- pose additional challenges to BP control. Thus, to reduce
racial/ethnic and SDOH-rooted disparities in BP control after stroke or MI, innovative interventions are needed,
addressing healthcare system, patient, and community level factors. Past health system interventions have been
effective, particularly those that utilize chronic care model-based interventions, pharmacist-led medication
management, and team-based management like community health workers (CHWs). Interventions that have
succeeded at the patient level include those designed to expand health care access (telehealth: patient portal,
remote BP self-monitoring), health literacy, and improve health behaviors (exercise and diet). Los Angeles
County, with a population of 11 million, is ethnically and racially diverse, with stark socioeconomic and health
disparities. Nearly half of adults are born outside the United States and 18% have incomes <100% federal
poverty level. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) system, the 2nd largest
municipal health system in the United States serves LAC's most vulnerable residents through 4 hospitals and
23 ambulatory care centers. We have conducted prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve post-stroke
BP control in this safety net, and are currently conducting a primary prevention trial among individuals with HTN.
Building upon our experience testing multilevel complex interventions for improving BP control in this low-income
multi-ethnic setting, we propose the BP REACH study (Blood Pressure disparities Reduction, Equity, and Access
among safety net patients with Cardiovascular Health risk) to: 1) Design a multilevel, culturally and linguistically
tailored, complex intervention that seeks health equity for vulnerable safety net patients by prioritizing
pharmacist-med medication management and CHW chronic disease education and outreach based in the
SDOH, to reduce BP among multi-racial, multi-ethnic individuals with a history of stroke or MI in the LAC-DHS
safety-net; 2) Test the impact of this intervention on SBP for individuals with a history of stroke or MI in a
randomized trial in LAC-DHS cardiology and neurology care clinics and 3) Determine the effect of mediators on
the primary outcome of systolic BP in the intervention."

addressing healthcare system, patient, and community level factors. Past health system interventions have been
effective, particularly those that utilize chronic care model-based interventions, pharmacist-led medication
management, and team-based management like community health workers (CHWs). Interventions that have
succeeded at the patient level include those designed to expand health care access (telehealth: patient portal,
remote BP self-monitoring), health literacy, and improve health behaviors (exercise and diet). Los Angeles
County, with a population of 11 million, is ethnically and racially diverse, with stark socioeconomic and health
disparities. Nearly half of adults are born outside the United States and 18% have incomes <100% federal
poverty level. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) system, the 2nd largest
municipal health system in the United States serves LAC's most vulnerable residents through 4 hospitals and
23 ambulatory care centers. We have conducted prior randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to improve post-stroke
BP control in this safety net, and are currently conducting a primary prevention trial among individuals with HTN.
Building upon our experience testing multilevel complex interventions for improving BP control in this low-income
multi-ethnic setting, we propose the BP REACH study (Blood Pressure disparities Reduction, Equity, and Access
among safety net patients with Cardiovascular Health risk) to: 1) Design a multilevel, culturally and linguistically
tailored, complex intervention that seeks health equity for vulnerable safety net patients by prioritizing
pharmacist-med medication management and CHW chronic disease education and outreach based in the
SDOH, to reduce BP among multi-racial, multi-ethnic individuals with a history of stroke or MI in the LAC-DHS
safety-net; 2) Test the impact of this intervention on SBP for individuals with a history of stroke or MI in a
randomized trial in LAC-DHS cardiology and neurology care clinics and 3) Determine the effect of mediators on
the primary outcome of systolic BP in the intervention."
10913627,"Health disparities in rural America begin early in life, arising from social determinants of health that start in 
childhood. School health programs often provide the only access to preventive services for rural children. 
However, school screening is variably implemented, plagued by loss to follow-up, and limited specialists in rural 
areas compound barriers to care. We propose to prospectively implement a novel model of care in Appalachian 
schools of rural Kentucky to address social determinants at the school, health system, and policy levels that 
hinder identification and treatment of preventable health disparities for two NIH-designated disparity populations: 
underserved rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Our goal is to establish a novel, 
generalizable model of school-based, telehealth-driven preventive care that can be disseminated in
underserved populations across rural America. We will adapt and evaluate our evidence-based approach, 
“STAR” (Specialty Telemedicine Access for Referrals), that we have found effective in a Tribal setting in rural 
Alaska. Appalachia has some of the poorest counties in the US, making this region ideal for adapting across 
rural America. The innovative “Appalachian STAR trial” will be the first study to apply school-based telehealth 
for preventive services, with direct access to specialists. Hearing screening will be the prototype for STAR due 
to the high burden of preventable, infection-related hearing loss in underserved children and the profound lifelong 
implications of childhood hearing loss. Our interdisciplinary team has relationships with underserved 
communities in Kentucky and partnership with a Community Advisory Board and Stakeholder Advisory Board 
providing support from the highest levels of state government (See KY Governor Letter). We will begin by 
adapting the STAR model of care to meet the needs of rural communities and schools through a community-and stakeholder-driven approach. We will evaluate the STAR care model in 66 schools in rural Kentucky through 
a stepped wedge cluster-randomized hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial with kindergarten children 
in 14 counties (n=~3600/year). The STAR intervention includes county-level school screening policy change with
enhanced mHealth school hearing screening, followed by virtual specialty care referral. The stepped-wedge 
design allows evaluation of the policy/screening and referral components as well as comparison of usual care 
vs. full intervention (years 2 vs.5), while meeting community input that the intervention be available to all. Primary 
outcomes are the percentage of 1) children screened and 2) referrals resulting in specialty care within two months 
of screening. We conservatively hypothesize the percentage screened will improve by 20% and follow-up will 
improve by 40%. During the trial, we will assess multi-level implementation factors and outcomes to inform scale-up into other rural areas. Our STAR model could be both scaled across rural America and applied to other 
preventable health disparities, combining policy change on school health with digital innovations to radically 
expand access to care for underserved rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged children nationwide."
10900163,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adolescence is the developmental period most strongly associated with the initiation and escalation of
substance use, making it an ideal time to identify protective factors against substance use. Alcohol and
cannabis are among the most used substances in adolescence and their use is associated with negative
consequences. Solidifying emotion regulation strategies and healthful behaviors in adolescence may protect
against later deleterious substance use outcomes. Yet research on the mechanisms underlying substance
use behavior change in adolescents is limited. Consistent with NIDA priorities on prevention targets, there
is a need to focus on the developmental trajectory and elucidation of protective mediators (e.g., happiness,
pleasurable activities) associated with alcohol and cannabis outcomes (e.g., alcohol use, binge drinking,
cannabis use, alcohol-related consequences, cannabis-related consequences) across adolescence. This
study addresses a critical gap in the literature by conducting longitudinal mediation analyses with secondary
data using a large sample of adolescents from the Happiness and Health study (5U54CA180905). This
project is significant in its positive psychological approach of examining positive emotions and pleasurable
experiences rather than solely substance reduction, and in filling a research gap on mediators of substance
use in adolescents. This project is innovative in its integration of the broaden-and-build theory with
behavioral theories of choice by examining how happiness and pleasurable activities are associated. The
broaden-and-build theory posits that experiencing happiness may increase one’s personal resources,
allowing one to come up with a wider range of novel behavioral activities. These expanded behavioral
activities may include novel healthful activities, such as spending time with family or exercising, which are
associated with reduced substance use. Behavioral theories of choice suggest that pleasurable activities
may substitute and protect against substance use and related consequences. The innovative integration of
the broaden-and-build theory and behavioral theories of choice suggests that experiencing happiness may
be associated with improved alcohol and cannabis outcomes through the pathway of pleasurable activities.
The proposed study will examine whether changes in happiness and changes in pleasurable activities are
associated with changes in alcohol and cannabis outcomes (Aim 1), and whether pleasurable activities work
as a mechanism to explain the relationship between changes in happiness and changes in alcohol and
cannabis outcomes (Aim 2). The goal of this proposal is to provide the Applicant with training experiences
that will improve her content area knowledge, analytic skills, grantsmanship and manuscript development,
and network, which are vital to flourishing as an independent researcher. The environment at the University
of Rhode Island, including data analysis software, grant support, and an excellent mentorship team with
expertise in relevant areas, provide the ideal setting for the successful completion of the proposed project."
10903945,"ABSTRACT
The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) orchestrated by advanced malignancies represents a
key driver for tumor progression and a challenge for the successful development of curative immunotherapies.
Multiple pro-inflammatory processes active in the TME induce chronic myelopoiesis and subsequent expansion
of highly immunosuppressive myeloid cells, including Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) subsets, Tumor-
associated macrophages (TAM), and Dendritic cells (DC). To date, however, the approaches to clinically block
the regulatory effects of myeloid cells in tumors are limited to myelosuppressive agents or inhibitors that are only
partially effective. Thus, alternative strategies to overcome the immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic actions
of myeloid cells in cancer are expected to have a significant clinical impact. Infiltration of myeloid cells into tumors
makes them exposed to stress conditions, including hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, and elevated reactive oxygen
and nitrogen species, which trigger overactivation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our recent manuscripts
demonstrated that maladaptive signaling by major arms of the ER stress responses, PERK and Chop, impaired
anti-cancer immunity by intrinsically altering the metabolic and functional activity of myeloid cells in tumor beds.
Notably, our new preliminary results in tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells indicate a potential crosstalk between ER
stress response signals and the activation of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), a process that
ultimately controls mitochondrial homeostasis under stress. Thus, we hypothesize that the chronic overactivation
of PERK→Chop provokes detrimental UPRmt in tumor-linked myeloid cells, which results in a program that allows
mitochondrial adaptation to stress and sustains immune evasion. Also, we postulate that therapeutic targeting
of UPRmt driver LonP1 limits immunosuppressive myelopoiesis, primes protective anti-tumor T cell responses,
and augments the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapy. Thus, proposed studies will unearth for the first time
a mechanistic link between maladaptive ER stress and UPRmt as a central metabolic inhibitory system in tumor-
related myeloid cells, while outlining new strategies to effectively reprogram immunosuppressive myelopoiesis
and to enhance the effects of immunotherapy. We propose the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Determine the role of the activation of the PERK→Chop axis in the induction of UPRmt in tumor-associated
myeloid cells.
Aim 2. Elucidate the role of UPRmt driver LonP1 in the regulatory activity of tumor-linked myeloid cells.
Aim 3. Evaluate whether inhibition of LonP1 augments the effectiveness of cellular- and checkpoint-based
immunotherapies in tumor-bearing hosts."
10903946,"In an animal’s life, a large number of cells undergo apoptosis – cell suicide, to support development
and maintain body homeostasis. In addition, during stroke, cancer, and other traumatic situations, a large
number of cells undergo necrosis after injury. These cells are rapidly internalized by other cells via
phagocytosis (engulfment) and degraded inside engulfing cells. The swift removal of dying cells prevents
tissue injury, inflammatory responses, and auto-immune responses, clears the wounded area, and promotes
tissue repair. Necrosis is also closely associated with neuron degeneration. The phagocytosis of necrotic
neurons and axon debris facilitates the repair and recovery of neuron functions. Phagocytic activity by the
microglia also contribute to the loss of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease. My long-term goal is to understand
how dying cells are specifically recognized, internalized, and degraded by engulfing cells, using the nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. As many physiological mechanisms are highly conserved
throughout evolution, what we learn from C. elegans can be translated to humans. This proposal investigates
the mechanisms that promote the exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), an “eat me” signal, on the surfaces of
necrotic and apoptotic cells to attract engulfing cells. In C. elegans, the necrosis of six mechanosensory
neurons (also called touch neurons) is induced by mutations in a particular group of plasma membrane ion
channel proteins, including the dominant mutations in MEC-4, a subunit of the mechanosensory Na+ channel.
We found that two proteins, the ABC transporter CED-7, and ANOH-1, the worm homolog of the mammalian
phospholipid scramblase TMEM16F, act in parallel to promote PS exposure on the surfaces of necrotic cells.
Recently, we have identified that the exposure of PS on necrotic cells is mediated by cytoplasmic Ca2+.
Furthermore, we discovered two alternative mechanisms that increase Ca2+ level in the cytoplasm, one
dependent on the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the other independent of the ER. In
addition, we have identified multiple genes that act to regulate PS exposure. To further investigate the
molecular mechanism(s) of PS exposure, I propose to determine the novel functions of a transthyretin-like
protein and a proposed PS flippase in promoting the exposure of PS on the surfaces of necrotic cells in
response to the Ca2+ signaling (Aims 1 and 2), and to identify new PS-exposure genes from mutants defective
in the exposure of PS on dying cells that we isolated in a forward genetic screen (Aim 3). Together, the
outcomes will allow us to establish pathways that promote PS exposure in response to upstream signals. They
will also reveal novel molecular mechanisms regulating each step of the process, some of which are
anticipated to be unique to necrotic or apoptotic cells."

10900189,"Among drug users, polysubstance use is much more common than single substance use. One of
the deadliest combinations of substances used in America today is concurrent opioid and
stimulant usage, with co-use of these drugs becoming increasingly responsible for overdose
deaths. Out of the 2.1 million Americans which had an opioid use disorder (OUD) as of 2017, 11%
also had a methamphetamine use disorder. First-time methamphetamine use is more likely after
past-month opioid use. Additional research into the neurobiology of polysubstance use is
essential for the development of targeted, effective treatments for polysubstance addiction.
Addiction behaviors arise from neuroplasticity within the neural circuits responsible for decision -
making, motivation, and reward processing. Individually, stimulants and opioids have different
actions within these circuits, each targeting distinct regions, receptors, and neurotransmitter
systems. Because of this, many of the cellular and molecular adaptations induced by these two
drug classes are unique. Yet, it is unclear how the interaction of these compounds within the
nervous system produces changes in drug-seeking and taking behavior. The proposed study will
explore the neurobehavioral effects of dual opioid and methamphetamine use disorders. The
following Aims will guide the proposed study. AIM 1 is to define the behavioral profile of dual
opioid-methamphetamine use disorders in a rodent model of addiction. Despite its rising
popularity, the underlying behavioral patterns and motivations of polysubstance addiction are not
well characterized. Therefore, the first aim will compare and contrast polysubstance and mono
substance addiction behavioral patterns (i.e. drug-seeking, drug-taking, and reward valuation)
using a reverse-translational rodent self-administration model. AIM 2 is to map neural activation
patterns within the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic (C-BG-T) circuit in response to opioid and
methamphetamine self-administration. Alterations in the C-BG-T networks contribute to addiction
behaviors, as well as the persistence of individual substance use disorders for both opioids and
stimulants. Yet, it is still unclear how chronic, sequential polysubstance use alters neurocircuit
activity. Therefore, the proposed study will map neurocircuit activation patterns with a novel viral-
mediated gene transfer approach for post-mortem tissue analysis, whole brain lightsheet
microscopy, in order to identify differences in C-BG-T network activity between animals with a
history of chronic polysubstance or single substance use. We hypothesize that opioid-stimulant
polysubstance use will have a unique, synergistic effect on addiction-related behaviors and neural
circuit recruitment that is not present when either drug is used alone."

10904805,"Summary
 Inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene is the initiating genetic event in most
clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCCs) and increases the abundance of HIF2α, which drives
ccRCC growth. HIF2α inhibitors are active against some, but not all, VHL-/- ccRCCs in
preclinical models. In the last funding cycle we and others showed that HIF2 inhibitors (e.g.
PT2977) have promising antitumor activity in pretreated ccRCC patients. While the efficacy
signal seen with PT2977 has justified the launch of a pivotal trial that could lead to its regulatory
approval, some ccRCC patients fail to respond to HIF2 blockade. Moreover, the patients that
do respond to PT2977 monotherapy eventually relapse in most cases. We need biomarkers
that identify patients who are likely to respond to HIF2α inhibitors (predictive biomarkers) and to
understand the mechanisms of resistance to such agents. Finally, de novo and acquired
resistance is also a problem with standard of care kidney cancer therapies (e.g. VEGF
inhibitors). We therefore need new therapeutic targets in kidney cancer. Ideally, drugs against
these new targets would be active as single agents and could be combined with existing agents,
with the combinations increasing response rates and decreasing therapeutic resistance.
 Two genes are synthetically lethal with one another when mutation of either gene alone
is tolerated but inactivation of both genes causes cell death. This paradigm has been validated
in the clinic with the activity of PARP inhibitors against BRCA1 mutant tumors. In our last
funding cycle we discovered that VHL and CDK4/6 have a synthetic lethal relationship.
Moreover, we showed that the hyperdependence of VHL-/- ccRCC cells was NOT driven by
HIF2. In keeping with the latter, we showed that CDK4/6 inhibitors were active against VHL-/-
ccRCCs, irrespective of their HIF2 dependence, and enhanced the activity of PT2977 against
HIF2-dependent VHL-/- ccRCC.
 In aim 1 of this proposal we will conduct a phase 1/2 trial of the CDK4/6 inhibitor
abemaciclib, alone and in combination with PT2977. In aim 2 we will search for additional
genes that are synthetic lethal with VHL. We will leverage our ability to do synthetic lethal
screens in both human cells and drosophila cells as a means of identifying genetic interactions
that are likely to be robust. In aim 3 we will use genetic approaches to identify the mechanisms
by which cells become resistant to HIF2 inhibitors. This aim could eventually yield new ways of
predicting which ccRCC patients will respond to HIF2 inhibitors as well as new ways to
circumvent resistance."
10904809,"Summary:
Anti-PD-1-based therapies have transformed the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma
(RCC), leading to durable responses in a subset of patients. Despite this progress, the optimal
therapeutic strategy (anti-PD-1 monotherapy versus dual checkpoint inhibition and dual
checkpoint inhibition versus VEGF and PD-1 inhibition) for individual patients remains unclear, and
too many patients still do not receive durable benefit from any of the PD-1 blockade-based therapies.
Moving forward, the critical challenges are (i) how to best match a patient to an immunotherapy
regimen, and (ii) understanding the key drivers and resistors of anti-RCC immunity following
PD-1 blockade. Our unique access to a rich collection of samples from several front-line PD-1-
blockade-based clinical trials and our comprehensive immunopathology and immunogenomics tool-
kit for deeply dissecting the biologic features tumor cells and the immune microenvironment,
uniquely position our group to address these challenges. To achieve the next paradigm shift in the
treatment of patients with RCC, we hypothesize that an improved understanding of the
expression state of RCC cells and their immune microenvironment at baseline provides
critical information that will uncover targets for novel therapies and will rationally guide PD-1
blockade-based combinatorial therapy. We aim to clarify first-line therapy decisions by developing
biomarkers for durable benefit from anti-PD-1 monotherapy, nivolumab/ipilimumab and axitinib/
pembrolizumab combination therapy using existing tissue collections, and then explore/confirm
the value of these markers in the context of prospective phase III trials comparing the
nivolumab/ipilimumab combination to either nivolumab monotherapy or axitinib/pembrolizumab.
Ultimately, our efforts to establish a predictive model of durable benefit will help determine the
appropriate RCC population to receive PD-1/CTLA-4 or PD-1/VEGF blockade, as well as unveil
those patients who receive equal benefit from anti-PD-1 monotherapy or who require a different
therapeutic approach. Moreover, we will use complementary analyses across patient samples
to comprehensively characterize immune cell composition and functional state, determine target
tumor antigens, and specific TCRs that mediate an effective anti-tumor response in RCC with
the goal of ultimately developing novel immunotherapy approaches that enhance or induce specific
and effective anti-tumor immunity. This work has the potential to optimize the application of
currently effective anti-PD-1-based therapies for patients with advanced RCC and to provide new
and effective immunotherapy approaches for those destined to not benefit optimally from current
regimens."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent worldwide, and accounts for a third of the total number of deaths caused by HIV/AIDS. Understanding the role of alcohol in new TB infection, occurrence of active TB disease, and lung disease after TB treatment in the context of HIV infection is vital to reducing the risks of TB morbidity and mortality among PLWH. The theme of the International URBAN Alcohol Research Collaboration on HIV/AIDS (URBAN ARCH) Center is to understand the impact of alcohol on the spectrum of TB infection among PLWH. The International URBAN ARCH Center will continue to build on its experience in establishing and maintaining cohorts of PLWH in Uganda and will evaluate research questions uniquely addressable in this location. This global research is aligned with the NIH Office of AIDS Research’s highest priorities for HIV and HIV-related research (i.e., addressing HIV-associated comorbidities, coinfections, and complications). The Administrative (Admin) Core will provide the organizational framework for the International URBAN ARCH Center and will facilitate synergy among the Center’s 4 components: 1) Admin Core; 2) Biostatistics and Data Management (BDM) Core; 3) Research Project 1, TRAC study; and 4) Research Project 2, PTLD study. The Admin Core will be responsible for day-to-day management and functioning of the Center with the goal of ensuring that the scientific and programmatic activities of the Center are integrated and carried out with high quality and timeliness. The Admin Core will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Promote a collaborative, synergistic approach to research goals; 2) Facilitate communication, integration, and collaboration between all Center components; 3) Coordinate access to resources including the International URBAN ARCH Center data and sample repository; 4) Assess and foster components’ progress and quality to maximize the scientific impact of the Center; 5) Encourage the sharing of data with investigators within the Center and beyond; and 6) Develop future leadership of the Center and the next generation of HIV/alcohol researchers. Under the leadership of the Admin Core and with its expert facilitation and research management, the International URBAN ARCH Center will generate new generalizable knowledge about the complex relationship between TB, HIV, and alcohol use in order to accelerate the future development of interventions that can reduce alcohol’s impact on TB-related morbidity and mortality among PLWH. The success of the International URBAN ARCH Center is critically dependent on the Admin Core’s scientific and administrative leadership to ensure that all components function optimally and synergistically."

10901290,"-Project Summary-
 As neurons grow, their dendrites develop a unique structure and the ability to perform computations that are
essential for nervous system function. Research studying dendritic maturation has largely focused on mechanisms that
shape the morphology of the cell but understanding how this structural development relates to the functional development
of the dendrite is critical. To that end, I propose investigating dendritic development in a model that allows me to measure
functional and structural maturation independently: starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the mouse retina. SACs are
axonless interneurons that have radially symmetric dendrites extending out from the soma. Each branch has a primary
dendrite proximal to the soma that receives glutamatergic input from bipolar cells, then branches out in the distal regions
where neurotransmitter is released at output synapses marked by varicosities. Functionally, each branch acts as a direction
of motion detector; varicosities preferentially release neurotransmitters in response to visual stimuli moving away from
the soma. Thus, each branch is an independent computational unit that relays directional information to postsynaptic
partners. When and how SAC dendrites develop this functional property is unknown, but there is some evidence to
suggest it may happen independently of the morphological development of the cell. Thus, I propose to test the hypothesis
that distinct mechanisms underlie structural and functional maturation of SAC dendrites.
 In Aim 1, I will map the time course of both structural and functional development of SACs and determine the
extent to which structural maturity predicts functional maturity. In Aim 2, I will use targeted manipulations to identify
mechanisms that dictate this developmental timeline. In Aim 2.1 I will test the hypothesis that SAC functional maturation
relies on spontaneous activity during development (retinal waves) and an intracellular protein called FRMD7. Mice
without retinal waves and mice with mutations in the FRMD7 gene both show deficits in direction selective circuit
function that relies on proper SAC function. Additionally, both models lack normal optokinetic reflexes, a phenotype that
was shown to arise from faulty retinal direct selective circuits and is shared with human patients who have FRMD7-
related nystagmus. Thus, both models are clinically relevant and promising candidates to reveal mechanisms of functional
SAC development.
 FRMD7 is thought to interact with proteins involved in activity-dependent synaptic protein trafficking, and the
location of glutamate synapses on SAC dendrites contributes to their direction-selective output. In Aim 2.2, I will use
glutamate uncaging to test the hypothesis that disrupting retinal waves and FRMD7 expression is decreasing direction
selectivity by interfering with the trafficking of excitatory receptors to their correct location on the SAC dendrite.
Together, these experiments provide insight into how dendrites acquire the ability to compute information and contribute
to circuit function, as well as elucidating how changes in such developmental mechanisms can lead to circuit dysfunction."

During the pandemic, children's technology and digital media (TDM) use, and in particular tablet use, has increased dramatically. Greater TDM use has been associated with less healthy sleep habits including shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing, difficulty falling asleep, and poorer sleep quality. This is concerning as shorter sleep duration, later sleep timing, and poorer sleep quality in childhood have been linked with the development of obesity and associated conditions, poorer executive functioning (EF) and academic performance, and increased risk for anxiety and depression in adolescence. One of the most likely mechanisms through which TDM use affects sleep is through the contribution of evening light exposure. Exposure to light at night sends an alerting signal to the circadian system, signaling that it is daytime, suppressing the release of melatonin, a hormone that signals to the body that it is time to sleep. The pervasive use of mobile devices (e.g., tablets) among children may pose an even greater impact on children's circadian system due to the closeness of the device to the eye. To mitigate risks associated with TDM use and sleep problems, parents need practical guidance about the potential impact of TDM use on their children's circadian rhythms and sleep, especially in the evening when children are most sensitive to the light emitted from screen devices. The goal of Project 3 is to systematically test the effect of TDM use before bed on the sleep, circadian phase, and EF of 4-year-olds using a 3-group randomized controlled trial in which children are assigned to receive one of 2 experimental conditions (Group A:1 hour of tablet use in the hour before bed; Group 8: 1 hour of tablet use 2 hours before bed) or a control condition (no evening TOM use). The proposed research addresses several gaps in scientific knowledge regarding the impact and timing of evening TDM use in the home environment. First, the impact of the timing of TDM use relative to bedtime in children is unknown. Second, the extent to which evening TDM use affects children's circadian phase, sleep, and executive functioning above and beyond the effects of household lighting is unknown. Our findings will address these gaps in the literature and have direct implications on the guidelines for evening TDM use among children. Our novel ability to objectively assess and control for children's daytime TOM use and assess treatment fidelity using FLASH-TV and apps for assessing tablet use allows us to conduct this experimental study in the home environment. Due to these innovations, the proposed study will be the first to: 1) translate experimental research methods from the laboratory to the home environment to examine the impact of evening light exposure on children's circadian physiology; 2) examine the impact of evening TDM use in the home environment on the circadian timing of preschoolers; 3) systematically test the effects of evening TDM use in the home environment on children's sleep onset and duration; and 4) explore the role of evening TDM use in the home environment on children's EF (inhibitory control and working memory)."

The 2024 FASEB SRC entitled “Regulation and Function of Small GTPases” represents the latest iteration of a
long-standing conference on GTPase biology that first took place in 1991. Small GTPases are binary switches
that interconvert from the GDP-bound “off” to the GTP-bound “on” state by receptors and regulatory molecules
and, when in the on state, drive signaling through various effector molecules. This conference provides broad
coverage of the RAS superfamily of GTPases that number more than 160 members and are divided into five
families: RAS, RHO, RAB, ARF, and RAN. RAS was the first small GTPase identified and remains the best
studied. Given its oncogenic activation in nearly 20% of human tumors, RAS has garnered intense interest as a
pharmacological target. Once deemed “undruggable”, the recent deployment of two FDA-approved RAS
inhibitors to the clinic has now dispelled this idea. With the involvement of other small GTPases in tumorigenesis,
interest is growing in the pharmacological inhibition of additional members of this important superfamily of signal
transducers. The FASEB SRC on Small GTPases continues the tradition of past meetings in bringing together
the leaders in the field along with trainees and those new to the area to share exciting new findings that will drive
the field forward and promote collaborations that expedite the development of new therapies. In addition, the
meeting provides numerous training and career development opportunities for trainees, early career scientists,
and clinicians. This application seeks partial funding for the 2024 FASEB SRC entitled “Regulation and Function
of Small GTPases”. The meeting will feature Keynote Lectures from Drs. Anne Ridley and Mark Philips, two
leaders in GTPase biology. In addition, there will be 27 plenary talks. Twenty-one short talks will be selected from
submitted abstracts and delivered by young scientists. All attendees will present posters. Opportunities for
informal discussions and for networking will abound over the 4-day meeting that will include unscheduled time
in the afternoons as well as Meet-the-Expert lunches, and a Career Development workshop. Thirty-five percent
of invited speakers are new to the conference and will infuse new perspective and technologies. Thirty-eight
percent of the invited speakers are women as are half of the session chairs and one of the organizers. While
three invited speakers are from underrepresented groups, a concerted effort is planned to recruit additional
speakers and trainees who are members of underrepresented groups. Ten travel/registration awards will be
made to trainees with preference given to underrepresented minorities."

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a painful and debilitating sequela for many cancer
patients. For some patients this complication prevents optimal therapy and so jeopardizes the chance for a
cure, while many patients develop permanent, untreatable pain and severe sensory deficits that seriously
compromise quality of life for cancer patients and survivors. The mechanisms that cause axon degeneration
and sensory symptoms in CIPN are just beginning to be defined, and it is not yet clear whether the
mechanisms that underlie CIPN can be biologically resolved from anti-neoplastic efficacy of chemotherapy.
Against this backdrop, our previous studies under this grant have demonstrated a central role for increased
axonal Ca+2 and activation of Ca+2-dependent calpain proteases in CIPN. Building on these findings we will
identify the processes linking together 1) the direct effects of paclitaxel or other chemotherapies on
microtubules, 2) activation of molecules implicated in axon destruction, plus the loss of compounds that
promote axon survival and 3) opening of Ca+2 channels located within the long axons. Our studies make use
of rodent sensory neurons in compartmented cultures, immunocompetent mice with paclitaxel-sensitive breast
cancer, and new human iPSC-derived sensory neuron cultures prepared from patients with severe CIPN or
from patients resistant to CIPN. Using these innovative approaches we will identify therapeutic targets for
treating CIPN without compromising the anti-neoplastic efficacy of paclitaxel and we will develop novel
therapeutic compounds. Since the process of axon degeneration in CIPN is similar to that seen in diseases
including hereditary neuropathy, ALS, and Alzheimer’s disease, our insights and therapeutic approaches will
advance treatment for many additional debilitating diseases."

The objective of our competing renewal application for the Univ of Chicago Research Training Program in
Respiratory Biology is to prepare young scientists to pursue research careers addressing mechanisms and
treatment of human disease, with a focus on respiratory pathobiology. The cohesiveness of this interdiscipli-
nary Program stems from the highly collaborative nature of our 38 well-funded faculty in 7 departments and the
Institute for Molecular Engineering at the Univ of Chicago in multiple areas of concentration. Studies in Asthma
and Airway Physiology/Immunology continue to focus on airway inflammation, airway smooth muscle and
epithelial structure and function, B-cell and T-cell activation, asthma genetics, and clinical investigation. These
complement programs of Studies in Lung Immunology and Transplantation that focus on cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying transplantation immunology and their translational applications to patients, and
translational Studies in Interstitial Lung Diseases that draw on one of the largest dedicated clinics in the
Midwest. A Concentration in Airway and Mucosal Microbiome adds this critically important emerging research
direction to the asthma and ILD programs. Studies in Critical Illness and Acute Lung Injury continue to address
subcellular determinants of oxygen sensing and consumption, cellular responses to hypoxia, membrane
biology, endothelial and epithelial barrier function, and bedside translations to patients with sepsis,
cardiopulmonary arrest, and sleep disturbance. Complementing these are cross-cutting Studies in Genetics
and Epigenetics and Concentration in Health Studies and Ethics. The Program Directors are Anne I. Sperling,
PhD and Julian Solway, MD, with Associate Director Steven White, MD (Mentorship and Career Development).
Christopher Olopade, MD, MPH chairs a Diversity Committee. Internal and External Advisors provide oversight
and continuity of review, and an Admissions/Steering Committee reviews trainee progress. We request funding
for 10 post-doctoral trainees. PhD, MD, and MD/PhD trainees are enrolled and trained together. Collaboration
of basic and clinical scientists on research further enhances the integrative and translational nature of our
program. All fellows perform full-time research for at least 2 years, and MD fellows will devote not more than
10% time to clinical training while supported by this Program. Training consists of 5 major components:
a Research Project performed under the direct supervision of faculty co-mentors; a Core Curriculum of robust
seminar series and courses with additional, tailored formal coursework; Core Competencies that includes
scientific communication, grant writing, and mentoring; Multidisciplinary Research; and Individualized Career
Development Planning. Prior trainees from this Program have developed successful independent research
careers in large proportion. Refinements presented here should further enhance the likelihood for success of
future trainees."

10875108,"Program Summary/Abstract-Overall
 With the advent of the National Alzheimer’s Project Act of 2011, funding and support to advance the
science of dementia care has increased substantially. There now exists significant research infrastructure to
support basic research on dementia care, intervention development and testing, and the integration of
dementia care interventions into healthcare systems. However, if the science of dementia care is to progress
towards the later stages of the NIH Stage Model, the development of scalable innovations that are more readily
disseminated and primed for implementation across settings (including homes and within community
organizations) is needed. One way to do so is to better understand why dementia care interventions work. The
primary objective of the Establishing Mechanisms of Benefit to Reinforce the Alzheimer’s Care
Experience AD/ADRD Roybal Center (EMBRACE) is to provide scientific infrastructure to support the
testing of mechanisms in tailored home and community dementia care intervention trials across
Stages 0-V of the NIH Stage Model. The Aims of EMBRACE are as follows: 1) Leverage the extensive
expertise of EMBRACE to attract and support early stage to expert Investigators to test mechanistically driven
dementia care interventions across the NIH Stage Model; 2) Advance the science of testing mechanisms of
tailored dementia care interventions in home and community settings; and 3) Conduct a robust evaluation of
EMBRACE to ensure appropriate progress of supported trials.
 The science of dementia care interventions is at a crossroads. Despite significant infrastructure
investments on the part of the National Institute on Aging and other federal agencies, very few Stage I-III trials
have successfully progressed to subsequent effectiveness (Stage IV) and dissemination and implementation
(Stage V) testing in the NIH Stage Model. By relying on its national network of collaboration between the
University of Minnesota (Multiple Principal Investigator/MPI: Gaugler), the University of Wisconsin-Madison
(MPI Gilmore-Bykovskyi), and the NIA IMPACT Collaboratory (Behavioral Intervention Development Core Co-
Leads Hodgson and Gitlin well as six EMBRACE faculty), the proposed AD/ADRD Roybal Center will provide
unparalleled consultation and support throughout the lifecycle of intervention development and create
academic, scientific, and educational resources to guide the testing of mechanisms in dementia care
interventions across the NIH Stage Model."
10875109,"Program Summary/Abstract-Administrative Core
 Robust research infrastructure capable of advancing the science of dementia care interventions in the
home and community is necessary. Such infrastructure should reflect the integration of concentrated and
synergistic areas of scientific expertise encompassing all components of the NIH Stage Model, dementia care
interventions, community engagement, and recruitment and retention. Our proposed AD/ADRD Roybal Center,
Establishing Mechanisms of Benefit to Reinforce the Alzheimer’s Care Experience (EMBRACE), addresses
this need by assembling an interdisciplinary team that synergizes these areas of expertise to establish a strong
research infrastructure to facilitate the science of mechanistically driven dementia care interventions.
 The primary objective of the Administrative Core (AC) is to provide governance, oversight, and systematic
coordination of activities of EMBRACE. The AC will provide focused leadership and structure for all EMBRACE
activities including its solicitation, review, awarding, and monitoring of clinical trials; coordination of the External
Advisory Committee (EAC); evaluation of the overall Center and progression of awarded Investigators;
coordination with the Roybal Coordinating Center to advance the overall mission of NIA’s Roybal Program; and
dissemination and network building with other Roybal and NIA-funded Centers. Together, these activities will
cultivate a vibrant community of scientists engaged in testing mechanisms of action in dementia care
interventions as emphasized in RFA-AG-24-007. The Specific Aims of the EMBRACE Administrative Core are
to: 1) Provide governance and administration of EMBRACE; 2) Support the scientific activities and functions of
EMBRACE by coordinating solicitation and review of applications with the Behavioral Intervention
Development Core; and 3) Facilitate the development of research networks and collaborations within and
beyond EMBRACE that advances a mechanistic science of dementia care interventions. In accomplishing
these Aims, EMBRACE will in turn achieve its objective of generating extensive and substantive research
capacity to advance the development and advancement of potent and mechanistically oriented dementia care
interventions in home and community settings across the NIH Stage Model."
10892995,"Care delivery for patients with cancer is a high-risk, high-volume, and high-cost endeavor. In the United
States, over 1.6 million adults received new diagnoses of invasive cancer in 2016 and prevalence is expected
to reach 19 million Americans by 2024. The National Academy of Medicine, among others, have raised
persistent questions regarding the quality of care patients receive across the cancer care continuum. Rapid
and impressive advances in cancer therapies may be rendered moot if such therapies cannot be given in a
safe, effective, efficient, equitable, and patient-centered manner across diverse treatment settings. Given the
pervasive challenges to optimal cancer care delivery, additional research capacity is needed to hasten the
discovery of care gaps, develop and test efficacious interventions, and implement discoveries into routine
clinical practice. The proposed training will prepare scientists from diverse disciplines to advance this needed
research and to understand and improve cancer care delivery, thus filling a critical void in cancer research.
 The goal of this new T32 application, Interdisciplinary Research Training in Cancer Care Delivery, is to
prepare three pre and 14 postdoctoral trainees to become independent scientists who conduct cancer care
delivery research across three emphasis areas: 1) descriptive discovery; 2) intervention development and
testing, and; 3) implementation science. The program will produce independent scientists by providing a solid
foundation in research methods and pertinent theory, depth of knowledge in a substantive science area
pertinent to cancer care delivery, experience in the conduct of research, and socialization into the normative
behavior of high quality, ethically sensitive research. Training is provided through four main activities: mentored
research experiences, course work, a selected emphasis area, and professional development and
socialization. Trainees will have an individualized development plan and a mentorship team composed of a
primary mentor with an active research program in cancer care delivery and a secondary mentor with content
and/or methodological expertise. Across six top-ranked graduate schools – Engineering, Nursing, Medicine,
Pharmacy, Public Health, and Social Work – 22 primary and 10 secondary faculty with cancer care delivery
research expertise have pledged to mentor trainees. The University of Michigan provides an outstanding
environment to support cancer care delivery research training. Key institutional assets include the Rogel
Cancer Center, the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation, the Michigan Institute for Data Science, and
the Institute for Social Research. The University of Michigan School of Nursing, a top ten program, will house
the program and implement robust strategies to recruit and retain a diverse pool of trainees.
 This training program aligns with stated priorities of the National Cancer Institute and the Moonshot Blue
Ribbon Panel Recommendations to lessen the burden of cancer through minimizing cancer treatment’s
debilitating side effects, expand prevention and early detection, and mine data to predict patient outcomes."
10892996,"Abstract
The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to build long-lasting tumor-specific immunologic ‘memory’ in patients that
enables the lifelong rejection of tumors. The two prominent types of antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy,
adoptive T cell therapy and APC-based vaccination, both require expansion of anti-tumor T cells via APCs.
However, for the purpose of effective adoptive T cell therapy, the critical question is how to generate, within a
short period of time, large numbers of antitumor T cells. Furthermore, in vitro-expanded T cells must also possess
the capacity to engraft, proliferate, and persist in vivo with sufficient antitumor function to induce sustained
antitumor activity. Autologous antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as DCs also have several serious limitations.
The necessity to access large amounts of cancer patients’ blood to prepare autologous APC from each patient
in a timely manner is cumbersome. To overcome these problems, we developed the microfluidic process to
generate cell-sized unilamellar vesicles (CUVs) and decorated them with antigen presenting ligands for artificial
APCs (or aAPCs). Preliminary results show that aAPCs are able to bind and interact with T cells and cause their
expansion. The objective of the present proposal is to further optimize the aAPCs preparation and test its
capacity to induce tumor specific responses in vitro and in vivo. The hypothesis is that the optimized aAPC
functionalization will result in enhanced expansion of cytotoxic CD8 T cells and a reduction in tumor progression
over the present one (original). The Specific Aims are- 1) Bioinspired optimization of artificial antigen presenting
cell (aAPC) production via microfluidic engineering. We will insert the antigen presenting ligands in the
membrane to mimic cells. The aAPCs will also be produced with hydrogel cytoskeletons to optimize its
mechanical properties for maximum T cell expansion. 2) Evaluation of the capacity of aAPCs to induce tumor
specific T cell responses in vitro. Using PBMCs from healthy donors and breast cancer patients we will evaluate
the capacity of aAPCs to induce cytotoxic T cells. 3) Evaluation of the capacity of aAPCs to induce T cell
responses and tumor killing with an in vivo mice tumor model. Methods to scale up the production of aAPCs for
in vivo use will be developed. The capacity of aAPCs to kill tumor in vivo in mice will also be determined using a
melanoma model. The goal is to produce an aAPC preparation that mimics cells, is stable, easy to produce in
large quantities and capable of expanding tumor specific CD8 T cells for immunotherapy of cancer."
10893301,"Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell disorder that accounts for ~10% of all hematologic malignancies.
Due to high production of IgG in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), MM cells continuously undergo ER stress which is
considered an “Achille’s heel” of the disease. This feature makes MM susceptible to the agents that exacerbate
ER stress, such as proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Yet, currently MM is incurable for most patients due to
rapidly emerging resistance to proteasome inhibitors. Therefore, identification of novel anti-MM drugs and
targets is of high importance.
 Conversely, an increase in protein export from ER is a part of the adaptive response to ER stress. In the
current application, we propose a novel clinically relevant pathway controlling ER homeostasis and resistance
to bortezomib in MM via modulation of sphingolipid composition of the ER membrane. Our preliminary data
suggest that such modulation affects ER-to-Golgi transport, ER homeostasis and ultimately MM cell viability.
Furthermore, we identified 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases (HACD3), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis
of very long fatty acids (VLCFA), as an important regulator of ER-to-Golgi export and ER homeostasis.
Importantly, HACD3 mRNA levels were increased during MM progression and in MM cells from MM patients
refractory to bortezomib-containing therapy.
 Therefore, in Specific Aim 1, we will functionally characterize mechanisms underlying VLCFA-dependent
regulation of ER homeostasis and characterize enzymes upstream and downstream of HACD3 responsible for
such regulation. In Specific Aim 2, we will identify mechanisms regulating HACD3 mRNA expression in MM cells.
In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological suppression of VLCFAs in MM mouse models."
10893367,"This proposal presents a research career development program focused on the study of alcohol’s
dose-dependent effects in neuroinflammation in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), experimental
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). I am currently an assistant professor of neurology at Dell Medical
School at UT Austin. The outlined proposal builds on my previous research in neurobiology of sex
differences, clinical training in neuroimmunology and integrates new domains of expertise in bioinformatics,
alcohol and microbiome research, and basic science neuroimmunology. I will be guided by outstanding
mentors and advisors, including Drs. Adron Harris (alcohol research), Hans Hofmann (bioinformatics),
Sergio Baranzini (microbiome), Olaf Stuve (neuroimmunology), and William Schwartz (career guidance).
The proposed experiments, didactics, and mentorship will enable me to transition to an R01 funded
physician scientist in the cross disciplinary field of neuroimmunology and alcohol research.
 MS is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and the
leading acquired cause of neurological disability in young adults. The cause of MS is unknown. Although
genes contribute to the disease risk, it is thought that environmental factors, such as diet and the gut
microbiome contribute to a larger degree of the risk. Alcohol is a common dietary factor used by MS
patients. Yet, despite its widespread use, potential for abuse and known gut, CNS and immune effects,
alcohol’s role in MS is not well understood. The foundation of this proposal is based on my preliminary
studies, in press in PNAS, demonstrating that moderate alcohol consumption leads to EAE amelioration,
decrease in microglia in the spinal cord, and a shift of gut microbiota toward a regulatory phenotype in a
sex-specific pattern, that collectively suggest a protective role of moderate alcohol in EAE and potentially in
MS. Given known pro-inflammatory effects of alcohol, these studies raise the question of alcohol’s possible
differential effects on neuroinflammation at high vs moderate doses. This proposal begins to address this
question by evaluating alcohol’s dose-dependent effects on the peripheral and CNS immune system and
the gut microbiome. Specifically, the aims of this proposal are (1) What are the peripheral and CNS immune
cell subsets driving dose-dependent alcohol effects in EAE? Can adoptive transfer from alcohol-consuming
mice recapitulate clinical symptoms in naive mice? and (2) Which gut microbiome constituents are
responsible for alcohol’s dose-dependent effects in EAE? Can microbiome transfer from alcohol-consuming
mice recapitulate clinical symptoms in naive mice? The scientific objective of this proposal is to begin to
define alcohol’s dose-dependent effects in neuroinflammation by examining the immune system and the gut
microbiome with the vision of generating hypotheses that can inform the direction and design of future diet
studies in EAE and MS and expand the repertoire of available and targeted probiotics for MS patients."
10893517,"ABSTRACT
The cell-to-cell connections that comprise the functional circuitry and global network organization of the human
brain have at their root precise spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression that differentiate brain regions, cell
types, and developmental periods. Recent discoveries have revealed highly dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of
gene expression throughout development and in several regions of the brain, but elucidating the neural
connectome – the comprehensive map of all neural connections – at multiple ages of human development has,
until recently, not been practical. Consequently, although we now have a strong understanding of transcriptional
reorganizations in the developing and adult human brain, how these dynamics mediate other key phenomena
essential for brain function, such as neural connectivity, is not well understood. As region-specific disruptions to
neural connectivity may underlie neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and autism spectrum
disorder, the association of transcriptome information with connectivity is a critical next frontier for analysis. We
therefore propose to integrate human brain connectome based on neural MRI and transcriptome data collected
across multiple timepoints in human postnatal development with unprecedented spatial resolution to implicate
candidate genes, gene expression modules, brain regions, developmental periods, and connectivity patterns
with human brain development. To accomplish this, we will develop a high-resolution connectome atlas
established with unique existing developmental and adult data as well as next-generation connectome data from
early and late childhood being acquired with other sources. This atlas will be paired with transcriptomic atlas
from the postnatal human neocortex consisting of 25 neocortical areas and will be integrated with publicly
available, less comprehensive transcriptomic data generated at the level of the single cell. Finally, we will validate
gene expression patterns and the associations we reveal, and freely disseminate atlases and datasets through
an integrated web portal."
10893518,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising surrogate for tissue biopsy, potentially enabling
non-invasive, real-time cancer monitoring. Most cancer cells release large numbers of EVs into circulation that
carry molecular constituents reflective of the heterogeneity of the parent tumor. This project is designed to
optimize a liquid biopsy to diagnose malignant glioma tumors. Currently, such tumors are diagnosed through a
brain tissue biopsy which involves considerable risk for patients and doesn’t allow for longitudinal follow up of
clinical care. Current EV isolation and characterization methods yield inconsistent results and render data
reproducibility challenging, often leading to unpredictable conclusions. The ​goals​ of this project are to i)
address variability among the different EV isolation methods and platforms currently available, and to ii)
pinpoint to the “best” method to validate candidate biomarkers for glioma diagnosis. Our exceptional
investigative team brings together experts in malignant glioma treatment, the field of nano-engineering,
vesicular research, assay development and droplet digital PCR technology to optimize the necessary
elements for the development of a blood-based assay capable of moving towards clinical settings. Through a
simple blood test, clinicians will be able to diagnose, stratify and monitor a tumor without the need for tissue
biopsy. Our strategic partnership with ​Exosome Diagnostics​, an industry leader in EV-based cancer
diagnostics, offers us venues allowing for the translation of our findings, coupled with access to clinical grade
kits, platforms and study design. The D​ epartment of Neurosurgery​ and the ​Center for Systems Biology​ at the
Massachusetts General Hospital comprise multidisciplinary clinical expertise, innovative technologies and
complementary resources to carry out the following translational projects: ​First,​ based on our prior kit
comparison work, we have picked two top EV isolation kits and enrichment platforms to test in a series of well
controlled, reference standards to determine an optimal EV isolation method. ​Second,​ we will test whether EV
gene signatures can be used as biomarkers for cancer detection as well as tracking recurrence. By following
quality control on device design and sample processing, accruing well-annotated patient and control samples,
and performing multi site testing, we will ​ensure assay reliability and reproducibility​ to deliver clinically
translatable EV diagnostics. Fourteen genes were selected through literature data mining based on the
putative evidence that they can distinguish gliomas from controls. ​Finally,​ a gene’s signature with the highest
sensitivity and specificity will be validated in a large cohort of patient samples. The technical and scientific
outcomes of this research could have a significant ​translational impact in gliomas​, establishing a robust,
highly specific assay to guide treatment decision and assess tumor recurrence."

Candidate: I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Dr. Ross Levine in the Human Oncology & Pathogenesis
Program at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC). My PhD studies allowed me to hone the technical
and experimental skills required for interrogating clinically tractable molecular dependencies in cancer cells. My
current research focuses on the generation of models of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) evolution to be used in
the discovery of novel molecular dependencies and potential therapeutic targets. To that end, I have broadened
my capabilities with CRISPR editing to generate an inducible AML model that allows for temporal control of
mutagenesis and optimized a single cell DNA sequencing technique to evaluate the clonal framework of AML.
My proposed research will build upon these initial studies to develop a new suite of sequential mutagenesis
models of AML. These models developed in the K99 phase of this grant will serve as tools for the discovery of
essential proteins/pathways for leukemic cells. My long-term career goal is to lead an independent research
group focused on the identification and characterization of molecular dependencies of AML using precise models
of disease evolution through sequential mutagenesis. To accomplish these goals, I have outlined a career plan
that will 1) expand of my technical skills and scientific capacity, 2) improve my scientific communications with
the field, 3) advance my supervisory and leadership abilities, 4) develop and foster collaborative relationships
and 5) prepare me for the transition to independence.
Project: Molecular profiling studies of AML patients infer a progressive acquisition of mutations that drives
leukemogenesis, but are unable to delineate the dominant clonal framework leading to disease or identify the
precise mutational order for certain genes, such as NPM1. Current models of AML are unable to truly recapitulate
the step-wise mutagenesis observed in patients. Our single cell sequencing studies have further resolved the
clonal structure of AML at single cell resolution and with these studies, I aim to generate new models that
accurately depict the sequential mutagenesis of AML evolution. The specific aims are: 1) examine mechanisms
of co-mutational clonal dominance and mutation order in AML patients using single cell profiling, 2) determine
the impact of mutational acquisition on disease development and progression of NPM1-mutant AML, and 3)
elucidate molecular dependencies of disease derived from mutant NPM1 and co-occurring mutations.
Environment: The Levine lab is part of the MSKCC Molecular Cancer Medicine Service, Human Oncology &
Pathogenesis Program (HOPP), for which Dr. Levine is Chief. The Levine lab is a core member of the Center for
Hematologic Malignancies and the Center for Epigenetics Research, directed by Dr. Abdel-Wahab and Dr.

greatest value-added to the larger scientific community. The centerpiece of the Core is the provision of multiple
workshops, involving invited experts, project investigators, and users of the publicly available data, to examine
integrative pathways using complex methods and shared measures, targeted toward fully exploiting the multi-
wave, multi-cohort MIDUS survey data, and its novel genetic, biomarker and neuroimaging data. Specifically,
the Core will (1) Promote maximal use of complex multi-faceted MIDUS longitudinal data. The Statistics Core
will organize workshops focused on relevant methodological and data analytic issues addressing four themes:
(a) advanced statistical methods that exploit the longitudinal data to address study aims; (b) the use and
analysis of new genetic, biomarker, and neuroscience data; (c) analytic challenges shared across the projects
(e.g., missing data techniques such as multiple imputation); and (d) substantive and conceptual challenges
that unify the projects (e.g., conceptualization, analysis, and modeling age-period-and cohort effects).
Selection of specific topics is an ongoing and iterative process, designed to meet the evolving needs of the
MIDUS investigators and user community. (2) Facilitate cross-study science. The Statistics Core will facilitate
and guide cross-study comparisons with other major longitudinal studies. The Core leaders will demonstrate
how to carry out multi-study comparisons and advise data users on the best ways to deploy MIDUS in such
integrative analyses. We will borrow the tools of meta-analysis to use MIDUS within multi-study frameworks.
We will also use and advise data users on methodologies such as random effect meta-analysis, which permit
the consideration of study-level variables to explain differences among findings. (3) Provide analytic guidance
in analysis of historical context effects. The Stats Core will provide illustrative guidance and statistical
consultation on data analyses that exploit opportunities afforded by the MIDUS design to examine long-term
impacts of the Great Recession, and more recently, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical,
psychological, economic, and social well-being of MIDUS participants. The objective is to assist investigators
with analyses that compare outcomes before and after the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, both
offering natural experimental designs of within-person change."
10894194,"ABSTRACT – SURVEY PROJECT
The primary goals of the Survey Project are to collect a 2nd wave of survey data on the Refresher sample
(MR2) (projected N = 2,655, 65% retention rate) and a 4th wave of data on the Core sample (M4) (projected N
= 2,578, 70% retention rate). Included in both endeavors is follow-up of the Milwaukee samples of African
Americans. All respondents will complete a phone interview (or personal interview for Milwaukee) and self-
administered questionnaires, as were fielded in previous waves. Assessments include standard
sociodemographics as well as comprehensive measures of physical and mental health, assessments of
personality and validated psychosocial measures, behavioral factors, and chronic and acute stress exposures.
A primary objective is to obtain new longitudinal data that will allow more precise and reliable estimates of
change in key variables as well as strengthen opportunities for investigating psychosocial factors (negative and
positive) as moderators or mediators of age-related changes in health. The new MR2 and M4 assessments will
afford a window on such changes over 30 years for the Core sample (which began in 1995) and 10 years for
the Refresher sample (which began in 2011). This will allow testing of key hypotheses about resilience and
vulnerability, focused on SES moderators of health disparities as well as moderators of age-related changes in
health. In addition, the next wave will include a new module on the long-term impacts of the COVID-19
pandemic. The module will repurpose and extend prior measures that assessed impacts of the Great
Recession (e.g., changes to employment, finances, family life; new measures of pandemic-specific
experiences, including impact of social distancing on work and family life, differential access to digital
technologies, effects of virus on health of self and significant others). These assessments will be combined
with past information on socioeconomic inequality, life stress exposures, psychosocial risk, and protective
factors to predict unfolding profiles of health and well-being in the context of major historical events. The
Survey Project serves as the hub from which all other projects emanate, making its efficient management of
sample and data collection protocols essential for completing all aims and components of the MIDUS
enterprise within the grant period. MIDUS offers extensive evidence of scientific productivity and public usage
(1,617 publications; 26,000 users), more than half of which is based exclusively on data derived from the
Survey Project."
10894195,"ABSTRACT – DAILY DIARY PROJECT
The objective of the MIDUS Daily Project is to determine how short term fluctuations in daily stress processes
impact longer-term health and well-being throughout midlife and later adulthood. Specific aims are to: (1)
Assess changes in multiple aspects of daily stressors and daily well-being across up to four occasions
spanning up to 30 years and three historic periods; (2) Investigate how disrupted diurnal rhythms of salivary
cortisol provide a physiological mechanism linking daily stress and health; and (3) Add tablet-based mobile
assessments of daily experiences to the MIDUS protocol to enhance daily measurements of stress processes
and capture unique assessments of cognitive health. These aims will be addressed by conducting additional
waves of longitudinal data collection for the MIDUS Core and Refresher Daily projects. We will continue to use
an 8-day telephone diary study of daily stressors and well-being combined with multiple assessments of saliva
(4 occasions × 4 days) to obtain salivary cortisol. In addition, we will add a 14-day tablet data collection
following the daily telephone survey. The MIDUS Daily project will continue to incorporate the rich
sociodemographic, personality, and cognitive measures from other MIDUS projects in our analyses to study
how they relate to changes in daily stress processes over up to 30 years. We will also use data from the gene
expression, biomarker, and neuroscience projects to examine how changes in daily stress processes predict
gene expression profiles and changes in various indicators of health (e.g., allostatic load, inflammatory
processes, neuroendocrine regulation, cardiovascular risk)."
10894198,"ABSTRACT – BIOMARKER PROJECT
The Biomarker Project plays a central role in the MIDUS efforts to understand aging as an integrated
biopsychosocial process. Our prior biomarker data have received widespread engagement from the scientific
community: 403 publications have been generated, 162 of which appeared since 2019. The goal going forward
is to build on this momentum by collecting a 2nd wave of longitudinal data on the Refresher subsample (n=647),
and a 4th wave of longitudinal data on the Core subsamples (n=630), for a total projected N=1,277. We will
repeat our comprehensive battery of biomarkers (neuroendocrine, inflammatory, glucose metabolism,
cardiovascular, musculoskeletal) plus add new measures related to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD), including amyloid beta (Aβ40, Aβ42), neurofilament light (NFL), and P-tau, along with a
new measure of chronic inflammation (suPAR). We will also add the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
and a hearing test. We will investigate hypotheses about the effects of socioeconomic and psychosocial
disadvantage on subsequent change in biology, predicting that those exposed to greater cumulative adversity
will show heightened biological risk over time and greater functional impairment. We will also investigate the
role of psychosocial resources in moderating (mitigating) against the adverse health consequences of
socioeconomic and racial disparities. We will exploit the MIDUS design involving two national samples (Core,
Refresher) unfolding in time to examine widening socioeconomic status differential in health outcomes in
same-aged groups across different historical periods. Included in these analyses will be stress exposures
related to the Great Recession (previously assessed) and newly assessed hardships of the COVID-19
pandemic. Viewed comparatively, three key features distinguish the MIDUS Biomarker Project from other U.S.
studies. First, it will provide 3 waves of biological data over 20 years in the Core national sample and 2 waves
of biological data over 10 years in the Refresher national sample, all obtained on mid-life adults at baseline.
Second, the biomarkers collected in MIDUS are far richer than any other U.S. population-based sample. Third,
the extensive survey data of MIDUS – encompassing decades of prospective information on socioeconomic,
psychosocial, and behavioral aspects of participants’ lives -- provide unique opportunities for testing how these
factors combine to account for who has maintained healthy biological regulation and functional health across
time, while others have shifted toward clinically significant biological risk, or moved from pre-disease to disease
states. The MIDUS biomarker measures are also prominently featured in other projects (Survey, Daily,
Genomics) of this U19 application as well as the components (Cognitive, Affective Neuroscience, ADRD
Neuroscience) of the Ancillary U01 application."
10894199,"ABSTRACT – GENOMICS PROJECT
The MIDUS Genomics Project provides genomic data resources, analytic tools, and methodological training to
advance the overall MIDUS objective of defining the relationship between psychosocial factors and health- and
aging-related outcomes. Resources provided by this project include: 1) twin-based research strategies to
identify overall genetic influences on psychosocial and health outcomes; 2) genome-wide RNA profiles to
identify the specific gene expression pathways that mediate these influences; 3) genome-wide DNA
methylation profiles to identify the specific epigenetic pathways that mediate these influences; 4) genome-wide
single-nucleotide polymorphism profiles to identify the role of specific genetic polymorphisms and polygenic
risk profiles; 5) targeted genotyping of specific gene variants of particular relevance to MIDUS research
objectives, such as the APOE gene associated with Alzheimer’s Disease; and 6) training to MIDUS
investigators in the special substantive and analytic aspects of genomic data. Genomic measures are
collected from approximately 1200 participants in the MIDUS Biomarker Project (Core MIDUS and MIDUS
Refresher samples), and include 2 waves of RNA and DNA methylation profiles that can quantify rates of
biological aging and change over time in inflammatory biology and antiviral biology. Aims of the MIDUS
Genomics Project include: Aim 1: Collect and disseminate RNA gene expression profiles, DNA methylation
profiles, and targeted genotyping data; Aim 2: Analyze the relationship between psychosocial risk processes
(e.g., socio-economic and socio-relational disadvantage) and resilience processes (e.g., psychological well-
being and social resources), and longitudinal rates of change in the “Conserved Transcriptional Response to
Adversity” (CTRA) RNA profile and DNA methylation measures of “epigenetic age” and mortality risk; Aim 3:
Define the relationship between CTRA gene expression and epigenetic age acceleration to determine their
correlation and respective relationships to health, well-being, and disease risk. The genomic data provided by
this project provide essential genetic and molecular elements of MIDUS’s overall integrative biopsychosocial
characterization of health and well-being of mid-life Americans."
10894225,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) is the principal U.S. public institution of higher education within the
Pacific basin which offers doctorate degrees in the health professions and in the health-related sciences. UHM
has a historical record and current commitment to educating underrepresented students. We propose to further
enhance the RCMI Specialized Center, called Ola HAWAII, as the integrated “home” for research on the science
of minority health and health disparities in Hawaii. By partnering with other federally funded research and
education programs and by serving the needs of multi-ethnic and medically underserved communities in Hawaii,
we will strengthen institutional capacity building for research on the biological, socioeconomic, and
environmental determinants of health disparities. The objective of the Administrative Core (AC) is to
enhance institutional capacity to facilitate basic biomedical, clinical and behavioral research.
Specific Aim 1: Manage, coordinate and supervise Ola HAWAII activities and resource allocation.
a. Enhance organizational and governance structure for effective operations.
b. Oversee programmatic activities that enhance the career development of health disparities investigators,
 with an emphasis on research productivity.
c. Promote research through intra- and inter-institutional partnerships.
Specific Aim 2: Develop and institute a plan for the dissemination of research findings, including health
policy development through UHealthy Hawaii.
a. Foster opportunities and mechanisms for health disparities researchers to disseminate research findings.
b. Institute a plan for the translation of research findings into health policy.
Specific Aim 3: Implement a rigorous evaluation process for continuous improvement.
a. Establish and use innovative measures to evaluate research progress and productivity.
b. Collaborate with the RCMI CC to harmonize RCMI-wide common metrics.
The AC will build on a model that comprises strong visionary leadership; an accomplished team of extramurally
funded core directors and support facility leaders; experienced scientific advisors; and dedicated community
partners. The AC will capitalize on the successes of the past and present, as well as introduce innovative
approaches to develop early-stage health disparities researchers, particularly those of Native Hawaiian and
other Pacific Islander (NHOPI) and Filipino descent, and foster new collaborations and partnerships for
transdisciplinary team-science research. Expected key outcomes will include an expanded and diversified
portfolio of projects and personnel addressing minority health and health disparities, greater efficiency and use
of core facilities and services, and increased research productivity and grant success."
10894226,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes
(T2DM), with a two-fold higher prevalence than Whites in Hawaii. T2DM is characterized by hyperglycemia due
to defective insulin action in metabolic tissues, including liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. Exercise is
an effective intervention to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of developing T2DM, yet even this risk
reduction is lower in NHOPI than Whites. One important component of addressing the health disparities of
T2DM is to better understand the molecular mechanisms by which exercise increases insulin sensitivity.
Almost all cells release a class of nano-sized extracellular vesicles, called exosomes, which circulate widely
throughout the body. These exosomes carry cellular proteins, RNAs, and lipids from their cell of origin and
signal recipient cells through the release of their cargo. Recent evidence suggests that many exercise-induced
signaling molecules released from skeletal muscle (SkM) are transported in exosomes, and acute exercise
increases the number of these circulating exosomes. In pre-clinical studies, sedentary mice injected with
exosomes isolated from the SkM of exercise-trained mice show improved glucose tolerance and insulin
sensitivity. However, there are no reported studies on how exercise stimulates SkM exosome release or affects
their cargo contents, and it is poorly understood how exercise-induced SkM exosomes increase insulin
sensitivity. The objective of the proposed project is to elucidate the mechanism by which exercise-induced
SkM exosomes modulate insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism of major metabolic tissues. Our
preliminary studies have identified the exocyst protein complex as a potential link between SkM metabolism
and exosome production. We have found that exocyst activity in SkM cells is highly responsive to insulin and
contraction signaling, and in other tissues, the exocyst regulates exosome production. Our central hypothesis
is that exercise stimulates the exocyst-dependent release of exosomes in SkM, which deliver muscle-derived
factors increasing insulin sensitivity in major metabolic tissues.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: (1) Determine how exercise stimulates exosome
release in SkM cells; (2) Identify the molecular cargo and recipient tissues of exercise-induced SkM exosomes;
(3) Determine the signaling mechanism by which SkM-derived exosomes increase post-exercise insulin
sensitivity in models of insulin resistance. This project brings together state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo
approaches for the first comprehensive molecular study of SkM-derived exosomes and how they regulate
insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism of major metabolic tissues. These investigations lay the pre-clinical
foundation for therapeutic approaches with SkM exosomes, and may lead to the development of improved
exercise intervention guidelines, which will benefit NHOPI and others disproportionately afflicted by T2DM."
10894227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Native Hawaiians (NH) have the highest mortality rates of cardiometabolic diseases, such as heart disease
and diabetes, and the lowest life expectancy compared to the other major ethnic groups in Hawai‘i. NH face
environmental and economic barriers to healthy eating, which can decrease cardiometabolic risks. They are
overrepresented in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods with limited healthy food options, and are also
more likely to face food insecurity. The objective of the proposed study is to test the efficacy of MALAMA, a
culturally-grounded family-centered backyard aquaponics intervention, to increase consumption of healthy
foods, reduce food insecurity, and mitigate cardiometabolic risks in multiple NH communities.
Specific Aim 1: Test the efficacy of the MALAMA intervention in increasing consumption of healthy
foods and reducing food insecurity in three Native Hawaiian communities. We hypothesize that
participants in the intervention group will have greater improvements in healthy food consumption and food
security post-intervention compared to participants randomized to the wait-list control group and will maintain
these improvements at 12-month follow up. We will implement MALAMA in three Hawaiian Homestead
communities using a stepped-wedge wait-list randomized controlled trial design. We will recruit a total of 180
individuals from the three community sites (60 families), and families will be randomly assigned to the
intervention group or the wait-list control group at each site. We will assess changes in consumption of healthy
foods, food insecurity, and other factors related to healthy eating at baseline, post-intervention, and 1-year
follow-up. Specific Aim 2: Determine the impact of the MALAMA intervention on clinical indicators of
cardiometabolic disease risk. We hypothesize that participants in the intervention group will have greater
improvements in clinical indicators post-intervention compared with participants randomized to the wait-list
control group and will maintain these improvements at 12-month follow up. We will measure changes in
cardiometabolic disease risk by tracking participants’ blood pressure, cholesterol, HbA1C, body mass index
(BMI), and hip-waist measurements to assess changes in cardiometabolic disease risk at baseline, post-
intervention, and 1-year follow-up. Specific Aim 3: Identify facilitators and barriers to sustainability of
backyard aquaponics. We will conduct interviews with the MALAMA participants and Lima Kokua peer
leaders at one-year follow-up. We will identify facilitators and barriers to sustaining an aquaponics system. The
findings will allow us to strengthen the MALAMA intervention for broader application in other NH communities.
Successful completion of these aims will meet the Healthy People 2030 goal of increasing healthy eating
among disparate populations. It will also meet NIMHD goals of reducing health disparities in underserved and
underrepresented populations in the US. Future research will test the scalability and replication of MALAMA as
a prevention strategy in other minority, indigenous, and Pacific communities who face similar disparities."
10894228,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly one third of individuals who recover from acute COVID-19 will have chronic symptoms, so called ‘Post-
Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2’ infection (PASC). Among individuals with PASC, pulmonary complications
such as persistent dyspnea and chronic cough are common. Although Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders
(NHOPI) and Filipinos have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, the prevalence and severity of
pulmonary PASC (PPASC) among race/ethnicity is not known. As the number of individuals recovering from
COVID-19 grows, PPASC is increasing with a devastating impact on patients, families and the healthcare
system.
Monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages have been considered as key determinants of COVID-19
severity and respiratory failure. However, much less is known about their contribution to PPASC development,
resolution, and disease persistence. The objective of the proposed project is to understand the
pathophysiologic mechanisms of PPASC and how macro-social and psychological determinants are
associated with these biological mechanisms. Our preliminary data showed that monocyte counts and CD169+
monocytes were significantly higher in PPASC compared to healthy individuals. Also, CD169+ non-classical
monocytes were positively correlated with D-dimer levels in PPASC, suggesting that a specific monocyte
subset and their activation may contribute to the disease severity. Our central hypothesis is that the
development and persistence of PPASC is related to the influx of bone marrow-derived monocytes with
proinflammatory phenotype into the lungs and is associated with macro-social and psychological determinants.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following Aims: (1) To understand monocyte dysregulation associated
with the development and persistence of PPASC, particularly focusing on dynamic changes in the monocyte
number, subpopulation, activation, and cytokines during the disease progression and resolution. (2) In a subset
of the study cohort, to characterize the pathologic changes in respiratory system response to COVID-19. A
detailed characterization of cell composition and cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid will give an
insight into monocyte activation and differentiation that is responsible for inflammatory dysregulation and
fibrosis. (3) To examine the association of macro-social determinants (e.g., income and housing condition),
and psychosocial factors (e.g., social isolation) with development of PPASC and changes in monocyte
alteration. In summary, this is the first study to investigate the impact of macro-social and psychological
determinants on clinical outcome in PPASC and the relationship between monocyte alteration in individuals
with PPASC. Elucidating mechanisms in the role of monocytes in the pulmonary immunopathology of COVID-
19 will provide information for potential therapeutic interventions to ameliorate PPASC particularly among
NHOPI and Filipinos."

10894231,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Health disparities in Hawaii are significant, especially among Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders
(NHOPI) and Filipinos, and research to reduce the disparities is jeopardized by a lack of skilled, funded
investigators, especially from those groups. Achieving long-term health and wellness in communities that suffer
disproportionately from racial, ethnic, environmental and/or socioeconomic inequalities and inequities demands
a well-trained and diverse workforce. The objective of the Ola HAWAII Investigator Development Core
(IDC) is to mentor and support a diversified health disparities research workforce. In the 2022–2027
cycle, the IDC will collaborate with the Ola HAWAII Cores, the Health Policy Advisor, the Ola HAWAII
leadership team, and the program’s advisory committees to reinforce a supportive career-development milieu.
Sample innovations include: 1) customizing the Pilot Projects Program to monitor IDPs and strengthen the
mentoring environment of funded investigators; 2) personalizing the Mentoring Bootcamp with tailored
sessions for basic biomedical, clinical, and behavioral researchers; and 3) using a Research Ambassador to
increase access to mentors and reviewers outside of Hawaii and to link investigators to other RCMI sites for
training programs, multisite projects, shared resources, and new team science opportunities.
Specific Aim 1: Customize and expand the Pilot Projects Program to support post-doctoral fellows,
junior faculty, and other early-stage investigators.
a. Implement a Team-Science Pilot Projects Program.
b. Enhance career development of pilot awardees through personalized mentoring.
Specific Aim 2: Personalize and enrich the Mentoring Bootcamp Program to accelerate lead
investigator research success.
a. Implement new and focused sessions for basic biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and community
researchers.
b. Leverage and complement grant-writing and professional development activities of other research
 infrastructure programs.
The IDC is led by an exemplary team that has 70 years of experience in training and mentoring students, post-
docs, and junior faculty, predominantly from underrepresented minority groups. Activities of the IDC will spur
collaborative research on the science of health disparities, heighten research productivity, and increase
competitiveness for extramural funding. IDC activities will complement those of the other Ola HAWAII cores to
hasten the pace of scientific discovery and intervention implementation to meet the Healthy People 203017
objectives and the NIMHD goals18 of improving the health of underserved and underrepresented population."
10894233,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
At the heart of improving minority health and reducing health disparities is the effective engagement of the
most affected communities, yet community engagement is not often well planned or executed or is largely
rhetorical, resulting in little or no tangible benefits for communities. In fact, Native Hawaiians and other Pacific
Islanders (NHOPI), Filipinos, and other underserved groups in Hawaii have experienced community research
done badly, which has led to individual and community distrust of research and researchers. Done correctly,
community involvement can lead to increased external validity of studies, increased individual and community
capacity for research, decreased participant loss to follow-up, and increased availability and acceptance of
beneficial evidence-based interventions in underserved communities. The objective of the Community
Engagement Core (CEC) is to address health disparities and health-related concerns of underserved
communities by nurturing, strengthening, and sustaining trust-based collaborative relationships and
outcomes-driven engagement with community-based organizations (CBOs) and underserved communities and
groups to address their health-related concerns.
Specific Aim 1: Nurture trust-based collaborations with communities through capacity building and
resource sharing to address community-identified, health-related concerns.
 a. Expand the CEC community advisory group role.
 b. Enrich the network of community partners engaged in Ola HAWAII-supported research.
 c. Engage CBO partner, Hawaii Public Health Institute to facilitate CEC activities.
Specific Aim 2: Promote and facilitate community participation in all aspects of health disparities
research, including dissemination of research outcomes to community, academic, and policy partners.
 a. Facilitate Community-Engaged Research Studios to provide researchers with input.
 b. Expand community engagement in training university researchers on community-engaged research.
 c. Disseminate research findings through “Reports to the Community” and a quarterly e-bulletin.
The CEC will create respectful and sustainable partnerships with CBOs, equitably engage communities in
research, and support the bidirectional flow of ideas to better understand health disparities and address them
in ways that are acceptable and effective with NHOPI, Filipino, and other vulnerable communities in Hawaii.
This will accelerate research to meet the Healthy People 2030 and the NIMHD goals of understanding,
addressing, and reducing health disparities in underserved and under-represented populations, while building
community capacity for and reducing distrust in university-partnered research."

The objective of the Administrative Core is to provide scientific leadership and operational management of The
Jackson Laboratory (JAX) Cellular Senescence Collaborative (JAX-Sen) Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) in
support of SenNet goals to map cellular senescence and its associated secretory phenotype in healthy mouse
tissues. The Administrative (Admin) Core will provide the infrastructure to support all communication,

(GC) comprised of all PIs and Core Leads, an experienced Program Manager, and outside guidance from
NIH program officials as necessary. Through a thoughtful Leadership Plan, the Admin Core will provide the
overall governance of JAX-Sen that ensures robust communication within JAX-Sen and with other SenNet TMCs
(Aim 1). The Admin Core will organize and oversee regular scientific meetings to foster communication and
synergy within and across JAX-Sen, and to nurture a strong, collaborative environment across JAX-Sen’s two
project sites (The Jackson Laboratory and UConn Health), across JAX-Sen and KAPP-Sen, a SenNet-funded
human Tissue Mapping Center also based at JAX and UConn Health, and across SenNet consortium
stakeholders, namely the Technology Development Centers, other TMCs, the CODCC, the SenNet Steering
Committee, and NIH program officials. Through a Tissue Mapping Center Coordination Plan, the Admin Core
will also coordinate the development of animal cohorts, collection of mouse tissue samples, data generation,
data analysis and resource and data sharing within JAX-Sen (Aim 2). The Admin Core will provide scientific
and administrative oversight of the Biological Analysis and Data Analysis Cores. This oversight, administered

10895606,"Leptospirosis is a potentially life-threatening zoonosis with protean manifestations and a leading
cause of acute febrile illness (AFI) in the tropics. The acute phase of leptospirosis can trigger a
systemic inflammatory response, leading to multiorgan failure, including liver failure, acute
kidney injury (AKI), and pulmonary hemorrhage, significantly increasing mortality, and
potentially resulting in long-term complications. Early prediction of severe disease progression
and long-term consequences is of utmost importance. The proposed studies will involve
collaborations between the Principal Investigator and renowned researchers in the field of
leptospirosis. We have outlined two related but independent aims. Aim 1 focuses on
characterizing the host response and identifying novel biomarkers predictive of severe acute
leptospirosis using a multi-omics approach. We will analyze blood specimens and clinical data
from our existing biorepository and prospective patient recruitment, employing established and
novel machine learning analytical methods to refine proteomic, cytokine-based, and host gene
expression severity classifiers, accurately identifying patients at risk of severe disease. Our
existing biorepository contains samples collected at baseline from 218 patients with confirmed
leptospirosis, including 73 severe cases and 145 non-severe cases. Longitudinal follow-up
clinical data and blood specimens per patient are also available, enabling us to study the
temporal dynamics of the host response and disease progression. Aim 2 focuses on identifying
risk factors and novel biomarkers for leptospiral CKD and its progression. We have been
concurrently conducting a prospective multicenter cohort study and a clinical trial titled
""Leptospirosis Care Bundle Study"" across several hospitals in endemic areas. We have, and will
continue to collect long-term follow-up data on adverse outcomes, including major kidney
adverse events (MAKEs), such as all-cause mortality, dialysis, and new-onset CKD in patients
with leptospirosis at baseline. Combining data from these two ongoing projects, totaling 160
patients, will provide us with a better understanding of the mechanisms and risk factors
associated with leptospiral CKD."

 Understanding the genetic basis of complex phenotypes is a critical problem in medical and
evolutionary genetics. As the influx of rich genomic and phenotypic data accelerates via biobank-level
resources and reveals even greater fine scale genetic information, modern population genetic methods will be
critical to examine the influence of evolutionary processes on the distribution of complex traits.
 My research in this area has focused on characterizing the effects of recent population history on the
distribution of deleterious variation in individuals and on the design and application of statistical methods for
the inference of positive selection in populations. Specifically, my work demonstrates that certain population
processes create concentrations of deleterious homozygotes in genomes and that the strength of
concentration depends on recent population history. This work reveals an important mechanism by which
population history can influence the genomics of complex traits. I have also contributed to methodological
advances for the identification of genomic regions undergoing positive selection, including designing novel
haplotype summary statistics, novel likelihood statistics that account for spatial autocorrelation in genomes,
and efficient software implementing this work which has been cited hundreds of times. I have applied these
and other methods to human and non-human genomic data, uncovering the genomic basis of adaptation to
pathogen exposure in different human populations and the polygenic nature of adaptation to high altitude in
rhesus macaques.
 During the next five years, and beyond, my research will focus on identifying how evolutionary forces
shape the phenotypic landscape of modern humans and on developing uses for our knowledge of human
history to learn the genetic basis of complex traits. To this end, I will develop novel methods for the inference of
natural selection in genomes, I will develop theoretical models that connect evolutionary history to variation of
complex traits via its effect on the distribution of non-neutral genetic variation, and I will develop novel
statistical methods that leverage evolutionary information to identify genomic variation associated with traits.
This work will incorporate varying models of dominance, of genetic architecture, and of genetic overlap among
two or more traits. I will apply these models and methods to human whole-genome sequencing data sets
paired with biomedical phenotype data from diverse human populations with their own distinct histories, using
biobank resources such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program and the Hispanic Community
Health Study / Study of Latinos. My work in these areas will disentangle the relative influences of various
evolutionary processes that contribute to differences in complex traits, including disease risk, among
populations and will expand our understanding of the genetic basis of these traits in understudied populations."

Heart failure is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes and obesity, yet much remains
unknown regarding the molecular events whereby metabolic disease causes myocardial dysfunction. At the
cellular level, oxidative stress and inflammation are considered hallmarks of myocardial impairment. The
overarching hypothesis for this F31 fellowship proposal is that the stress response protein regulated in
development and DNA damage 1 (REDD1) plays a maladaptive role in the pathogenesis of heart disease by
augmenting the development of oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiomyocytes. Preliminary data support
that REDD1 expression is enhanced in the heart of mice fed a Western (i.e., high fat, high sucrose) diet and in
cardiomyocyte cultures exposed to the saturated fatty acid palmitate. Recent studies from our laboratory
demonstrate a key role for REDD1 in the development of diabetes-induced oxidative stress. More specifically,
REDD1 acts via a GSK-3β-dependent signaling axis to suppress the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2
(Nrf2) antioxidant response in the retina of diabetic mice. Additionally, REDD1 was found to promote
inflammatory signaling in macrophages by direct sequestration of inhibitor of κB (IκB), leading to nuclear factor
kappa B (NF-κB) activation. A role for REDD1 in activation of these two non-conventional signaling axes for Nrf2
repression and NF-κB activation has never been interrogated in the heart. Nor is it know if REDD1 contributes
to the development of cardiac dysfunction. To test the hypothesis, I will pursue an experimental protocol involving
model systems ranging from intact mice to cardiomyocyte cell cultures. Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism
whereby consumption of a Western diet promotes transcriptional upregulation of REDD1 in the heart. Aim 2 will
investigate the role of REDD1 in the development of oxidative stress and inflammation in cardiomyocytes. Aim
3 will determine the impact of REDD1 deletion on the development of cardiac dysfunction. In addition to my
continued graduate training in molecular biology and cellular physiology at Penn State College of Medicine, this
fellowship will provide key training opportunities with experts in cardiovascular dysfunction. Specifically, I will
learn to properly culture and manipulate adult ventricular cardiomyocytes and develop the technical expertise in
echocardiography to assess the impact of REDD1 on cardiac function in transgenic mice. With respect to
outcomes, the project will not only expand my skills and systems of analysis beyond those of my primary
Sponsor, but will also potentially identify and characterize a unifying regulatory mechanism whereby metabolic
disease limits the endogenous antioxidant response and upregulates inflammation in heart. Identification of such
a mechanism is significant because it will validate new targets for the development of preventative and/or
therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing the molecular basis of heart failure."
10897880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The burden of malaria in Malawi is among the highest in the world despite increasing coverage of standard
interventions over the last two decades. One factor that contributes to continued parasite transmission is the
diversity of malaria vectors, yet important aspects of this diversity remain poorly characterized. The Principal
Investigator, Dr. Robert McCann, is a vector biologist in the Malaria Research Program at the University of
Maryland School of Medicine. He will use a combination of field and laboratory data together with advanced
computational methods to address these gaps through three specific aims. Aim 1 will characterize vector
competence in Anopheles funestus and Anopheles arabiensis, the two dominant malaria vector species in
Malawi, using experimental membrane feeding assays with field-collected An. funestus and An. arabiensis. Aim
2 will assess the impact of species-level variation in vector competence on malaria intervention effectiveness
using an agent-based stochastic model to compare malaria intervention effectiveness under scenarios with a
range of variation in mosquito susceptibility to P. falciparum infection. Aim 3 will determine the relationship
between geographic proximity and genetic relatedness for malaria vectors in Africa using geospatially informed
bioinformatics tools to estimate migration patterns of malaria vectors. The results from these studies will improve
our understanding of the persistence of malaria parasite transmission.
 Dr. McCann’s goal is to become an independent investigator in vector ecology, while maintaining the
strong interdisciplinary collaborations necessary to make advancements in malaria intervention design,
implementation, and evaluation. Towards this goal, he proposes a comprehensive career development plan that
will enhance his existing skills in malaria vector ecology while providing mentored training in 1) experimental
infection assays, 2) agent-based infectious disease modeling, 3) spatially explicit genetic and genomic analyses,
and 4) professional development with a special focus on leading international research.
 Dr. McCann has assembled a highly accomplished and multidisciplinary team of mentors and
collaborators with unique areas of expertise including global health research, malaria transmission, vector
biology, genomics and bioinformatics, population genetics, infectious disease modeling and geospatial science.
His mentors also have a track record of successfully mentoring trainees and junior faculty and strong connections
with malaria policy stakeholders. The University of Maryland School of Medicine and The Malaria Alert Center
in Malawi will together provide the ideal environment for Dr. McCann to establish a research niche addressing
critical gaps in knowledge about malaria vector biology that will lead to improved malaria control in Malawi and
other malaria-endemic countries."
10897882,"Infertility is a common disease affecting 11% of reproductive-age women in the US. A leading cause of female
infertility is egg or embryo aneuploidy. Although aneuploidy rates are coupled to maternal age, aneuploidy
rates vary within a given maternal age group. Thus, for some patients, maternal age is an insufficient predictor.
Recent evidence suggests that maternal genetic variation confers predisposition to aneuploid conception.
However, no genetic test for a woman’s risk of aneuploid conception exists. Therefore, this project’s
objective is to identify causal maternal variants for predisposition to aneuploid conception. Using
whole-exome sequencing data from women with either high or low rates of aneuploid conception relative to
maternal age, we found that variants in genes encoding kinesins are overrepresented in patients with high
rates of aneuploid conception. Kinesins, microtubule-associated motor proteins, are promising candidate
genes for aneuploidy risk because they are key regulators of chromosome segregation and cell division. I
hypothesize that variants in genes encoding kinesins are causal variants in conferring predisposition to
aneuploid conception. I will address this hypothesis in Aim 1 by assessing these candidate genetic variants for
their ability to cause aneuploidy in mouse eggs and, for those that screen positive, determine the egg
development event that is disrupted. I will then evaluate the variants via in silico tools. In Aim 2, I will build
upon my preliminary data, which reveal that variants in one candidate gene, KIF18A, cause catastrophic
spindle defects in mouse eggs, and I will dissect how the kinesin motor domain of KIF18A contributes to
aneuploidy via mouse models and in silico protein structure analysis. These data will facilitate establishment of
causal maternal genetic variants in aneuploidy and provide insight into the specific mechanisms of KIF18A
motor domain variation in aneuploidy. These studies are the research training arm of a comprehensive training
plan that will build a strong foundation for a career as a physician-scientist in women’s reproductive health. Via
the proposed research, I will gain experience in rigorous and creative research approaches to egg biology, the
molecular basis of female infertility, genetic disease research in mouse models, and computational genomics.
This work will be conducted at the Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, with state-of-the-art microscopy
facilities, modern mouse oocyte research facilities, powerful computational genetics resources, and rich faculty
expertise. My research experience will be enhanced by targeted advanced training courses in reproduction,
high-resolution microscopy, and genomics. The entirety of my training will be coupled to a longitudinal clinical
training program including reproductive endocrinology and infertility, perinatal genetics, and maternal-fetal
medicine at the state’s largest academic healthcare center, Rutgers University. The mentored research and
comprehensive training plan proposed has been carefully designed to build increasing independence for a
productive translational reproductive health career."
10897883,"Secreted antibodies play an important role in the neutralization of pathogens and the protection of host.
Two types of ASCs develop during B cell responses: short lived plasmablasts (PBs) and long-lived plasma
cells (PCs). In secondary lymphoid organs, antigen-activated B cells differentiate into PBs. Some of these
PBs home to bone marrow, where they differentiate into long-lived PCs. In bone marrow, PCs persist from
a few months to years and secrete copious amounts of high-affinity antibodies which are central to the
neutralization of pathogens. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the
development, survival and function of plasma cells is critical to designing better vaccines to generate
effective immune responses. Ufm1 (ubiquitin-fold modifier 1) is a ubiquitin-like polypeptide that is post-
translationally conjugated to target proteins via the ufmylation process and thereby modifies their function.
Ufm1 binding protein (Ufbp1 or DDGRK1) is the first identified target of the ufmylation pathway. Ufl1 is
the E3 ligase that attaches Ufm1 to Ufbp1. We published a novel role of Ufbp1 in development and function
of ASCs. Consistent with this, mice lacking Ufbp1 in B cells have significantly reduced amounts of serum
immunoglobulins and mount a highly defective antibody response against antigens. Aim 1 will use
structure-function analysis to identify the regions of Ufbp1 that differentially regulate development of ASC
and helps them to acquire the ability to produce antibodies. Aim 2 will test the roles of Ufm1 and Ufl1
pathway in development and function of ASCs. Aim3 will test the role of Ufbp1, Ufl1 and Ufm1 in promoting
survival of long-lived PCs, maintaining their functionality and underlying molecular mechanisms. The
outcome of the proposed study will provide an understanding of a novel molecular mechanism underlying
Ufbp1-mediated promotion of antibody response and could potentially help in designing better vaccines
and treatments for pathologies related to antibody secreting cells."

Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) is characterized by difficulties in the ability to learn and use language
and is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders (prevalence 7-12%1,2). Though problems emerge
in childhood, DLD continues into adulthood3-6 and has profoundly negative effects. Adults with DLD are less likely
to seek post-secondary education7-9, may have extended bouts of unemployment9, and have higher rates of
depression10. Yet, DLD in adulthood is severely under-researched. An understanding of the language profile is
crucial as language abilities in adulthood impact well-being, income, and job performance11. Additionally, there
is a clear need to better understand the mechanisms that mediate language abilities in adults with and without
DLD. Doing so will help explain theories of DLD12-15 (speed of processing and working memory accounts) and
expose a wider range of individual differences in language ability. Examining competition – the activation of
competing linguistic representations as speech unfolds – is an ideal approach to exploring these mechanisms.
Competition is a fundamental component of language, is well-documented in typical adults16-19, and critically,
distinct aspects of competition can be linked to each theoretical account20,21. Our overall objective is to
characterize the long-term outcomes of DLD in adulthood (Aim 1) and to identify specific cognitive mechanisms
mediating these outcomes (Aim 2). To address our objectives, we utilize a large, pre-existing dataset and
participant pool from one of the most comprehensive examinations of DLD to date: the Iowa Longitudinal Study22.
We will re-recruit subjects with DLD (n=150) and with typical language (TL; n=250) from this historic cohort, who
are now adults (30–34 years old). In Aim 1, we leverage retrospective language measures from kindergarten
through 10th grade and collect new outcome measures in adulthood to characterize the long-term outcomes of
DLD. We predict that adults with DLD will diverge from adults with TL in language skills that are more complex
and higher-level language skills that are important for communication in the workplace11. Further, we predict a
fanning effect: some children with DLD will “catch up” to their TL peers in adulthood, some will show evidence of
a decline, and others will show stable trajectories. In Aim 2, we measure real-time competition across language
modality and level using eye-tracking in the Visual World Paradigm23. According to speed of processing
accounts15,20, adults with DLD may be slower than their TL peers to activate competitors and targets. According
to working memory accounts21,24, adults with DLD will show sustained competitor activation.
Further,
we predict
that measures related to the dynamics of competition (speed of activation and timing of competitor suppression)
will account for variation in language outcomes in adults across the ability spectrum. The proposed work would
represent the largest and most comprehensive characterization of language abilities in adults with (and without)
DLD to date, inform theories of DLD and general theories of language processing, and provide foundational
knowledge toward clinical models of prevention and long-term intervention for adults with DLD."

Primary blast overpressure, such as that produced by explosive devices, has become an increasing cause of
injury in both military and civilian populations. Dizziness and imbalance are frequent complaints of blast victims.
However, few studies addressed the impact of blast overpressure on the vestibular system, representing an
important knowledge gap in developing effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment programs of vestibular
deficits in blast victims. To fill the knowledge gap, the goal of the application is to elucidate the mechanisms of
blast-induced vestibular injuryin a rat model. The application is built upon our newly developed blast injury device
that delivers blast waves directly into the external ear canal of rats. This model allows us investigate impact of
primary blast on the vestibular system while avoiding damage to other air-filled organs. The blast-induced
vestibular injury model was validated by our preliminary studies that assess vestibular hair cell histology, single
vestibular afferent activity and vestibulo-ocular reflex(VOR). Results fromthe preliminary studies suggested that
blast-induced vestibular injury is complex in nature and involves a combination of acute and progressive injury
at all levels spanning from the periphery to the central vestibular system. The preliminary results lead to our
hypothesis that blast exposure triggers degenerative processes in the Type I hair cell mediated pathways and
the vestibular function reflects interactions of injury progression and compensatory processes. Current
application will take advantage of the novel blast injury model to identify acute-to-chronic morphological,
physiological and behavioral biomarkers of the vestibular deficits caused by exposure to blast overpressure
waves with different intensities. Aim 1 is to investigate blast-induced structural damage to the vestibular system.
We will investigate whether different end organs, types of vestibular hair cells or types of nerve endings exhibit
different levels of susceptibility to blast exposure and different recovery over a period of 6 hours to 12 months.
We will also investigate injury progression in the vestibular nuclei by analyzing biomarkers of inflammation,
axonal damage and apoptosis. In addition, a 3D biomechanical model will be constructed to simulate blast
energy propagation through the inner ear to quantify mechanical effects. Aim 2 is to employ single unit recording
to assess injury progression in vestibular afferents following blast exposure. Spontaneous discharge and
dynamic responses of different subgroups of afferents from the canals and otoliths will be studied. Aim 3 is to
assess blast-induced vestibular injury progression by measuring the rotational and translational VORs. Both
steady state and transient VORs will be measured to assess integrative outcomes of vestibularinjury progression
and compensatory processes and identify the optimal VOR paradigms for diagnosis of blast-induced vestibular
injury. Results from the study will elucidate the mechanisms underlying blast-induced vestibular deficits and
provide essential information for early diagnosis and targets for intervention."

This proposal is for a competitive renewal of a post-doctoral training program in Molecular & Genetic
Epidemiology of Cancer (MGEC). The current era of cancer research employs extraordinary tools for
understanding the genetic and environmental causes of carcinogenesis. Using these tools to their
fullest extent requires input from teams of scientists with a variety of backgrounds, including molecular
biology, oncology, medicine, genetics, epidemiology, and biostatistics. Individuals with multi-disciplinary
education across these fields are crucial to the success of such teams, as they can coordinate the
integrated work necessary to accomplish some of the most promising research. However, the focused
nature of most training opportunities provides limited opportunities for investigators to obtain knowledge
that bridges these disciplines. To address this issue, we propose renewing the current MGEC training
program from the current R25T mechanism to a T32 mechanism.
This program offers to exceptional postdoctoral candidates a set of instructional and research
opportunities that prepare them for careers as independent researchers in the interdisciplinary “field” of
molecular and genetic epidemiology. Mentors and research training opportunities will come from the
University of California, San Francisco and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of
Research. This program is well-suited to the T32 grant mechanism because it trains scientists at the
intersection of multiple distinct fields. More specifically, the MGEC program blends together in a highly
interactive fashion a group of mentors and trainees with cancer research expertise in molecular biology,
genetics, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The program is defined by three main components: (1) a
specialized core curriculum covering key disciplines and their intersections; (2) additional educational
experiences to complement the research and educational backgrounds and interest of trainees; and (3)
focused research projects supervised by committed mentors. Each trainee will also be required to write
an NIH proposal as part of their career preparation. Previous trainees have shown great success in
developing independent research careers. Individuals trained in the MGEC program will have the skills
vital to furthering their careers in research to decipher the causes of cancer, ultimately providing
valuable knowledge regarding the prevention and treatment of this complex disease."
10898667,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding the biological basis of aging-related diseases is becoming paramount as the global population
ages and the burden of chronic disease weighs on healthcare systems. Cellular senescence has emerged as a
unifying feature of multiple age-associated pathologies, having been identified as a significant player in
numerous cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, hepatic fibrosis and steatosis, and age associated muscle
dysfunction. Senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest that also features mitochondrial dysfunction, lipid
accumulation, and a highly inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This SASP is
currently thought to be one of the primary causes of senescence-associated tissue dysfunction. The SASP,
consisting of cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, proteases, and lipid-derived eicosanoids, promotes chronic
inflammation and dysfunction in neighboring cells. To date, research in this area has mainly focused on
detrimental effects of secreted SASP proteins, leaving the lipid/eicosanoid contribution to SASP and
senescence largely unstudied.
Senescent cells characteristically accumulate lipid droplets (LDs), which have recently been identified as central
nodes in the inflammatory response and as sites for eicosanoid production. LD metabolism can either contribute
to or protect against inflammation depending on the composition of proteins residing on the LD surface. One
such protein, Perilipin 2 (PLIN2), has been shown to play pivotal roles in multiple inflammatory conditions and
can regulate the efflux of inflammatory lipids from the LD. My primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms
by which LDs and LD proteins modulate senescence, which could allow for specific targeting of this inflammatory
process. My central hypothesis is that PLIN2 plays a key role in the initiation and maintenance of SASP
and senescence. We will test this hypothesis by establishing a mechanism by which PLIN2 interacts with
eicosanoid synthesizing enzymes in senescence and regulates eicosanoid release from the LD. Then we will
show that PLIN2 knockout in senescent cells in aged mice attenuates global inflammation, reduces the SASP in
senescent cells, and enhances healthspan of aged mice. No study to date has investigated a role for PLIN2 in
senescence. This proposal will lay the groundwork establishing PLIN2 and the LD as central to senescence and
SASP, thus unveiling a novel mechanism by which senescence contributes to aging."

Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) has been recommended by WHO for malaria endemic countries in
sub-Saharan Africa with strong seasonal malaria transmission since 2012. The intervention consists of the
administration of full treatment doses of Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP) plus Amodiaquine to children less than
5 years of age every 4 weeks during the malaria transmission season for 3 to 4 rounds per year. Since 2016,
Mali has implemented the strategy countrywide. While significant decreases in malaria cases among the target
age group was observed, increasing trends in malaria among children 5 years and above is also reported in the
many settings where SMC is being implemented. The proposed study considers previous studies and pilot data
showing that approximately out of every eight children (12.5%) have historically received either no doses or a
single dose out of a the required four doses for the treatment regimen. This study seeks to enroll a large cohort
of children to permit a large-scale comparison between children previously compliant to SMC with a valid control
group (children not previously compliant to SMC) to elucidate the effects of phasing out of the SMC program due
to age ineligibility. The primary objective of this R01 proposal is to investigate the withdrawal effects of SMC
due to age eligibility requirements through the following three specific aims: 1) Determine malaria rebound
occurrence following SMC enrollment including its association with severe malaria and anemia; 2) Assess
changes in the age-specific P. falciparum prevalence, sexual and asexual parasites, and multiplicity of infection
following SMC deployment; and 3) Assess the change in immune response to malaria antigens during and
following SMC eligibility and the relationship with disease. The study will provide valuable information on the
impact of SMC stoppage at five years of age which can significant contribute improving monitoring malaria
outcomes in other low- and middle-income countries overall."

 The International Research Scientist Development Award affords an ideal mentorship opportunity to
support the transition to independence of the candidate, an internist, pediatrician and pediatric infectious
diseases physician with expertise caring for children and adults with HIV and tuberculosis (TB). The candidate’s
long-term goal is to become an independent investigator, generating much needed evidence to inform child HIV
and TB policy and practice. The candidate is based full-time in Eswatini and will work across the Baylor

10898771,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 As age-specific incidence rates of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) decline in the US,
due, in part, to improvements in cardiovascular health, it is imperative that we study how favorable
cardiovascular health promotes successful brain aging. Favorable cardiovascular health quantified using The
American Heart Association’s Life’s Simple 7 (LS7) is cited as an ideal metric to study successful brain aging
given its role in preserving and promoting late-life cognitive and motor functioning. The limited data that exists
on LS7 and brain health focuses on isolated grey matter atrophy or white matter abnormalities, i.e., white
matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and infarcts; no study, to date, has employed a multi-modal assessment of
brain health as related to cardiovascular health, or taken advantage of advances in the field of connectomics to
study brain network integrity via comprehensive maps of neural connections based on neuroimaging data.
Considering the contribution of multiple brain structural alterations is critical given that brain changes suffered
at one level, e.g., grey matter atrophy or white matter damage in the form of WMHs and infarcts, negatively
impact brain structure at another level, e.g., connectivity between brain regions.
Applying previously published
methods,
we will create multi-modal structural connectome integrity matrices of subtle brain alterations and
frank damage to address gaps in the literature and determine how LS7 preserves brain health and promotes
cognitive and motor functioning in older non-Latino White, Black, and Latino adults.
 To achieve the overall goal of this study – to determine cardiovascular-connectome relationships that
promote brain health in older adults – we will combine biennial neuroimaging data, annual cardiovascular
lifestyle and biological LS7 data, and annual cognitive and motor testing on 535 participants of the Rush
Memory and Aging Project with up to
12
years of data collection; a subset of whom also have ADRD
neuropathological data. Ante-mortem, cross-sectional data will be available from 450 non-Latino Black and 150
Latino participants from two other harmonized Rush cohort studies. Together, this will ensure our success
investigating change in connectome integrity and the role of LS7 (Aim 1), the relationship of connectome
integrity with cognitive and motor decline, and how it varies by LS7 (Aim 2), whether LS7 modifies associations
between neuropathology and connectome integrity (Aim 3), and cross-sectional associates of LS7 and
connectome integrity within non-Latino Black and Latino adults, separately (Aim 4). This study’s cross-cutting
themes of cardiovascular health, state-of-the-art neuroimaging analytics, comprehensive behavioral
assessment, and gold-standard neuropathology will provide a wealth of information never before documented
and exert a sustained influence on the field. Specifically, this R01 will identify neuropathological underpinnings
of late-life brain network integrity and the role of favorable cardiovascular health and may provide refined MRI
targets and specific behavioral outcomes for use in lifestyle interventions with less healthy older adults."
10898772,"Project Summary: Memory Formation in Motor Cortex
Memories both impart identity and provide competence in our daily activities. Our motor memories are
crucial for interacting with the world around us: The loss of dexterity can be a particularly debilitating
consequence of stroke. Despite their importance, we still know very little about how the brain forms and
stores the memories of our motor abilities. This research project endeavors to understand the role of the
primary motor cortex (M1) in the inception and retention of motor memories. Since it is the organized
activity of populations of neurons that control our movements, we seek signatures of memories in how
neural populations change their activity after a learning experience. We adopt a powerful tool for
studying learning in the motor cortex – brain computer interfaces (BCIs). In a BCI, the user generates
patterns of neural activity which drive the movement of an external device, such as a cursor on a
computer screen. Decades of prior research have demonstrated the validity of BCIs as a tool to study
learning in the motor system, and here we leverage that prior research to study motor memories. Our
three Specific Aims address different aspects of motor memories: First, we examine the link between
signatures of a memory in M1 population activity and improved behavioral performance following
learning. Second, we examine how learning something new is influenced by the memory of a previous
learning experience, and conversely, how new learning can impact the neural encoding of an existing
motor memory. Third, we examine the consolidation of motor memories, to see what changes in the
days after a learning experience. Our BCI paradigm offers powerful advantages for exploring these
questions. This is because a BCI directly couples neural population activity to a behavior. This direct
causal relationship makes it possible to see the appearance of a motor memory that is specific to and
appropriate for the behavior that has been learned, and to track it over time. Also, because we use BCI
systems in our basic-science studies, our findings have direct clinical relevance for the ongoing effort to
improve BCIs so that they can restore dexterous and flexible motor control to individuals with paralysis."

or Parkinson’s disease. Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) represents the most severe subtype of stroke. An
estimated 40-50% of ICH victims will die and more than 80% of survivors remain disabled. Patients with ICH
share histopathological features with other forms of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) caused by
hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CSVD is a key component of progressive neurologic decline in
Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia, and nearly half of ICH survivors develop dementia within 4 years.
 Our investigators have previously collaborated to publish the largest genome wide association study of ICH
with ~1500 cases, which identified novel genetic factors that have since gone on to be replicated in CSVD
phenotypes including white matter hyperintensity and small vessel stroke. With greater sample size, we will
uncover additional risk factors for ICH and through those mechanisms, Alzheimer’s and vascular dementias.
 The Ethnic/Racial Variations of Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ERICH) study originally recruited over 3000 cases
of spontaneous hemorrhage with equal power among white, black and Hispanic cases. The study design begins
with the philosophy that both ethnicity-specific and non-specific risk factors for ICH may exist, and numerous
ERICH publications support this. We propose to combine additional ICH cases from around the world to
maximize the power of our study to identify novel genetic variants across ethnicities. We have identified over
21,000 cases that have either completed genotyping or have samples available to assess genetic risk of ICH.
 However, the critical first step is to perform careful phenotype harmonization, specifically in location of
hemorrhage which stratifies patients clinically, histopathologically, and genetically. Different studies have used
different location definitions which if not harmonized will limit study power due to case misclassification. We have
previously performed phenotype harmonization across our two centers for both ICH case status and location in
>5,000 cases across 3 NIH-funded studies. We intend to complete harmonization on cases with available data,
and expand harmonization to related imaging CSVD phenotypes and clinical outcomes. Next, we will combine
genomic data to create polygenic risk scores (PRS) to stratify cumulative genetic risk of ICH at the individual
level, which may provide a near-term opportunity to leverage genomic association data to improve clinical care.
Finally, we will maximally share all association results and phentoypes through the Cerebrovascular Disease
Knowledge Portal, a freely-accessible on-line collaborative resource established with NINDS support.
 If successful, we will have identified risk factors for ICH, subtypes by location and across CSVD neuroimaging
features, which will be valuable as targets for rational therapeutic development. We will also have built PRS for
ICH risk and outcome, as a tool to stratify individuals by ICH risk and provide prognostic information on outcomes."
10904620,"This Merit proposal is part of a BLR&D Collaborative Merit Award for TBI (CTBI) proposal (RFP #BX-19-006)
involving three separate but integrated proposals that together investigate the mechanisms by which TBI
enhances impulsivity and suicidal behavior in Veterans. The rationale for the collaborative project is to combine
neurobiological mechanistic studies in animals with human imaging and biomarker analysis to understand the
manner in which TBI influences impulsivity and suicidal behavior. The overarching hypothesis is that TBI
enhances impulsivity, a risk factor for suicide particularly in response to stress, through inflammation and
dysfunction of the serotonin system and frontal lobe circuitry.
The number of new traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases for U.S. Military forces has more than doubled in the last
five years and will continue to grow. TBI is a risk factor for suicidality. Moreover, increased impulsivity is one
of the most prevalent symptoms following TBI, and is itself a risk factor for suicide, depression and drug abuse.
Thus, understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for high impulsivity following TBI is key to
understanding the link between TBI and suicide. Serotonin is important for rational decision-making and loss
of serotonin neurons leads to increased impulsivity. Previously, we demonstrated that mild TBI (mTBI) in an
animal model caused long-lasting suppression of the acoustic startle response (ASR), pathological
inflammation and degeneration of neurons in the nucleus reticularis pontis caudalis (PnC), a brain region
essential for ASR. Anatomically, serotonergic neurons in the pontine raphe nucleus are located in the
immediate vicinity of the PnC, and it is not unreasonable to expect inflammation and neurodegeneration in the
raphe nucleus following mTBI, as in the PnC. Our preliminary data support this idea. We also present
preliminary results that mTBI increases motor and cognitive impulsivity following lateral fluid percussion injury
in rats. The proposed studies will build on these preliminary results and investigate the hypothesis that
inflammation and degeneration of the serotonergic raphe nuclei lead to increased impulsivity after TBI. This
hypothesis will be tested in three aims. Aim 1 will determine whether mild TBI (mTBI) alone and in
combination with social isolation stress enhances impulsivity. The lateral fluid percussion injury model will be
used to generate mTBI in rats. Two aspects of impulsivity will be assessed: motor impulsivity and cognitive
impulsivity using a Go/No-Go and a delay discounting procedure, respectively. It is predicted that impulsivity
will be increased at 1 month and continue to worsen at 3 months after TBI. Aim 2 will determine whether mTBI
causes inflammation and degeneration of serotonergic raphe neurons. The prediction is that mTBI will cause
an early inflammatory response in the raphe nuclei, followed by loss of serotonergic neurons starting at 1
month after mTBI with greater degeneration at 3 months. Aim 3 will determine if blocking inflammation
immediately or 1 week after mTBI or enhancing serotonin levels at the time of behavioral testing will
prevent/reverse the TBI-induced impulsivity. It is predicted that blocking inflammation with an inhibitor of NFB
will prevent inflammation from occurring after mTBI and thereby prevent degeneration of serotonergic neurons,
and impulsivity. Additionally, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are expected to enhance synaptic
serotonin and thereby reverse the enhanced impulsivity due to TBI.
The proposed studies will test the novel hypothesis that loss of brainstem serotonin neurons is a key
mechanism by which mTBI increases impulsiveness, a risk factor for suicide. While animal models are not
able to directly assess suicide risk, this specific proposal will provide a mechanistic explanation of TBI-induced
impulsivity, while human studies in this Collaborative Merit application will provide the final link between
impulsivity and suicidality."
10904820,"Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) pathology is linked to synucleinopathies including Parkinson's disease and Lewy body
dementia, but the underlying disease mechanisms remain poorly understood. The prevalent viewpoint has
emerged that aggregation of aSyn triggers neuropathology through a gain-of-toxic-function mechanism, and
approaches to eliminate aSyn represent an active area of research for treatment. Yet, aSyn aggregation may
also endanger neurons by removing aSyn from synaptic vesicles (its physiologically relevant intracellular
location) and thereby causing loss-of-function. Through its synaptic vesicle-bound state, aSyn regulates
synaptic vesicle trafficking, and chaperones SNARE-complex assembly to maintain neurotransmitter release.
Thus, removing aSyn from neurons may not be protective, but detrimental. The objective in this application is
to determine the impact of synaptic vesicle-binding of aSyn on aSyn function and neuron survival, using
rationally designed variants of aSyn that stabilize synaptic vesicle-binding. The central hypothesis is that
stabilizing binding of aSyn on synaptic vesicles reduces aSyn toxicity and pathology. Guided by strong
preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Determine the effect of increased
synaptic vesicle-binding of aSyn on SNARE-complex assembly; 2) Assess the effect of increased synaptic
vesicle-binding of aSyn on synaptic vesicle cycling; and 3) Test if increased synaptic vesicle-binding of αSyn
rescues neurotoxicity and pathology in vivo. Under the first aim, SNARE-complex assembly will be quantified in
vivo and in vitro, using cell biological and biochemical techniques. Under the second aim, αSyn
multimerization, synaptic vesicle pools and clustering, and synaptic vesicle cycling will be quantified, using cell
biological, biochemical and biophysical techniques. Under the third aim, mouse models will be generated by
stereotactic injections of lentiviral vectors into the substantia nigra of aSyn knockout mice to assess effects of
mutant aSyn variants on αSyn-induced toxicity and pathology, using behavioral assays on mice and
biochemical, histological and ultrastructural analyses on injected brains. The study is expected to show
improved aSyn function and delayed pathology upon stabilization of synaptic vesicle-binding of αSyn. This
research is innovative because it 1) tests the novel hypothesis that stabilizing synaptic vesicle-bound αSyn
reduces aSyn pathology, 2) creates new tools to study function and dysfunction of αSyn, and 3) uses a
multidisciplinary approach to test our hypothesis from single molecules and cellular systems to live mice. This
work is significant, because it will 1) clarify the importance of synaptic vesicle-binding of aSyn for neuron
function, 2) provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of synaptic vesicle-binding of αSyn, 3) uncover
the contribution of loss-of-function of aSyn to disease pathogenesis, and 4) have translational importance for
the development of new treatment strategies aimed at stabilizing synaptic vesicle-bound αSyn."
10904825,"Mutant KRAS drives human cancers from several sites, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)
and low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC). Despite the prevalence of RAS mutations in different cancers,
effective RAS-targeted treatment remains a challenge. KRAS monomers form homodimers and nanoclusters in
the cell membrane to optimize signaling and to transform cells efficiently. Dimerization of KRAS is required for
RAS-driven transformation and cancer growth. Agents that disrupt mutant RAS dimers and clusters can block
oncogenic activity. Recent evidence indicates that inhibition of RAS signaling induces autophagy and enhances
the response to anti-autophagic therapy. Despite four decades of effort, development of effective strategies for
the treatment for mutant KRAS-driven cancers remains a work in progress. Our laboratory has discovered a
novel endogenous physiological RAS inhibitor designated DIRAS3, a 26 KDa GTPase sharing 50-60% homology
with classical RAS family members, but with a distinctive 34 amino acid N-terminal extension that reverses RAS
function. Like RAS, DIRAS3 is prenylated at the C-terminal CAAX site, binds GTP with high affinity, exhibits
weak GTPase activity, and requires membrane association for its biological function. DIRAS3 is downregulated
in a number of cancers including PDAC and LGSOC, and re-expression of DIRAS3 blocks cancer cell
proliferation, inhibits motility, and, importantly, induces autophagy by multiple mechanisms. Recently we have
found that DIRAS3 and a DIRAS3-derived stapled peptide from its α5 domain interact directly with mutant KRAS,
reducing KRAS dimerization and nanoclustering, and inhibiting KRAS signaling. Both intact DIRAS3 and
DIRAS3-derived stapled peptide induce autophagy and potentiate the pro-apoptotic activity of autophagy
inhibitors in PDAC and LGSOC cells. In this proposal, we will study the effect of DIRAS3 on KRAS-dependent
cell growth, migration and effector signaling in MEF cells and genetically engineered mouse model with mutant
KRAS, as well as in KRAS-driven PDAC and LGSOC, better defining the mechanism by which DIRAS3 inhibits
KRAS (Aim 1). We will investigate the mechanisms by which DIRAS3 induces autophagy in KRAS-driven PDAC
and LGSOC (Aim 2). Finally, we will test the ability of DIRAS3 or a DIRAS3-derived stapled peptide in
combination with autophagy inhibitors (CQ/DC661) to enhance apoptosis and growth inhibition in PDAC and
LGSOC (Aim3). These studies will not only lay the groundwork for exploring new therapeutic strategies targeting
KRAS-mutant cancers, but also contribute to a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which DIRAS3,
as a tumor suppressor, inhibits mutant KRAS activity and induces autophagy."
10905000,"Project Summary
The rapid formation of new memories and the recall of old memories to inform decisions is essential for human
cognition, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. The long-term goal of this research
is a circuit-level understanding of human memory to enable the development of new treatments for the
devastating effects of memory disorders. Our experiments utilize the rare opportunity to record in-vivo from
human single neurons simultaneously in multiple brain areas in patients undergoing treatment for drug resistant
epilepsy. The overall objective is to continue and expand a multi-institutional (Cedars-Sinai/Caltech, Johns
Hopkins, U Toronto, Children's/Harvard, UC Denver, UCSB), integrated, and multi-disciplinary team. Jointly, we
have the expertise and patient volume to test key predictions on the neural substrate of human memory. We will
utilize a combination of (i) in-vivo recordings in awake behaving humans assessing memory strength through
confidence ratings, (ii) focal electrical stimulation to test causality, and (iii) computational analysis and modeling.
We will apply these techniques to investigate three overarching hypotheses on the mechanisms of episodic
memory. First, we will determine the role of persistent neuronal activity in translating working memories into long-
term declarative memories (Aim 1). Second, we will determine how declarative memories are translated into
decisions (Aim 2). Third, we will investigate how event segmentation, temporal binding and reinstatement during
temporally extended experience facilitate episodic memory. The expected outcomes of this work are an
unprecedented characterization of how episodic memories are formed, retrieved and used for decisions, and
how temporally extended experiences are segmented to form distinct but linked episodes. This work is significant
because we move beyond a “parts list” of neurons and brain areas by testing circuit-based hypotheses by
simultaneously recording single-neurons from multiple frontal cortical and subcortical temporal lobe areas in
humans who are forming, declaring and describing their memories. The proposed work is unusually innovative
because we combine single-neuron recordings in multiple areas in behaving humans, develop new methods for
non-invasive localization of implanted electrodes and electrical stimulation and directly test long-standing
theoretical predictions on the role of evidence accumulation in memory retrieval. A second significant innovation
is our team, which combines the patient volume and expertise of several major centers to maximally utilize the
rare neurosurgical opportunities available to directly study the human nervous system. This innovative approach
permits us to investigate circuit-level mechanisms of human memory that cannot be studied non-invasively in
humans nor in animal models. This integrated multi-disciplinary combination of human in-vivo single-neuron
physiology, behavior, and modeling will contribute significantly to our understanding of the circuits and patterns
of neural activity that give rise to human memory, which is a central goal of human neuroscience in general and
the BRAIN initiative in particular."

The scientific goals of the CGE Program are achieved through three interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Genome
Plasticity: To evaluate how normal and pathological pathways of DNA repair contribute to the genomic instability
associated with cancer; (2) Epigenetics: To determine how changes in chromatin modification and organization
promote tumor development; and 3. Computational Genomics and Genetics: To develop and implement
multiscale, genome-wide strategies to identify the genomic aberrations that drive cancer development. In
particular, CGE Members continue to provide pivotal insights into how DNA repair, a critical tumor suppression
mechanism, is essential for maintenance of genome stability. Furthermore, following major strategic investments
in cancer genomics and epigenomics, CGE Members work at the forefront of research in several tumor types,
including ALL, PTCL, DLBCL and glioblastoma, with strong computational biology collaborations.
The CGE Program addresses research relevant to the HICCC Catchment Area by focusing on triple-negative
breast cancer and peripheral T cell lymphoma. In turn, the HICCC facilitates CGE research and development by
supporting internal pilot studies, multi-investigator grants proposals, strategic faculty recruitments, and use of
Shared Resources. Consequently, the CGE Program maintains a strong portfolio of intra- and inter-
programmatic multi-investigator grants, which includes existing NCI-funded programs that anchor both Aim 1
(P01-CA174653; DNA double-strand break repair, chromosomes translocations and cancer) and Aim 3 (U54-
CA193313, Topology of cancer evolution and heterogeneity), as well as a developing epigenetics program
project aligned with Aim 2. The CGE Members contribute to the daily operation of multiple HICCC Shared
Resources and participate actively in cancer training at all levels. Finally, the computational/mathematical
genomics research of CGE Members continues to have a growing impact across all HICCC activities,
encompassing the full spectrum of basic, translational, clinical and population research.
In 2018, 41 program members had a total of $16M in cancer-focused, peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of
which $9.2M (57%) was from NCI, $4.8M (30%) from other NIH sources, and $1.9M (12%) from other peer-
review agencies. During the current project period, CGE Members authored a total of 959 cancer-relevant
publications, of which 112 (12%) were intra-programmatic and 202 (21%) inter-programmatic. Notably, 29% of
these CGE publications appeared in journals with impact factors >10."
10880403,"TUMOR BIOLOGY AND MICROENVIRONMENT PROGRAM: SUMMARY
The Tumor Biology and Microenvironment (TBM) Program investigates cell-autonomous processes that
underlie signaling pathways and cancer stemness as well as tumor cell-extrinsic mechanisms by which stromal
niche factors and immune components modulate malignancy. Members pursue studies of novel
immunotherapies and other stromal targeted therapeutics (e.g. neuronal cells), and incorporate new findings and
innovative approaches such as 3D organoid cultures for translation to pre-clinical applications and development
of early-stage clinical trials. The TBM program is led by Michael Shen, PhD, Timothy Wang, MD, and Charles
Drake, MD, PhD who have complementary scientific expertise. They direct a program with 49 members who
have been collectively responsible for $16.4M of cancer-focused peer-reviewed funding in 2019, as well as 800
publications, of which 251 publications in journals with an impact factor >10 in the current funding period. During
the project period, there were 486 accruals to clinical trials, of which 235 were investigator-initiated, and 139
corresponded to underrepresented minority patients.
The TBM Program pursues three interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Investigation of tissue stem/progenitor cells and
cancer cell stemness to identify molecular mechanisms that drive tumor malignancy and plasticity, and to identify
strategies to target these processes; (2) Analysis of the tumor microenvironment to understand how stromal-
epithelial cell interactions and components of the stem cell niche can modulate tumor growth; and (3)
Investigation of tumor immunology and immunotherapy to elucidate the interaction of immune cells with cancer
stem cells and the mechanisms that underlie the resistance of tumors to immunotherapy. In particular, the TBM
Program addresses research relevant for the catchment area by focusing on prostate cancer in African-American
men, as well as studies of triple-negative breast and pancreatic cancers. The TBM Program fosters the growth
of Members through meetings and retreats, development funds, support of multi-investigator grant proposals,
support through Shared Resources, strategic faculty recruitments, and interactions with the other HICCC
Programs. The TBM Program also provides leadership in cancer research career enhancement through
mentorship of early-stage researchers through training grants, fellowships and career development awards.
Future goals of the TBM program include support for strategic recruitments of senior and junior faculty (areas of
therapies that target the interactions of cancer stem cells and the tumor microenvironment), increased clinical
trials in the area of immunotherapy including overcoming nodes of resistance, and development of inter-
programmatic platforms for precision oncology."
10880404,"PRECISION ONCOLOGY AND SYSTEMS BIOLOGY PROGRAM: SUMMARY
Cancer is an increasingly complex and dynamic disease, requiring equally complex and multidisciplinary
solutions implemented by transdisciplinary investigator teams. The Precision Oncology and Systems Biology
(POSB) Program seeks to address this challenge by developing innovative, quantitative, multi-omics models and
by leveraging molecular- and image-based biomarkers for their translation to the clinic. Under the co-leadership
of Andrea Califano, Dr. Chair of Systems Biology and Richard Carvajal MD, Director of Phase 1 Experimental
Therapeutics and Director of Melanoma Service, the POSB Program comprises 40 Members from four basic
sciences and seven clinical departments, as well as biomedical engineering, across three schools at Columbia
University. During the project period, the Aims of the POSB Program - previously called the Cancer Regulatory
Network (CRN) Program - were further focused towards leveraging innovative, model-based methodologies and
technologies to implement a precision oncology framework vital to effective clinical translation. POSB Members
implement quantitative methodologies for the effective prioritization of patient-specific treatments by integrating
both emergent cancer systems biology approaches and mainstream strategies. As a result, the POSB
Program’s interrelated Specific Aims revolve around the following: (1) Regulatory and Signaling Networks; (2)
Tumor Heterogeneity and Plasticity; and (3) Precision Oncology. PSOB members have developed and translated
innovative systems biology tools with evidence of novel NY State CLIA certified tests and a broad portfolio of
mechanism-based, precision oncology clinical studies, including innovative N-of-1 basket trials.
The POSB Program has a strong portfolio of NCI and other cancer relevant funding. In 2019, members had a
total of $10.6M in cancer-focused, peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which $6.8M (64%) was from NCI,
$2.8M (27%) was from other NIH sources, and almost $1M (9%) was from other peer-reviewing agencies. POSB
Members authored 1,064 cancer-relevant publications, of which 164 (15%) were intra-programmatic and 268
(25%) were interprogrammatic. Strikingly, 20% appeared in journals with a high impact factor (greater than 10)
of which half were in journals with an impact factor of 20 or higher. The POSB Program has significant strength
in leading both institutional and multicenter interventional trials. During the project period the POSB Program
had 1,180 interventional enrollments of which 52% were to investigator-initiated trials. Under-represented
minority and underserved patients’ accrual to interventional clinical trials is a particular strength of the POSB
Program and is 29%."
10880406,"CANCER POPULATION SCIENCE PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of the Cancer Population Science (CPS) Program is to reduce the burden from cancer
on a population level. Given that goal, the CPS Program conducts observational, cohort, and interventional
studies that focus on primary prevention, early detection, health outcomes, and the delivery of cancer care to
diverse communities and populations affected, or potentially affected, by cancer. The CPS program is led by
Dawn Hershman, MD, MS and co-led by Mary Beth Terry, PhD and Regina Santella, PhD; each is a
nationally renowned leader in her discipline with a durable track record of mentorship. The CPS program
comprises 44 members, crossing three schools and representing 18 departments, with expertise across the
lifespan, and research a broad spectrum of cancer diagnoses. The CPS program has four interrelated Specific
Aims that cross the Cancer Care Continuum: (1) Etiology and Primary Prevention: Investigate environmental,
lifestyle and genetic factors that impact cancer risk across the lifespan in healthy populations to improve primary
prevention; (2) Risk Assessment and Early Detection: Integrate molecular- genetic- and imaging-based
biomarkers into clinical risk assessment and early detection; (3) Health Outcomes and Cancer Care Delivery:
Study patterns of cancer care to inform cost-effective cancer treatment and care delivery interventions and policy
initiatives aimed at patients, providers, and health systems; (4) Cancer Control: Discover strategies and translate
them to pathway and data-driven trials for patients living with cancer, with a specific focus on symptom
management, cancer survivorship and palliative care. In 2019, the CPS program had a total of $14M in cancer-
focused, peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which almost $4M (27%) was from NCI, $5.5M (38%) was from
other NIH sources, and $4.8M (34%) from other peer-reviewing agencies. During the project period, members
authored a total of 1,050 cancer relevant publications, of which 316 (30%) were intra-programmatic, 230 (22%)
were inter-programmatic, and 11% in high-impact journals with an impact factor of >10. In addition to numerous
epidemiologic and cohort studies, the CPS Program has strengths in leading both institutional and multicenter
interventional trials. During the project period the CPS program, had 947 interventional enrollments of which
85% were to investigator-initiated trials. CPS Program members also led and completed seven NCORP/NCTN
multicenter trials with an additional eight trials continuing to accrue at multiple sites. Under-represented minority
patients’ accrual to interventional trials is a particular strength of the CPS program and is 65%. The HICCC has
provided support, totaling close to $3M, and resources to foster the growth and development of the CPS Program
as a future strategic priority. Over the next project period we will continue to recruit new faculty based upon
strategic priorities, develop new initiatives in implementation and dissemination research, continue to lead
NCORP and other NCI initiatives and foster the development of trainees and junior faculty."
10880407,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION: PROJECT SUMMARY
The vision of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) is that discoveries here will end cancer
everywhere. This is achieved through a dynamic, multi-pronged mission: (1) foster discovery science, (2)
translate discovery science into innovative clinical trials and interdisciplinary clinical care, and (3) promote
bidirectional community outreach and engagement, all of which is promulgated through a Strategic Plan. The
goals of Leadership, Planning, and Evaluation (LPE) are to create and sustain this vision by nurturing an
innovative and nimble leadership team, buttressed by internal and external advisory groups, and inclusion of the
HICCC membership for the identification and prioritization of new opportunities. The HICCC furthermore charges
its leadership and advisory bodies to develop and maintain the Strategic Plan, which interdigitates with the
institutional Strategic Plan.
Leading the HICCC’s leadership, planning and evaluation activities is the Director, Anil K. Rustgi, MD, a
nationally known translational researcher who was recruited last year from the University of Pennsylvania’s
Abramson Cancer Center. Rustgi is supported by a highly experienced and cohesive team of Senior Leadership
that includes a Deputy Director and six Associate Directors. Together, this team comprises the Senior Leadership
Team (SLT). The SLT actively engages Program Leaders and a core of internal advisors in strategy and decision
making through Cancer Center Leadership Team (CCLT) meetings, where strategic and operational matters are
discussed and recommendations made to the Center Director. A highly productive committee structure, which
includes an Internal Advisory Board (IAB), External Advisory Board (EAB), Community Advisory Board (CAB),
and Cancer Research Career Enhancement (CRCE) Committee, complements HICCC leadership and allows
for diverse perspectives to help shape and guide the future of the HICCC.
Under Rustgi, the HICCC has set forth a new vision, which will help realize the Cancer Center’s full potential
over the next project period and beyond. Concurrently, care was taken to ensure that the HICCC continuously
responds to the CCSG Summary Statement, changing expectations for NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer
Centers, and ongoing feedback and guidance from the IAB, EAB, CAB, and others. All contributors have
enthusiastically endorsed the Strategic Plan, along with the initiatives that have been identified for the years
ahead. The current LPE, which is hallmarked by active listening, inclusion, and an unyielding commitment to
serving the community, has resulted in a time of unprecedented growth. This is evidenced throughout the
application in the accomplishments and plans for Research Programs, COE, Shared Resources, and CRCE,
including noteworthy accomplishments in translation by bringing HICCC discoveries into the clinic."
10880408,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS: PROJECT SUMMARY
Developmental Funds are critical to promote synergistic, collaborative research that is aligned with the Herbert
Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) strategic plan and fueled by our Catchment Area. The HICCC
continues to utilize Developmental Funds in a strategic manner, facilitating high-priority research with high
probability of external grant funding, fostering the research careers of junior investigators, facilitating team
science, increasing translational and clinical research, and promoting new research areas relevant to the
Catchment Area. During the project period, HICCC invested a total of $4.4M in 39 pilot projects. Of this total,
$856,000 in Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) Developmental Funds funded 14 pilot projects. These
projects have led to $15.3M in external grant funding, a nearly 18-fold return on investment. From 2017 to 2019,
HICCC also funded 15 pilots using $2.1M non-CCSG funds made possible through philanthropy and industry
funding. A new funding partnership in 2019, with the Emerson Collective Cancer Research Fund, provided an
additional $1.44M which funded nine high-risk, high-reward projects in its first year. Lastly, $17M in non-CCSG
Developmental Funds, derived from a combination of institutional, philanthropic, and industry funds, were used
for Shared Resources.
In this application, the HICCC requests $300,000 per year in Developmental Funds, an increase of $123,000
per year and 7% of the total CCSG budget request (direct costs). These funds will be utilized to meet the following
interrelated Specific Aims: (1) Award pilot projects to HICCC investigators to promote team science, high
risk/high reward ideas, junior investigators, and pre-clinical and clinical concepts; (2) Invest in Shared Resources
in order to support leading-edge research and priorities set forth in the 2019-2025 strategic plan; and (3) Support
the planning of multi-investigator grants (e.g. P01, U01/U54, SPOREs) that aim to foster transdisciplinary
collaboration."
10901070,"Project Summary
 Bacteriophages, phages for short, are extremely abundant and diverse in the environment but
also very under sampled and understudied. A major factor limiting the characterization of more phages
is the lack of fast and efficient methods to do so. Alghough, techniques have been developed to find the
receptor of a given phage on its host cell, no techniques to find phages dependent on a given receptor
have been developed. However, this second method may be even more important. Such a technique
would allow a user to select a bacterial membrane protein or structure of interest and preferentially
select environmental phages that require it for infection. This could be useful for understanding the
fluctuations of bacterial membrane structures across different ecological systems or for informing which
environmental phages will make the best therapies.
 This proposal will develop a novel and generalizable assay for receptor-guided discovery
of environmental phages using co-culture. The current standard technique includes a classic plaque
assay where a single host strain of bacteria is grown in a lawn with an environmental sample of
phages. Each phage infecting the host bacteria causes a clearing in the lawn called a plaque, and
unique phages are not identifiable based on the appearance of the resulting plaques. The novel assay
proposed here adds a new visual signal by co-culturing multiple strains of bacteria in the lawn. Each
strain is a single gene knockout and tagged with a unique fluorescent maker. Phages with infection
cycles independent of any of the proteins knocked out will lyse every strain on the plate and leave no
fluorescent signal in the plaque. Phages of interest will lyse only a subset of the bacterial strains in the
lawn, and the fluorescent signal corresponding to the required protein knockout will show through the
plaque. In this way the novel assay differentiates plaques by the dependencies of the original infecting
phage and allows for targeted isolation of phages of interest in just one experimental step. This project
will be completed in a highly interdisciplinary environment where the experimental protocols,
computational analysis, and hardware can all be developed with equal rigor.
 This assay will be developed first in Escherichia coli as a model system and then generalized
into Pseudomonas aeruginosa to move towards clinical applications. Knockout proteins will be chosen
first to test the limits of the assay and later to search for interactions between phages and bacterial
virulence and antibiotic resistance factors. Taken together, this work will develop a novel assay for
targeted phage isolation that can be applied to ecological studies, single phage therapies, and
construction of phage cocktails."
10901073,"Project Summary
 Regulating mRNA in space and time is an ancient, conserved operation cells perform to precisely
coordinate the flow of genetic information available for translation. RNA transcription, localization and local
translation is implicated in neuronal outgrowth, plasticity, and repair, and dysregulation of these RNA processes
leads to diverse neurological disorders. Mutations in several RNA binding proteins are associated with
neurodevelopmental diseases and axon defects, yet the role of mRNA regulation in synaptogenesis remains
unclear. Additionally, most neuronal RNA localization studies focus on postsynaptic compartments, and very
few studies have been conducted in vivo in the context of intact physiology. This project takes advantage of the
genetic accessibility and transparency of the nematode C. elegans to investigate mRNA regulation as
synaptogenesis occurs in the living animal, focusing on the conserved essential presynaptic active zone gene
syd-2/liprin-alpha. This will be accomplished using a combination of high-resolution imaging and mass
spectrometry, which will characterize the dynamics of syd-2 mRNA and identify novel candidates of mRNA
regulation at the transcriptional and trafficking level. Proof-of-principle preliminary data suggests that live
imaging of endogenous RNA transcription and mRNA granule movement can be performed in neurons of the
intact worm using the MS2 binding site/MS2 coat protein system to label endogenous mRNA with fluorescent
proteins. Ongoing work will pair this system with an active zone marker, an orthologous high-resolution protein
imaging system, and a proximity labeling enzyme to probe the relationship between mRNA regulation and
synaptogenesis and uncover novel regulatory mechanisms. Studying neuronal mRNA regulation using
complementary live imaging and unbiased biochemical approaches like mass spectrometry will reveal how
these complex neurodevelopmental processes are coordinated and identify regulatory candidates for future
therapeutic targeting. The studies proposed here (via a co-mentorship) will synergize Singer lab RNA imaging
technology with Kurshan lab expertise in presynaptic assembly to further our understanding of neuronal mRNA
regulation in living organisms. This proposal will facilitate the achievement of Jackson’s career goal to become
an excellent physician-scientist and leader of a laboratory, harnessing the exceptional learning environment of
Albert Einstein College of Medicine to foster his scientific and professional growth."
10901288,"We propose to develop and evaluate robust deep learning (DL)-based approaches capable of
accurately delineating target volumes and predicting recurrence in head and neck cancer (HNC)
patients. Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the most common treatments for HNC patients. Advanced
RT techniques enable highly conformal dose delivery to target volumes. However, a major challenge
in the RT planning for HNC is delineating target tumor volumes. Despite the availability of consensus
guidelines, delineating the gross target volume (GTV) and the clinical target volume (CTV) for HNC is
time-consuming and requires extensive clinical expertise. It demands a comprehensive understanding
of the region's intricate anatomy, tumor histology, and spread patterns. Precise delineation of target
volumes, especially the CTV, is essential to avoid marginal misses and excess doses to organs at risk
(OARs). Also, existing DL target volume delineation algorithms have predominantly focused on the
GTV delineation of oropharyngeal cancer, neglecting other commonly encountered tumor subsites,
such as laryngeal and nasopharyngeal cancers, which represent ~30% of HNC. Another challenge in
HNC management is the high recurrence rate. There is a daunting 30% five-year recurrence rate, with
at least 50% occurring in-field, despite comprehensive treatment strategies encompassing surgery,
chemotherapy, and RT. 18F-FDG-PET/CT has become part of the standard of care for HNC thanks to
its ability to improve the accuracy of GTV delineation, reveal previously undiagnosed regional nodal
disease, and contribute to a decrease in inter- and intra- observer variability (IOV) in GTV delineation.
However, most DL algorithms have used contours derived from a single physician as the gold standard
(label), failing to capture IOV in tumor delineation, an essential component of robust DL strategies. We
will develop robust delineation algorithms capable of accurately delineating both GTV and CTV in
various HNC locations in both primary and recurrent settings. We propose diffusion-based DL
algorithms to delineate GTV and CTV from 18F-FDG-PET and contrast-enhanced CT, while capturing
observer variability. We will also develop a DL method that incorporates imaging and clinical
information to predict recurrence and whether recurrence will occur in-field."
10901440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common monogenetic cause of kidney
failure. It affects ~1 in 500 to 1,000 live births, with ~50% of patients needing dialysis or renal transplantation by
age 60 years of age. Mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 genes account for >90% of ADPKD cases, and involves
reduction/loss of functional ADPKD proteins, polycystins (PCs), in the sensory organelle, primary cilium. Growing
evidence suggests that enhancing the ciliary dosage and/or function of PCs could slow down ADPKD
progression. Thus, understanding mechanisms regulating the compartmentalized availability and functionality of
PCs in primary cilia is vital for developing more effective and safer treatments, as the current FDA-approved
drug, Tolvaptan, has limited benefits and significant side effects.
 The long-term goal of our research is to understand how the anti-cystogenesis function of PCs is
compartmentalized in primary cilia and how it is specifically regulated. We have identified novel players involved
in the ciliary trafficking and function of PCs. The current proposal addresses three questions: Aim 1, Investigate
how the HYLS1-PIPKIg axis regulates the ciliary base docking of vesicles carrying PCs. Aim 2, Delineate how
the NEK8-centered inversin compartment enables the ciliary entry of PCs. Aim 3, Determine the pathogenic
impact of GPR161-mediated cAMP synthesis and PKA activation in primary cilia when PCs are depleted. We
will employ gain-of-function, loss-of-function, and suppression-rescue approaches by applying gene editing tools
in renal epithelial cell models carrying ADPKD-related mutations. Fluorescence microscopy including super-
resolution and live-cell imaging will be used to analyze protein and lipid localization, level, and dynamics in
primary cilia. We will determine whether changing the ciliary functional level of PCs can affect renal cystogenesis
in Pkd1RC/RC mice that mimic the adult onset ADPKD condition. With this proposal, we aim to identify key
molecules that regulate the functional level of PCs in cilia and their roles in ADPKD pathogenesis. These results
may uncover novel molecules or pathways that can be targeted for PKD treatment. In the long term, our studies
will inspire future research on enhancing the functionality of PCs in cilia to counteract the pathogenic defects in
ADPKD."
10902425,"Project Summary
T cells are central effectors of adaptive immunity, mediating critical defenses against infections and cancer.
Aberrant T cell activation is associated with autoimmune diseases and immunodeficiency disorders. To elicit
proper immune responses upon antigenic stimulation, T cell activation must be tightly regulated to integrate and
transduce signals detected at the plasma membrane. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms regulating
this transduction are not fully understood. Recent reports have demonstrated that key T cell signal transduction
proteins form biomolecular condensates at the T cell immunological synapse via liquid-liquid phase separation.
Specifically, the transmembrane adaptor protein Linker for Activation of T cells (LAT), which is essential for T
cell activation, is phosphorylated upon T cell receptor ligation. Phosphorylated LAT produces multiple
interactions with multivalent effector proteins, including Grb2 and Sos1, which lead to assembly of condensates
with fluid properties in vitro and in living cells. How LAT condensate assembly and disassembly are regulated
and how LAT condensates regulate T cell signaling in cells is unknown. Notably, LAT is recruited to ordered,
cholesterol-rich membrane domains known as lipid rafts, and such recruitment has been implicated in T cell
activation. Since LAT is involved in both membrane rafts and condensate assembly, I hypothesize that the
interplay between membrane rafts and LAT condensates tunes T cell signaling. My preliminary data supports
this hypothesis both in vitro and in Jurkat T cells. The goal of this proposal is to understand how LAT condensates
couple to membrane rafts to cooperatively regulate T cell signaling. Our overall hypothesis is that the LAT
mediates biophysical and functional coupling between membrane rafts and condensates to regulate T
cell activation. To evaluate how LAT condensate assembly mediates membrane lipid organization, experiments
proposed in Aim 1 will characterize the biophysical properties of membranes coupled to LAT condensates both
in vitro and in live cells. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of membrane lipid remodeling on LAT condensate
properties and downstream T cell signaling upon antigenic stimulation. To this end, in vitro reconstituted
membrane models are used to precisely manipulate lipid composition to study the effect on LAT condensate
formation. These studies will be complemented by dietary lipid supplementation or pharmacological
manipulations in live cells to study the effect of membrane lipid remodeling on LAT condensate assembly, and
how it regulates signaling pathways downstream of TCR engagement. Successful completion of this work will
provide evidence and mechanistic insights on how membrane rafts and LAT condensates mutually regulate to
tune T cell signaling. These findings will advance our understanding of spatiotemporal regulation of T cell
activation, thereby can potentially shed light on novel therapeutic strategies against autoimmune diseases and
improve immunotherapy using engineered T cells."

In stark contrast to the widespread prevalence and devastating outcomes associated with alcohol use disorder,
currently available treatment options are only moderately effective. The large heterogeneity in AUD presentations
may obfuscate etiology and individualized treatment options. In this 5-year K01 mentored research scientist
award application, I propose to characterize the behavioral, molecular, and genetic correlates of AUD biotypes
(subtypes determined by biology) across the lifespan. To this end, I will apply semi-supervised machine learning
algorithms to structural brain imaging data from the largest available AUD and alcohol use datasets from
childhood to old age (total n=61,428). I will examine the stability of these biotypes across the lifespan, including
among substance-naïve children and adults with heavy alcohol use, as well as their correlates with
neurobehavioral stage-based constructs of addiction (i.e., impulsivity, negative affect, cognition) and with alcohol
involvement trajectories. I will then conduct a genome-wide association study of AUD biotypes to disarticulate
their genetic architecture, genetic correlates, and potential molecular pathways that may be leveraged for drug
repositioning. This grant develops my skillsets in semi-supervised machine learning, AUD heterogeneous
presentations, multivariate genome-wide methods, and multi-omic analytic approaches. These skill sets will
serve as a backdrop for a planned R01 submission that will leverage my background in large-scale data analysis
to translate across biological modalities in substance use research."
10894947,"Abstract
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the etiologic agent of cervical cancer, as well as anogenital and oropharyngeal
cancers. It is also the most common sexually transmitted infection. Despite the availability of prophylactic
vaccines, there are no effective antivirals against active HPV infection. Illuminating the cellular basis of HPV
infection is therefore crucial to therapeutic development. Upon receptor-mediated endocytosis, HPV is
trafficked to the endosome, the Golgi, and then the nucleus to cause infection. How HPV navigates through
this endomembranous network of the host cell remains mysterious. Although recent studies have suggested a
role of the host motor dynein in HPV entry, the molecular mechanism by which dynein promotes HPV infection
remains unclear. Our preliminary data identified two dynein “cargo adaptors” – the endosome-localized FIP3
and the Golgi-localized BICD2 - as critical host factors during HPV infection. These results suggest that HPV
hijacks distinct dynein-cargo adaptor complexes at different entry steps to successfully reach the nucleus.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the dynein-FIP3 adaptor complex is exploited to transport HPV
from the endosome to the Golgi (Aim 1), while the dynein-BICD2 adaptor complex traffics the virus from the
Golgi to the nucleus (Aim 2). We will use biochemical, cell-based, and genetic approaches, under loss-of-
function conditions, to elucidate the mechanism by which the dynein-adaptor complex drives viral transport.
We anticipate that clarifying the role of host components in HPV entry will provide novel strategies to combat
HPV-induced diseases."

 Continued access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is crucial for pediatric populations
living with HIV to prevent AIDS-related comorbidities. However, there are several unique challenges to
treatment adherence in pediatric populations, including caregiver factors, and medication palatability and
tolerability. Little work has been done in characterizing patterns and factors related to the timing of ART
nonadherence since initiation of therapy in children. Additionally, new ART formulations available for adults
have been slower to obtain approval for use in pediatric populations due to difficulty in assessing efficacy in
trials. Bringing modern causal inference methods to the analyses of pediatric trials through rigorous
estimation of per-protocol effects can help overcome some of these difficulties, and help bring
analyses of pediatric trials into the modern age.
 The objectives of the proposal are to (1) characterize the barriers to pediatric dolutegravir
combination therapy adherence, and (2) estimate per-protocol effects of treatment failure by 96 weeks
in the pediatric HIV trial, taking into consideration the unique barriers to medication adherence in
pediatric populations. Data from the ODYSSEY trial, a phase II/II open-label non-inferiority trial assessing
dolutegravir-based ART compared to standard of care in an international sample of children aged 2 to 18, will
be used to characterize baseline and time varying factors influencing time to protocol deviation, and then
estimate per-protocol effects impacting 96-week treatment failure correcting for such protocol deviations
through implementation of modern causal inference methods and machine learning.
 The completion of the proposed aims will provide evidence on characteristics contributing to timing of
protocol deviation and estimates of per-protocol effects of treatment failure by 96 weeks corrected for such
protocol deviations in the ODYSSEY trial for first or second line dolutegravir use compared to standard of care
in a pediatric population. These results will (1) provide substantial information on factors related to
timing of eventual ART nonadherence so that appropriate clinical intervention can be developed to
prevent nonadherence related to these factors, and (2) provide an example of modern per-protocol
analyses in pediatric trials which will serve as guidelines for future per-protocol analyses in pediatric
trials. The training plan outlined in this F30 proposal will provide the applicant with necessary skills in modern
causal inference methods and clinical medicine to become a productive and successful physician scientist at
the intersection of pediatrics and application of modern causal inference methods for pediatric trials."

 There are reported sex differences in both the propensity to develop nicotine addiction and the efficacy
of treatment interventions pointing to women as a particularly vulnerable population. Thus, understanding how
sex differences in nicotine effects on the brain arise is a critical unanswered question in addiction
neuroscience. Dopamine signaling within the nucleus accumbens is involved in initiation and maintenance of
nicotine addiction, and dopamine release is sensitive to heavy modulation by acetylcholine through nicotinic
receptors located on dopamine axons. Acetylcholine modulation of dopamine release at distal axon terminals
is discussed extensively, and better understanding this interaction has driven experimentation across fields -
critically, we find that this interaction is not present in adult intact females. However, our preliminary data show
that this effect is rescued in females after ovariectomy, suggesting that ovarian hormones play a critical role
in modulating acetylcholine effects on dopamine release; the goal of this proposal is to define where
this modulation occurs and how this influences nicotine effects on this system.
 This proposal is guided by the overarching hypothesis that estradiol acts acutely through estrogen
receptors located within acetylcholine interneurons in the nucleus accumbens core to strengthen acetylcholine
effects on dopamine release. However, in intact females, long-term estrogen modulation of this interaction
leads to an inability of modulators – such as nicotine – to further enhance dopamine release. This is supported
by robust preliminary data showing that in males and ovariectomized females estradiol effects on dopamine
release can be blocked via nicotinic receptor antagonism. In intact females, estradiol effects on dopamine
release are blunted and insensitive to nicotinic receptor agonists and antagonists.
 This fellowship application describes a robust training plan to investigate the microcircuitry of how
ovarian hormones mediate dopamine-acetylcholine interactions and the role that this plays in attributing
motivational value to nicotine-associated cues. Aim 1 will define the estrogen receptor subtypes contributing to
estrogen effects on acetylcholine-dopamine interactions. Aim 2 will determine how estrogen receptors regulate
acetylcholine release using optical acetylcholine sensors. Aim 3 will use genetic approaches to knock out
estrogen receptors from acetylcholine interneurons and determine how this affects the ability of dopamine to
respond to nicotine and nicotine-associated cues in operant tasks. This plan expands on my current
electrophysiology expertise to train me on optogenetic tools and optical imaging and gives me the career
development opportunities necessary to propel me to a successful placement in a tenure-track position at a
respected institution. Together, the results of this project will critically inform the addiction field on the effects of
ovarian hormones on dopamine interactions in the nucleus accumbens core, providing new directions for more
effective treatment of addiction.

 Recent advances in cell biology have implicated metabolism in diseases ranging from cancer to heart
failure. The cellular hubs of metabolism, mitochondria, are often called the “powerhouses of the cell,” and have
become an attractive therapeutic target for these common diseases. Patients suffering from mitochondrial
disease also stand to benefit from mitochondrially-targeted therapeutics. However, currently, our ability to
influence mitochondrial function therapeutically is limited. Uncovering how mitochondria regulate energy
production in normal conditions will provide the groundwork for the development of future treatment strategies.
 The mitochondrial acyl carrier protein (mtACP) sits at the intersection of nutrient inputs and energy
expenditure in the mitochondria. The acylated form of mtACP both serves as a source for citric acid cycle (TCA)
enzyme activation via lipoylation, as well as a stabilization factor in electron transport chain assembly, controlling
the two major arms of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Despite its central role in oxidative metabolism, how
acyl-mtACP is formed in the mitochondria is poorly defined. Acyl-mtACP formation relies on a 4’-
phosphopantetheine (4’-PP) modification, followed by the addition of 2-carbon units from malonyl-CoA
decarboxylation via de novo mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFAS). The enzyme responsible for mtACP 4’-
phosphopantethenylation in vivo is not known, and the subcellular compartment where this occurs is undefined
yet has major implications for the regulation of this process. Finally, the carbon substrate of mtFAS is highly
disputed. The carbon source for mtACP acylation has huge implications for the regulation of mtACP and therefore
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Our preliminary analyses indicate that mtACP is 4’-
phosphopantetheinylated in the mitochondria by the only known mammalian PPTase: AASDHPPT, and that
mitochondrial acetyl-CoA provides carbon for acylation of mtACP by mtFAS. The experiments in this proposal
will definitively explain how mtACP is activated (4’-PP) and how the acylation substrate (malonyl-CoA) is
generated, thus providing a clearer picture of upstream regulation of mtACP in mammalian mitochondria.
Understanding the key enzymes in mtACP activation and their activity in cells will provide the foundation for
future studies that seek to modulate mtACP activity in patients with mitochondrial dysfunction.
 The proposed study will be conducted as part of the applicant’s training in a joint MD-PhD program
through Michigan State University College of Human Medicine and the Van Andel Insitute. The Van Andel Insitute
provides PhD training in a small and collaborative environment with world-class scientists and state-of-the art
facilities. The applicant will receive mentorship from leading experts in the field of metabolism, metabolomics,
and cell biology, as well as complete support for continued clinical activity, collaboration across scientific
disciplines, and professional development throughout the degree program."

According to NIDCR, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders affect up to 12% of the population and are a major
priority for further research. The high incidence in children is unusual for a chronic pain condition, suggesting a
significant developmental origin. TMJ development involves precise patterning of the mandibular bony processes
and diverse connective tissues including the fibrous disc, stabilizing ligaments, and tendons that connect to jaw
muscles. Skeletal and soft connective tissue structures of the TMJ derive from cranial neural crest cells, yet how
cell fate decisions are balanced to generate the correct tissues with spatial precision remains unresolved. In a
previously funded R21, PIs Gage Crump and Amy Merrill combined single-cell omics with zebrafish and mouse
genetics to identify a new function of the nuclear receptor Nr5a2 in promoting connective tissue at the expense
of skeletal fates at the developing TMJ. However, the identity of the stem/progenitor cells for TMJ connective
tissues, and how they differ from skeletal stem cells, was unknown. Here, by analyzing new single-cell data of
the developing mouse TMJ, we have identified the R-spondin receptors LGRs as markers of jaw connective
tissue stem cells. Compared to roles in epithelial stem cell biology, potential roles of LGRs in mesenchymal
tissues have been understudied. We propose that LGRs function to maintain the stem pool for sustained
connective tissue generation at the TMJ by potentiating locally high Wnt signaling. In Aim 1, we will perform
lineage tracing to test that Lgr4 and Lgr5 in mouse, and Lgr4 and Lgr6 in zebrafish, mark connective tissue stem
cells at both embryonic and postnatal stages. We will also use targeted ablation to test the requirement of Lgr5+
cells for TMJ connective tissue development and postnatal growth. In Aim 2, we will perform real-time in vivo
imaging in developing zebrafish to test that connective tissue progenitors transition from a high to low Wnt state
as they differentiate into tendons and ligaments. We will then use conditional mouse genetics to test our model
that sustaining Wnt signaling in Lgr5+ cells disrupts differentiation by locking cells in a stem cell state, and
reciprocally blocking canonical Wnt signaling in Lgr5+ cells depletes stem cells and causes a failure to sustain
connective tissue development. In Aim 3, we use mouse Lgr4 and Lgr5 floxed alleles provided by our
collaborators at Novartis, and newly generated zebrafish lgr4 and lgr6 CRISPR mutants, to test that LGRs are
redundantly required in Lgr5+ cells for high Wnt signaling and maintenance of connective tissue progenitors. We
then test whether restoring Wnt signaling levels through genetic or pharmacological means can rescue
connective tissue defects in LGR mutants. Strengths of the proposal include the PI team with complementary
expertise in zebrafish and mouse models, unique single-cell datasets of the fish jaw and mouse TMJ, and
sophisticated in vivo imaging and genetic tools in both species to enable mechanistic understanding of jaw
connective tissue differentiation. Our work will reveal how alterations to Wnt and stem cell function impact the
balance of skeletal and connective tissue formation, potentially predisposing to TMJ disorders."
10906058,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 1 
Screening mammography results in lower breast cancer mortality by reducing the incidence of advanced breast cancer. Advanced cancer occurs in about 22% of routinely screened women diagnosed with breast cancer, with advanced cancer rates more than 2-fold higher in Black vs. White women. We have identified advanced cancer rate as a key screening outcome because it best discriminates who has the highest risk of breast cancer death. Identifying women at increased advanced cancer risk and targeting them with effective screening strategies could reduce breast cancer mortality. Thus, Project 1 aims to advance a new risk-based screening paradigm that identifies women’s absolute advanced cancer risk to inform screening intensity and supplemental imaging decisions. Aim 1) Using Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data on screening exams from women aged 40-74 years, and advanced breast cancers, we will develop, evaluate, and validate new risk prediction models to identify women at high risk of advanced breast cancer. We will combine clinical breast cancer risk factors, self-reported race/ethnicity, imaging features, and Artificial Intelligence output to estimate cumulative 6-year advanced cancer risk using novel discrete time survival models incorporating modern data-adaptive modeling approaches for annual and biennial screeners and examine model predictive equity by race/ethnicity. Aim 2) We will statistically emulate a randomized trial within a causal inference framework to evaluate annual vs. biennial mammography screening on breast cancer mortality among the general screening population according to advanced cancer risk. Aim 3) Three established breast cancer simulation models will be used to evaluate the long-term benefits (breast cancer deaths averted, and life years gained) and harms (e.g., false positives and biopsies) of population-level screening strategies that target mammography frequency (annual, biennial) and supplemental MRI based on advanced cancer risk. This proposal will answer: 1) Which women undergoing screening mammography are at high risk of advanced cancer and require an alternative strategy to biennial mammography, and which women are at low risk and can be screened less often? 2) What advanced cancer risk levels require annual mammography vs. biennial mammography for similar reductions in breast cancer mortality? 3) Does a risk-based screening strategy using advanced cancer risk to inform screening frequency and modality improve outcomes compared to an agebased strategy? Therefore, this project will provide evidence to guide women and providers towards equitable screening strategies based on advanced cancer risk to maximize screening benefits while minimizing harms."
10906060,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 2 
Underserved breast cancer screening populations, including those that are predominantly composed of racial/ethnic minorities, lower income, lower educated, and rural populations, continue to have a higher breast cancer morbidity and mortality burden than their counterparts. These populations tend to have lower follow-up rates after abnormal screening, more missed cancers, and more advanced stage disease at the time of diagnosis. Drivers of inequities are likely multi-factorial and include not only woman-level enabling factors but also neighborhood-level social determinants of health and facility-level factors that influence access to and use of high quality screening, timely diagnostic evaluation, and treatment. The National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities, on behalf of the NIH, reports that a major barrier in achieving health equity is that prior disparities research efforts have focused on individual enabling factors rather than neighborhood or healthcare delivery factors. Understanding the impact of breast imaging facility-level drivers of inequities is particularly important as new screening technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), are rapidly adopted in clinical practice. If newer technologies do not diffuse equitably across communities, persistent breast cancer disparities may be further exacerbated. Our overall project objective is to identify modifiable breast imaging facility-level factors that drive breast cancer screening disparities. Using an observational cohort study design and simulation modeling, we will explore how targeted facility-level changes that aim to increase access to and use of routine screening and targeted use of AI for improved imaging interpretation accuracy can promote greater equity in screening outcomes. We will leverage the robust, longitudinal, multi-level Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data across eight regional U.S. breast imaging registries to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1) Perform multi-level analyses to identify facility-level factors (e.g., on-site technologies) that drive disparities in screening performance and outcomes. Aim 2) Using a retrospective matched case control design and five commercially available AI technologies, evaluate whether commercially available AI tools for automated mammography interpretation can aid low-performing facilities to meet or exceed national mammography performance benchmarks. Aim 3) Using three established microsimulation models and results from Aims 1 and 2, estimate the long-term, population-level benefits, harms, and costs of enacting facility-level quality-of-care interventions (e.g., AI for higher performance) for the overall U.S. screening population and for underserved subpopulations. Elevating the quality-of-care at low-performing facilities has the potential to tip the balance towards greater screening benefits and less harms at the population-level, while also promoting health equity."
10906063,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 3 
The incidence of second breast cancer in survivors is seven times higher than first breast cancer incidence in women without this history; these cancers are associated with increased morbidity and breast-cancer specific mortality. Annual surveillance mammography is recommended for survivors for early detection of a second breast cancer to reduce morbidity and mortality. However, surveillance mammography is imperfect. Survivors have 4x higher surveillance failure rates (cancers diagnosed within 12 months of a negative mammogram) than women without a history of breast cancer. Project 3’s overarching goal is to reduce surveillance failures in breast cancer survivors through equitably predicting women at high risk of a surveillance failure (i.e., interval 2nd breast cancer), improving cancer detection through artificial intelligence (AI), and examining social determinants of health as multilevel drivers of surveillance failures and targets for future interventions. Having an accurate surveillance failure risk prediction tool across broad populations of survivors would support a future of targeted surveillance imaging. Understanding whether predictive performance differs by race is critical to validating an accurate risk prediction model. External validation is also key to ensuring the generalizability of the model. Additionally, acceptability of future risk-based surveillance strategies for referring physicians and women is important to consider and has not yet been evaluated. In the current P01, we developed the first risk model of surveillance failures that can be applied to individual survivors. In the next funding cycle, our Aim 1 will address feasibility of adopting the BCSC 5-year surveillance failure risk prediction model by assessing performance equity by race group external generalizability, and acceptability. Our Aim 2 will evaluate whether AI algorithms improve sensitivity at a fixed specificity equivalent to that of BCSC radiologists. Commercially available AI algorithms for mammography interpretation are already being implemented. However, these algorithms were developed in screening populations and have not yet been validated in survivors. Lastly, our Aim 3 will identify the relative contribution of selected multilevel social determinants of health that contribute to surveillance failures. Multiple studies have shown social determinants of health including income, education, housing, and race are associated with higher rates of second breast cancers and mortality. No prior study has evaluated how multilevel social determinants of health that may be amenable to intervention are associated with interval second breast cancers in survivors. Understanding the relative contribution of multilevel factors to surveillance failures can be used to guide future targeted interventions to decrease surveillance failures. Together, this Project will generate evidence to improve surveillance through a multipronged effort to reduce surveillance failures at the points of risk stratification and imaging interpretation, and an overall examination of key social determinants of health as multilevel drivers of surveillance failure and targets for future interventions."
10906065,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Administrative Core 
This Program Project renewal, “Advancing Equitable Risk-based Breast Cancer Screening and Surveillance in Community Practice,” is a complex undertaking involving three research Projects, three Cores, seven breast imaging registries that will collect new data from 116 participating imaging facilities and images from 30 facilities, a Statistical Coordinating Center, and multiple committees – all must work closely together seamlessly to ensure success. The Administrative Core will be the operational backbone of the Program, assisting the Projects and Cores in achieving their aims, and facilitating a collaborative environment to ensure that the Program functions efficiently and productively. The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) has developed an effective model for Program management and integration, demonstrated by the success and productivity of the current Program upon which this renewal builds. The Administrative Core team will continue to use this organizational model based on principles of team science to centralize coordination, communication, and integration among the Projects and Cores. Activities will include providing overall scientific leadership, fiscal oversight, and administrative support by setting timelines and milestones, planning virtual and in-person program meetings, and overseeing Project and Core budgets and deliverables. The Administrative Core will standardize and facilitate inter-Project collaboration by maintaining and monitoring established policies and procedures that ensure fairness and authorship opportunities for all investigators. The Core will assess Program performance through an annual evaluation, and develop and implement improvement plans to overcome any challenges. The Core will continue to support effective communication strategies for disseminating research findings and mechanisms to encourage and facilitate data sharing with external investigators. The Administrative Core specific aims are: Aim 1) Maintain centralized coordination of the Program’s logistical and financial requirements; and Aim 2) Provide integrative support to Projects and Cores by promoting collaborations to create synergy within the Program. Together, with integration and support from the Administrative Core, the Projects and Cores will efficiently achieve multiple, related research goals united by a common theme by sharing methods, data, and results. The BCSC has 25 years of experience in collaborative, multi-site research, including 9 successful years under this P01 mechanism. With our team’s experience in breast cancer research, leadership, multisite collaboration, data sharing, and overall research program coordination, we are well-positioned to continue providing all necessary management and integration to continue and extend this Program’s success."
10906068,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Biostatistics and Data Management Core 
The Biostatistics and Data Management (BDM) Core will support all Projects and the Comparative Effectiveness (CE) Core by providing centralized coordination of high-quality data collection, management, analysis, and sharing. The BDM Core includes six current (5 of which will collect new data) and two new Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) breast imaging registries and a central Statistical Coordinating Center (SCC). The Core will increase efficiency by providing Projects with data collected from a common cohort of women and sharing novel statistical methods performed by a single analytical support team. The specific aims are to: (1) collect, pool, manage, and share high-quality data required to meet Project aims; (2) expand the BCSC data resource by linking BCSC data to woman- and facility-level measures of social determinants of health and artificial intelligence algorithm scores; and (3) collaborate with Program investigators to implement sound and efficient study designs and perform valid statistical analyses that address each Project aim. The BDM Core will accomplish these aims using existing and new data collected on 2.9 million women (including 81,000 breast cancer survivors with surveillance imaging) from 235 current and 44 new BCSC breast imaging facilities. The BCSC registries have built strong relationships with the participating breast imaging facilities and have established secure procedures for data collection and linkage. Data will be pooled and analyzed by the SCC, which has extensive experience in data management, analyzing complex longitudinal observational data, risk prediction modeling, and developing novel statistical methods as needed to overcome the limitations of existing methods. Following the BCSC’s well-established collaborative research policies and procedures, the BDM Core will continue its successes in sharing data with the broader research community. Using the unique set of resources available to the BCSC—our established and cohesive research network; integrated surveillance system of longitudinal, individual-level data on women, radiologists, and facilities; infrastructure for accessing well-characterized study populations; and expertise in statistical methods and outcomes measurement in community settings—the BCSC registries and SCC will continue working together to support this Program project in answering key questions that cannot be addressed otherwise. These combined strengths ideally position the Program’s research teams to determine the most effective breast cancer screening and surveillance strategies in community practice."
10906071,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Comparative Effectiveness Core 
While technological advances have improved breast cancer screening and surveillance, breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death for women in the United States with documented racial and ethnic disparities in breast cancer mortality. Evidence on how best to improve care related to breast cancer screening and surveillance with a focus on reducing these disparities is lacking. The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) has unique data and an established infrastructure to document breast cancer screening and surveillance practice and performance among women in diverse community settings. Dartmouth College, where the Comparative Effectiveness (CE) Core is based, is a BCSC breast imaging registry site. Dartmouth has extensive resources and expertise in decision-analytic modeling methods and application, including an established collaboration with the NCI-funded Cancer Intervention and Surveillance modeling Network (CISNET). Furthermore, Dartmouth researchers pioneered and remain leaders in the study of cancer screening, risk communication, and overdiagnosis. The CE Core will provide specialized expertise in decision science, simulation modeling, risk communication, and qualitative research to efficiently support the Program’s comparative effectiveness and translational goals. In the next funding cycle, the CE Core will continue to provide comparative modeling services with three CISNET simulation models to translate short-term project results to a longer time horizon. Simulations will address the net benefits, harms, and equity impact of innovative breast cancer screening strategies that target screening at a woman level based on advanced cancer risk and will examine facility quality interventions aimed at improving screening use and performance in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2. In addition, qualitative research that will inform the clinical application of the Program’s innovative risk models will be used to identify barriers and facilitators of clinical adoption in collaboration with Project 3. The CE Core specific aims are to: 1) provide essential methodological expertise and model resources; 2) support evaluation of long-term comparative effectiveness of alternative woman-level screening strategies and facility-level quality intervention strategies to balance benefits, harms, and equity; 3) inform development and clinical application of the Program’s risk models for targeting breast imaging. Research supported by the CE Core will provide information on the most effective and equitable risk-based breast cancer screening and quality improvement strategies. Furthermore, CE Core supported findings will facilitate future dissemination and implementation studies focused on overcoming barriers to risk-based imaging. Centralization of modeling and other specialized services within the CE Core will enhance interactions across all Program components."

Down syndrome (DS) is caused by the inheritance of three rather than the expected two copies of
chromosome 21, or trisomy 21. DS is characterized by specific structural abnormalities in the brain, by a range
of cognitive deficits and intellectual disability, and by a significantly high risk of developing Alzheimer disease
by middle age. The rapid pace of progress in DS research that has taken place in the last decade highlights
the critical need for effective communication between scientists, clinicians, families and self-advocates to take
basic research discoveries from the laboratory to clinical trials that benefit people with DS. Advances in DS
research are not only driven by senior scientists but are dependent up on the nurturing of our next generation
of junior scientists. Thus, this application requests funding to cover travel expenses of American-based junior
investigators, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to attend the Fifth International conference of the
Trisomy 21 Research Society (T21RS). Attendees at this meeting will include established DS and non-DS
investigators whose research directly or indirectly informs critical aspects of DS cognition, neuropathology,
translational opportunities, and clinical trials. The meeting will take place in Rome, Italy from June 5 to June 8,
2024. Based on our previous successes, we anticipate that this conference will lead to fruitful discussions and
novel collaborations that are essential to define the future of DS research. The theme of our meeting will be
Promoting Research Experience in Down syndrome."

 The International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions
(MICCAI) is the major international conference in medical image computing, image-guided interventions and
robotics. It promotes, preserves, and facilitates research and education, and its proceedings foster the
exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge by leading institutions, scientists and physicians. The
conference is the result of the joint efforts of previous major conferences in three fields: Visualization in
Biomedical Computing (VBC), Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine (CVRMed), and
Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (MRCAS). Since its first edition in 1998, it has become the
premier conference in the field with its proceedings having citation scores comparable to high-impact journals.
Conference topics include, computer vision & image processing in medicine, computer-aided diagnosis,
computer-assisted interventions, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality,
biomedical imaging applications, and imaging systems, spanning disciplines such as radiology,
pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry.
 MICCAI includes three days of oral presentations, poster sessions and invited keynote talks. All paper
submissions undergo a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several papers have
become landmark publications with thousands of citations. Satellite events and educational initiatives with
similar attendance rates to the main conference also take place on the day before and after the conference in
the form of workshops, tutorials and challenges. MICCAI span the entire globe and, although it used to rotate
among the American, European, and Asian continents, there have been strong efforts to expand its outreach.
Product of those efforts will be the celebration of MICCAI 2024 in the African continent for the first time
(Marrakesh, Morocco). Attendees are typically from over 45 countries with strong student representation (40-
50% in the last editions). The MICCAI Society has also supported diversity, equity, inclusion and career
development initiatives. The “Women in MICCAI (WiM)” committee has promoted female participation and fair
and equitable career promotion. The “Reinforcing Inclusiveness & diverSity and Empowering MICCAI in Low-
to-Middle Income Countries (RISE)” initiative has worked towards strengthening the presence of minority
researchers from low-to-middle income countries. In addition, the Mentorship Program connects young
investigators with established scientists for advice in their careers. Along with these initiatives, this proposal
requests to support the attendance of US-based students and early career investigators through travel awards
to enhance diversity in conference attendance with focus on women, underrepresented minorities, students
with disabilities, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds. This support will provide minority groups
with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations."

 Social behaviors consist of a flexible seeking-approach phase followed by a social action phase. While
decades of elegant work have described specific subcortical circuits necessary for the execution of distinct
social actions (e.g. aggression and mating), the extent to which various nodes in the social brain network
encode specific social drives has been largely unexplored. Understanding this question will provide essential
insight into how the brain generates motivated states for specific social actions, which are essential both for
both survival and general well-being.
 The ventrolateral area (VMHvl) is one brain region that has been shown to play an essential role in
various social actions such as aggression and mating. Recent evidence suggests neural activity in this region
specifically generates and maintains aggressive-motivation states. However, whether this encoding is specific
for aggression, or represents a more generalized socially motivated state, is unknown. Here, we will test the
specific hypothesis that the VMHvl encodes signatures of motivation that are specific to desired future social
actions, against the alternative hypothesis, that social drive is generalized, and invariant to future social action.
To do this, I will employ a novel two-choice social operant paradigm which allows animals to freely switch
between seeking access for male or female social rewards. I will use this task along with state-of-the art high-
density neural recordings, activity-dependent tagging methods, functional perturbation experiments, and
single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) for a multiplexed analysis of VMHvl encoding of distinct social
drives. First, I will perform in vivo electrophysiological recordings to determine if and when social choices can
be predicted from VMHvl neural activity. Next, I will take advantage of a novel activity dependent tagging
methods to drive gene expression in VMHvl neurons active during disparate socially motivated states. Using
this tagging method to drive expression of opsins or fluorescent reporters, I test the functional specificity of
VMHvl neurons activated during distinct social drives and perform molecular profiling of these cells. Together,
this proposal combines multiple powerful techniques to yield new insights about the computational, functional,
and molecular specificity of a evolutionarily conserved hypothalamic node in generating specific social drives."

The use of noninvasive ultrasound for quantitative tissue characterization has been an exciting research prospect
for several decades now. Herein the challenge is to find hidden patterns in the ultrasound data to reveal more
information about tissue function and pathology that cannot be seen in the more conventional ultrasound images.
Bypassing some of the limitations associated with traditional tissue characterization approaches, a new modality
has emerged for the ultrasound classification of acoustic scatterers like cancer cells. Termed H-scan ultrasound
(where the ‘H’ stands for Hermite or hue), this innovative real-time imaging technique reveals the local frequency
dependence of different-sized scatterer aggregates found in soft tissue. Our preliminary preclinical findings using
in vivo H-scan ultrasound have indicated that this new imaging technique is useful for detecting apoptotic activity
and an early response to chemotherapy. Here changes in H-scan ultrasound image intensity were shown to
have a strong correlation to local cancer cell nuclear size. Guided by knowledge gained from these previous
studies, the purpose of the current research project is to develop a next-generation in vivo H-scan ultrasound
imaging system and tumor characterization method. Our first goal is to implement a multifrequency H-scan
ultrasound imaging functionality on programmable scanner equipped with a wideband capacitive micromachined
ultrasonic transducer (CMUT). This new ultrasound imaging technology will be tested and optimized using a
series of phantom materials embedded with scatterers of known size. Next, we will quantify success of H-scan
ultrasound imaging for monitoring an early response to chemotherapy using a preclinical model of breast cancer
that recapitulates human disease. We will then compare H-scan ultrasound findings to physical measurements
of cancer cell size and results obtained by competing imaging technologies. Lastly, we will conduct the first
human study of multifrequency H-scan ultrasound imaging of breast cancer and evaluate the potential for helping
with disease management."

Asthma and COPD respectively affect 25 million and 16 million people in the US. Chronic lower respiratory
diseases represented the fourth leading cause of death in the country before the pandemic. For these and
other pulmonary diseases like cystic fibrosis (CF), monitoring disease remotely but objectively via telemedicine
could lead to marked improvements in disease control, quality of life, and overall prognosis. However, current
disease monitoring and management often rely on subjective symptom report, and objective pulmonary
function tests (PFTs) are often only done once or twice a year at subspecialty referral centers. There are very
few solutions to objectively evaluate lung health out of clinic, and existing portable PFTs have several key
limitations: they require additional equipment that is expensive, cumbersome, or needs frequent calibration;
and/or they rely on forced maximal respiratory maneuvers, which require professional coaching and are
particularly difficult for younger children, older adults, and those with advanced disease. Our highly innovative
solution, AWARE (Acoustic WAveform Respiratory Evaluation), aims to fundamentally advance pulmonary
telemedicine by inventing new acoustic sensing and machine learning techniques that transform everyday
smartphones from a video chat client to a fully functional pulmonary telemedicine examination device. We
hypothesize that AWARE can accurately identify specific airway diseases, closely estimate lung function, and
adaptively detect deviations from normal that are associated with disease exacerbations. We will test these
hypotheses by recruiting a cohort of 750 subjects and completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will improve
AWARE’s sensing approach to accurately differentiate participants without chronic airway disease, patients
with asthma, COPD, CF, and other airway diseases. In Aim 2, we will improve AWARE’s accuracy in
estimating lung function indices from spirometry and airway oscillometry, both in healthy participants and in
those with respiratory diseases. In Aim 3, we will develop new techniques to evaluate within-patient changes in
AWARE between stable vs acute exacerbations and provide explainability to the correlation between these
cases by leveraging explainable AI techniques. AWARE will provide an innovative, portable, low-cost, non-
invasive, accurate, reliable, and easy-to-use approach to aid in pulmonary disease diagnosis, lung function
monitoring, and detection of disease exacerbations, providing personalized reports for clinician’s review and
interpretation. Of direct relevance to crises like COVID19, tele-health monitoring with AWARE would reduce
the risk for vulnerable populations by avoiding in-person clinic visits and use of shared PFT equipment."

Sleep is an essential component of children’s development. Disrupted sleep in early life may cause short-term
and lifelong cognitive, behavioral, and metabolic disorders. Prenatal and early-life exposures to neurotoxic
metals have been linked to the sleep disruption in animal models. However, human studies supporting this link
are scarce, evaluated metals individually rather than mixtures as occurs in real-life settings, and characterized
neither the susceptible developmental time windows nor the underlying molecular mechanisms. We will study
how metal exposure during pregnancy and early life affects children’s sleep and sleep disruption during
childhood and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. We will leverage the unique resources of the
PROGRESS birth cohort from Mexico City, known to have a high metal exposure, with biobanked blood
specimens, and objective and longitudinal actigraphy-derived sleep measures at 4–5, 6–7, 8–9, and 10–12 years
of age. In PROGRESS children, we used a breakthrough approach developed by our team to precisely quantify
the time course of metal exposures by measuring metals trapped in teeth layers that recapitulate longitudinal
weekly exposures from the second trimester of pregnancy to the first year after birth, and cumulative exposures
up until teeth shedding in childhood. To assess potential molecular mechanisms, we will build on novel evidence
implicating circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs) in sleep biology. EVs, tiny vesicles secreted by sleep relevant
cells such as the brain, suprachiasmatic nucleus, and circulatory system, are highly sensitive to metal exposures
and are a critical signaling system regulating child sleep and circadian rhythms. EVs transport microRNAs (EV-
miRNA transcriptome) and metabolites (EV-metabolome) that affect the functions of distant recipient cells and
regulate child’s sleep. However, the roles of the EV-miRNA transcriptome and metabolome in metal exposures
and children’s sleep have not been studied. The study will be enabled by a team of excellent investigators with
complementary expertise. In Aim 1, we will determine the impact of metal exposures during pregnancy, infancy
and childhood on children’s sleep and markers of circadian rhythms longitudinally over 12 years, determining
windows of susceptibility and metal mixture effects (N=600). We will then identify circadian rhythm-related EV-
miRNA transcriptome (Aim 2) or neurotransmitter EV-metabolome (Aim 3) profiles measured across two study
visits (4-5 and 6-7 years; N=550) linking metal exposures during pregnancy and early life to children’s sleep
disruption through age 12. In both Aims 2 and 3, we will apply statistical causal modeling and pathway analysis
to characterize pathways linking metal exposures, the EV-miRNA transcriptome/metabolome, and children’s
actigraphy-derived sleep metrics. We will replicate our findings in an US-based cohort (N=100). If successful,
we will discover new, underappreciated environmental causes and mechanisms of sleep disruption that will lead
to stricter metals regulations and the implementation of interventions that help millions of children and prevent
lifelong changes associated with metal-induced sleep abnormalities."

Chemical neurotransmission, an essential component of neuronal communication in the brain, is facilitated by
specialized organelles known as synaptic vesicles. These vesicles mediate the release of neurotransmitters
across synapses. Transporters within the vesicles establish chemical and electrical gradients and load
neurotransmitters into the vesicles, ensuring efficient neurotransmitter release. Defects in these transporters
often associate with neurological diseases, including epilepsy, neurodegeneration, and mental illness. Despite
their importance, many of these transporters remain understudied at a molecular level. One of the most
abundant membrane proteins in synaptic vesicles is synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2), a putative
transporter that is critical for normal synaptic function. Mutations in human SV2 lead to epilepsy and cognitive
impairment, and SV2 is a known target of commonly used antiepileptic medications. However, the precise
function of SV2 and how it mediates synaptic transmission remain largely unknown. Similarly, the mechanism
by which drugs targeting SV2 treat epilepsy is still elusive. We propose an integrated approach that combines
single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, in vivo and in vitro assays, and mass spectrometry to answer critical
questions about SV2: what is its substrate and how is it recognized? What is the nature of the translocation
pathway and how does SV2 transport the substrate? How do antiepileptic drugs regulate SV2? Our research
will significantly advance our understanding of the function and mechanisms of SV2 in synaptic biology, and
provide a strong foundation for developing more effective therapeutic interventions for epilepsy."

Collective cell migration is essential to the progression of normal embryonic development and organogenesis,
and is a tightly-regulated process that can involve the interplay between two or more signaling pathways to
drive forward movement of cell cohorts. Additionally, patterning an organ often requires selective apoptosis
and compensatory proliferation of cells. Errors in collective migration and cell death programs can have serious
consequences, including complete developmental arrest, abnormal organ function, and tumorigenesis. In this
proposed research plan, we will use the Drosophila embryonic caudal visceral mesoderm (CVM), a small
population of muscle precursor cells that undergo highly stereotyped directional movement, as a model for
collective cell migration and survival. As the longest migration of embryogenesis, CVM cells must receive input
via signaling cues from other cells in order to navigate the changing environment of the developing embryo.
We have previously determined an important role for FGF signaling as both chemotropic and survival cue, and
that FGF receptor is specifically expressed in a subset of migratory cells. However, loss of FGF signaling does
not completely ablate collective migration, suggesting the existence of additional, as-of-yet uncharacterized
cues. The objective of this study is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the spatiotemporally-regulated
cues that guide directional movement of the CVM, and subsequent survival or apoptosis of distinct subsets of
cells. Our central hypothesis is that FGF signaling cooperates with additional signaling cues in order to drive
forward movement and cell survival, and involves defining specialized subsets of cells within each CVM cohort
to promote spatial organization driving forward movement. To test this hypothesis, we will pursue the following
specific aims: (AIM 1) Investigate roles for spatially-localized genes within the migrating CVM collective in
promoting cell migration; (AIM 2) Investigate mechanism of CVM attraction to PGCs; and (AIM 3) Investigate
the relationship between BMP and FGF signaling in regulating CVM cell migration and survival. To accomplish
these aims, we will employ an innovative combination of established genetics and immunostaining techniques
with elegant optogenetics and in vivo live imaging approaches to manipulate and visualize migratory cells, as
well as quantify spatiotemporal activation of the cell death program. We believe this study is significant
because it would not only demonstrate a mechanism for signaling cross-talk in an emerging yet
poorly-characterized cell migration system, but considering the large number of functions and diseases
attributed to signaling pathways such as BMP and FGF, elucidating the interaction between multiple pathways
in the context of the genetically-tractable and conserved Drosophila model system has the potential to identify
more specific therapeutic targets. Therefore, this study will be impactful by contributing to a more
comprehensive understanding of collective cell migration, the mechanisms underlying organogenesis, as well
as the cell migration and survival programs implicated in normal development and cancer."

Breathing patterns have strong impacts on emotions in humans. Voluntary control of respiration, especially via
nasal breathing as practiced in yoga and meditation, is effective in reducing anxiety, stress, or even panic
attacks. The effects of breathing patterns on emotions are thought to be related to respiration-entrained brain
rhythms, which have been recognized for decades, but their sources and functions remain elusive. One
potential source of respiration-entrained brain activity is the olfactory system. Nasal airflow activates
intrinsically mechanosensitive olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the nose, which carry the information to the
olfactory bulb (OB) and subsequently to the olfactory cortical regions including the anterior olfactory
nucleus/taenia tecta (AON for simplicity). It is well known that the neural activity along the olfactory pathway is
highly correlated with respiration. Interestingly, recent studies indicate that many non-olfactory cortical and
limbic structures including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) also display nasal airflow-dependent,
respiration-entrained oscillations in both rodents and humans. A potential role of respiration-entrained neural
activity has been examined in the context of learned fear, an emotional state inferred by quantifiable freezing
behavior in rodents. During fear retrieval after tone-foot shock pairing, mice freeze to the conditioned tones
while breathe at a steady rate (~4 Hz), which is correlated with a predominant 4-Hz oscillation in the mPFC, a
region critical for expression of conditioned fear. Disruption of peripheral olfactory inputs significantly reduces
the 4-Hz oscillation in the mPFC and leads to prolonged freezing periods. However, the neural circuits
underlying the effects of olfactory inputs on the mPFC activity and fear-related behaviors remain largely
unresolved. We recently discovered that the mPFC receives direct inputs from the AON, a major target of the
OB tufted cells, which receive stronger peripheral inputs and display robust respiration-entrained activity. The
central hypothesis of this proposal is that the OB tufted cellsAONmPFC pathway is the critical neural
circuit in modulating the mPFC respiration-related rhythm and relevant behaviors. Multidisciplinary approaches
(gene editing, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, circuit tracing, and behavior) will be
combined to pursue three specific aims. We will (1) dissect out this neural pathway in a cell-type specific
manner, (2) determine functional properties of this pathway, and (3) determine behavioral effects of
optogenetic manipulations of this pathway. Overall, the current study will provide critical insights into olfactory
modulation of respiration-entrained brain activity and behavior."
10891507,"Project Summary/Abstract: Cellular membranes can be organized by the formation of discrete
membrane microdomains (MMs), such as the cholesterol- and flotillin-rich “lipid rafts” found in
eukaryotes. In bacteria, little is understood about the spatial organization of the cell membrane.
Because this domain does not synthesize cholesterol or related eukaryotic lipids, it traditionally
has been assumed that they do not contain raft-like compartments. Hopanoid lipids are the
closest bacterial analogs of cholesterol, and my lab has found that they promote formation of
MMs in the facultative endosymbiont Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens. These MMs have similar
biophysical properties as eukaryotic lipid rafts and are typically polarized, suggesting a link
between raft-like MMs and cell polarity. Here, I propose to assess whether hopanoid-mediated
MMs have similar compositions as eukaryotic lipid rafts and identify biological processes that
are coordinated in these regions (Project 1). We also will examine cell cycle and polarity
regulation in B. diazoefficiens, and whether it is affected by hopanoid-mediated MMs in both
free-living and host-associated environments (Project 2). These projects will help discover
fundamental paradigms of bacterial membrane organization that are likely to be shared with
human-associated microbes, and may uncover new parallels between bacterial and eukaryotic
subcellular organization."
10891578,"A health workforce trained to conduct sexual and gender minority (SGM)-inclusive cancer research is needed
for SGM persons seeking comprehensive cancer care, including prevention, screening, treatment, and

number of studies of SGM individuals have documented increased exposure to cancer risk factors and certain
cancers, as well as poorer cancer outcomes. Moreover, SGM groups are highly diverse, presenting with
unique and varied care needs. Although the body of research focused on SGM populations continues to grow,
gaps persist in the knowledge of specific SGM cancer risk factors and cancer treatment experiences critical for
developing evidence-based interventions to optimize oncology care across the cancer care continuum—from
prevention to survivorship. As no nationally available resource routinely trains and prepares the oncology
and biomedical workforce for SGM cancer research, our short-term goal is to establish and promote a
foundational curriculum, SGM Cancer CARE (Sexual and Gender Minority Cancer Curricular Advances
for Research and Education), that recruits and orients early-career and junior investigators to SGM
cancer research and fosters productive collaborations. The curriculum has been designed by a multi-
disciplinary, multi-institutional project team and expert advisory committee that bring national perspective and
experience with SGM populations and in-depth knowledge across key areas, including cancer research,
clinical care, curriculum development, and health care advocacy. Specific Aims: (1) Offer the SGM Cancer
CARE course annually to 30 early-career investigators recruited nationally from a broad audience of
professionals interested in SGM cancer research using a specialized curriculum, multimodal delivery
strategies, networking tools, and innovative teaching methods; (2) Facilitate professional development and
research success for participants by providing orientation and post-workshop seminars to complement the
SGM Cancer CARE course. These sessions will focus on new topics in under-studied areas of SGM cancer
research, as well as provide participants with exposure to potential SGM research mentors and career
development guidance; and (3) maximize the efficacy of the course by evaluating and updating curricular
enhancements and teaching innovations for multimodal dissemination. Core modules include clinical cancer
research, behavioral sciences and interventions, epidemiology and population-level research, community-
based participatory approach for SGM cancer research, data collection and mHealth/eHealth platforms, and
advancing SGM research(ers). This course design will be adaptable for in-person modality, blended learning,
and/or online-only formats in response to the research and education restrictions related to the COVID-19

able to lead and advocate for research to reduce SGM cancer disparities and to advance SGM health equity."
10891580,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Each year, millions of children sustain injuries and undergo invasive medical procedures in the emergency
department (ED). Current guidelines emphasize the need to address the significant pain and distress children
experience in the ED, but inadequate pain and distress management remain prevalent. Under-treated pain and
distress can result in negative future pain experiences and maladaptive psycho-behavioral outcomes. Recent
work suggests that Latinx children are at a particularly high risk for experiencing distress and pain surrounding
surgery as well as pain treatment disparities in the ED. This application proposes a large-scale observational,
longitudinal cohort study to identify both predictors and outcomes of procedural distress and pain in an ethnically
diverse sample of children 2-9 years old undergoing invasive ED procedures. Methods will be based on the
NIMHD Minority Health Disparities Research Framework and Triple Aim and will include empirically informed
assessments of psychological, sociocultural, environmental, healthcare system, clinical recovery, patient
experience, and resource utilization variables. The K23 candidate is an Assistant Professor at the University of
California-Irvine School of Medicine and aims to establish an independent interdisciplinary research program
that improves pediatric pain care and prevents adverse outcomes and healthcare disparities surrounding injury
and painful procedures in the pediatric ED. The candidate’s training plan capitalizes on the expertise of a highly
experienced multidisciplinary mentorship team, integrating key training in pain surrounding invasive ED
procedures, Triple Aim value-based care framework, sociocultural factors in pediatric pain and pediatric
healthcare disparities, advanced statistical modeling, and professional development. This application will be
executed within the UCI Center on Stress & Health, a highly productive, well-established research environment
that incorporates a unique multidisciplinary approach to training and clinical research. The training plan will
incorporate didactic coursework, one-on-one mentoring, and UC Irvine Institute for Clinical and Translational
Science (NIH CTSA) resources and seminars focused on career development, training evaluation and research
ethics. With enthusiastic and material support from the Children’s Hospital of Orange County senior leadership,
the project will be conducted in a high-volume pediatric ED where a large proportion of patients (66%) are Latinx
and are part of an innovative population health program. Collectively, this will provide an exceptional training
environment to characterize multidimensional contributors to procedural pain and distress in a population at-risk
for experiencing care disparities and launch a clinically impactful, independent research program that promotes
effective and equitable pediatric pain and injury-related care in the ED."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Arrestins are an important class of secondary messenger proteins involved in signal transduction at G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) throughout the human body. They underpin cascades associated with nociception,
planning, mood regulation, anxiety, and depression – all higher order functions misregulated in individuals with
addiction disorders. Despite arrestins’ involvement in many clinically important processes, our understanding of
their function on a molecular basis still lags behind the “canonical” secondary messengers at GPCRs, G
proteins. This is due in large part to the complicated regulation and activity of arrestins, which were initially
thought to simply downregulate GPCR signaling through endocytosis. A far more sophisticated view has
evolved in recent years, showing that an interplay between extracellular ligand, receptor, local membrane
environment, and intracellular kinases (GRKs) all play a role in directing arrestin recruitment. Due to the
multicomponent nature of these interactions and their inherently dynamic nature, structural studies revealing
the detailed molecular workings of arrestin signaling regulation have been cumbersome. Recent advances in
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have enabled high resolution structures of some GPCR/arrestin
complexes, but a significant barrier remaining is recapitulating the complex regulation of arrestin recruitment
via GRKs. The spatial and temporal resolution of GRK phosphorylation allows these receptors to fine tune their
selection of arrestin signaling pathway but also creates an incredibly complicated landscape for structural
biologists. This difficulty is lessened if GRKs are not always required for arrestin recruitment, an idea that is
finding traction within the GPCR community. Recent studies have shown that the cannabinoid 2 receptor
(CB2R) can recruit arrestins in GRK knock-down cell lines and that this recruitment is sensitive to mutations in
acidic glutamate and aspartate residues within the receptor C-terminus. Removal of the putative requirement of
GRKs will facilitate NMR techniques uniquely capable of delineating the individual molecular components and
dynamics of the interactions between GPCRs and arrestins. Such techniques will require advanced statistical
treatment which is accessible to me through multiple Northwestern classes. My project seeks to show that
CB2R is a suitable target for this simplification strategy and that this methodology is translational in nature,
allowing similar approaches at other GPCR targets. I hypothesize that there exists a spectrum of GRK
dependence for arrestin recruitment across GPCR phylogeny, enabling a reduction in system complexity for
biochemical study through appropriate receptor selection. An understanding of such interactions may
eventually allow the development of novel pharmaceuticals designed using dynamics-informed structural
approaches."

10931707,"Disruption of Innate Immunity Responses in Monocytes: Contribution to Neurodegeneration
ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), characterized by elevated levels of β-amyloid (Aβ40 and Aβ42), is the leading cause
of dementia, prevailing in approximately 12% of the population worldwide. In turn, HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorders (HAND) prevail in 20-50% of people with HIV (PWH)1,2, despite the access to
combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Monocyte recruitment to the brain promotes macrophage phagocytic
clearance of Aβ plaques and restoration of central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis (reviewed in3).
However, in HIV infection, peripheral monocytes infiltrate the compromised blood brain barrier (BBB) into the
CNS, triggering inflammation and neuronal damage4–7. Interestingly, HAND patients exhibit accumulation of
Aβ in the blood8 and in the brain9–12, despite the presence of infiltrated monocytes. HIV hijacks its target cells
to promote viral replication by impairing the interferon type I (IFN-1) signaling13,14. In AD, altered IFN-1
response decreases the recruitment of monocytes to the CNS15. IFN-1 signaling impairs insulin production16–
18, and dysregulated insulin signaling exacerbates Aβ plaque formation19,20. In turn, elevated levels of Aβ
contribute to insulin resistance and cognitive decline21. In HIV patients on cART, insulin resistance prevalence
is higher, compared to healthy individuals, which in turn is associated with worse neuropsychological
performance, suggesting that metabolic alterations could also contribute to the development of HAND22,23.
Thus, Aβ metabolism, insulin signaling, and cognitive impairment are interconnected. Due to their different
etiologies, the shared mechanisms underlying AD pathology and HIV neuropathogenesis are not well
understood. I hypothesize that impaired IFN-1 signaling in monocyte/macrophage (Mφs) alters their
phenotype and insulin receptor (IR) metabolism, contributing to cognitive impairment in HAND and in AD
patients. In this study, I will determine the contribution of the Mφs IFN-1 response to cognitive decline, through
the following aims: 1) Characterization of IFN-1 signaling and insulin receptor biology in monocytes from the
blood of AD and HAND patients, stratified by cognitive status; 2) using brain organoid models I will determine
whether monocytes are neuroprotective or neuroinflammatory upon HIV infection, using HIV-negative and
positive subjects’ monocytes; 3) I will determine the effect(s) of IFN-1 receptor modulation on Mφs phenotype,
and neuronal dysfunction in vitro using brain organoids. Results from this study will uncover novel mechanisms
involved in the crosstalk between the peripheral and CNS in neurodegenerative disorders. Further, our results
will help identifying candidates and/or targets for the development of effective therapies against cognitive
decline in HAND andAD. The proposed training plan is tailored to capitalize on my expertise in cellular biology
and viral immunology, and to expand my skill set with novel 3D brain organoids methodologies. The
multidisciplinary mentoring team is committed to provide career guidance, enrich my knowledge on new
techniques, and ensure my transition to independence in academia, specializing in neuroimmunology."
10898278,"Project Summary
 Globally, human papilloma virus (HPV) causes 5% of cancers and 30% of head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC). While HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, most infections are cleared
by the innate immune system. Only long-term infections, occurring when the virus evades the innate immune
system, can become cancerous. HPV oncoproteins, specifically E6 and E7, may increase HPV persistence by
disrupting innate immune pathways such as cGAS/STING. The cGAS/STING pathway senses cytosolic double
stranded DNA (dsDNA) and initiates a type I interferon (IFN) response, which can promote immune clearance
of the virus. Upon sensing dsDNA, cGAS combines ATP and GTP to generate cGAMP which activates STING,
ultimately resulting in the production of type I IFNs. Given that IFN has antiviral and antitumor properties, HPV
likely evolved to counteract this pathway. Indeed, there is evidence that HPV oncogenes evade and manipulate
the cGAS/STING pathway. However, HPV may generate several different types of cytosolic DNA; it can induce
genomic DNA damage, may be shuttling viral DNA into the cytosol, and has been correlated to increased
mitochondrial DNA copy number. While these damage associated molecular patterns can activate the
cGAS/STING/IFN pathway, this has not been demonstrated in the case of HPV infection.
 Despite uncertainty as to the source of cGAS/STING pathway activation in HPV(+) cells, pathway
suppression is clearly important. Our preliminary data, working with full-length and recombinant HPV genomes
in primary patient-derived keratinocytes, indicates that HPV infection reduces the activation of the
cGAS/STING/IFN pathway when exposed to exogenous DNA. I demonstrate that HPV E6 expression promotes
STING degradation. In parallel, I demonstrate that, despite interfering with pathway activation, HPV(+) tonsil
cells have increased baseline cGAMP production compared to HPV(-) patient-matched tonsil cells, raising the
question of what is activating cGAS in HPV(+) cells. I hypothesize that HPV causes genomic DNA damage
leading to the production of cGAMP, and to circumvent this, E6 promotes STING degradation.
 To test this hypothesis, I will determine the mechanisms by which high-risk HPV E6 drives STING
degradation as well as identifying the source of nucleic acids causing cGAS activation in HPV(+) cells. Aim 1 of
this proposal will assess the rate of STING degradation, how it is impacted by HPV E6, and the contribution of
two E3 ubiquitin ligases on STING degradation. Aim 2 will identify the source of cGAS-activating nucleic acids
present in HPV(+) tonsil cells and HPV(+) head and neck cancer tumors as well as the contribution of
mitochondrial and genomic DNA damage on cGAS activation. Completion of the proposed studies will provide
greater understanding of how the HPV oncogene E6 impacts STING degradation. It will also identify the source
of nucleic acids activating cGAS in HPV(+) tonsil cells. Additionally, this work will provide me with valuable tools
and training to prepare me for a career in immunology, virology, and cancer research after graduate school."
10900638,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The fundamental mechanisms by which acute intense stress affects energy homeostasis via brain substrates
and sexual dimorphism of these processes are poorly understood. Environmental stressors induce fight-or-
flight-or-freeze response via the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brainstem, a major sympathetic regulator in
humans and animals that triggers energy metabolism. LC innervates the brown adipose tissue (BAT) and
expresses high levels of PAC1 receptor for the neuropeptide PACAP (pituitary adenylate cyclase activating
peptide). PACAP/PAC1 are critical regulators of stressors of all kinds, fear, appetite, feeding, and energy
metabolism and genetically linked to stress-related disorders like post-traumatic stress (PTSD) in humans.
Intriguingly, women with PTSD showing high blood levels of this neuropeptide and brain PAC1 receptors
regulate fear in a sexually dimorphic manner in animals. To test the importance of PAC1 in acute intense
stress and energy homeostasis, we used the stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) behavioral model in mice.
Our preliminary data show that ablation of PAC1 receptors from the LC enhances SEFL expression, energy
metabolism as assessed by indirect calorimetry measurement, and increases metabolic genes like uncoupling
protein 1 in BAT in females than males. Thus, harnessing on the biology of PAC1 receptors, we aim to lay a
mechanistic framework linking acute intense stress and energy metabolism in a systematic and sex-dependent
manner via the LC. We hypothesize that PAC1 receptors in the LC are important for gating stress-associated
metabolic information and BAT functions in a sexually dimorphic manner. Aim 1 will test a SEFL mediated loss
of function of LC-PAC1 on whole body energy expenditure and on BAT functions. For this, we will test if viral
cre-recombinase mediated PAC1 deletion from LC in mice with floxed PAC1 regulates SEFL-associated
energy expenditure and induction of thermogenic genes in BAT in a sex-dependent manner (via transcript
analysis, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and tissue lipolysis). Aim 2 will test if PAC1 expressing LC neurons
project directly to BAT in a sexually dimorphic manner under SEFL. For this, we will use retrograde viral tracing
to determine LC to BAT projecting cell populations combined with in situ hybridization for PAC1 in LC. We
predict that female mice will show enhanced energy expenditure, BAT thermogenesis and increased LC
projection to BAT. Overall, using state-of-the-art tools and techniques and rigorous systems biology approach
of linking acute intense stress and energy metabolism, our studies will lay crucial groundwork for several future
work. This will serve as a premise for studying central sympathetic control of metabolism in chronic stress-
related conditions such as PTSD that are comorbid with metabolic diseases and increasingly prevalent in the
US populations."

Education is among the most important determinants of later-life cognitive functioning and biological markers of
AD/ADRD risk. However, we know very little about how, why, or for whom education matters for these cognitive
outcomes. This makes it difficult to design effective early life preventative interventions. To know how and why
education matters for later-life cognitive functioning and biological markers of AD/ADRD risk, we need high
quality prospective studies that follow diverse young people through schools and across adulthood; that measure
key and modifiable educational contexts, opportunities, and outcomes; that observe midlife socioeconomic
attainments; and that assess cognitive functioning and biological markers of AD/ADRD risk in late life. To date,
no such studies exist.
This project brings together an established and interdisciplinary team of neurologists, neuropsychologists,
sociologists, education scientists, survey methodologists, biostatisticians, and neuroimaging experts who will re-
contact surviving members the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 (NLS-72;
N=14,489). NLS-72 is a nationally representative and highly diverse random sample of Americans first
interviewed as high school seniors in 1972. Following protocols developed and successfully deployed in the High
School and Beyond (HSB) cohort in 2014-2015 and 2021, the team will conduct in-home interviews that include
extensive cognitive assessments and anthropometric measures; in-home visits to gather whole blood; and (for
500 people near one of five regional centers) neuroimaging via harmonized magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The resulting data—which will be securely released to the wider scientific community during the project period—
will be used to conduct transformative analyses of the effects of educational contexts, opportunities, and
outcomes on risk of AD/ADRD as observed in cognitive assessments, blood-based markers of neuropathology,
and neuroimaging. The project has four aims: (Aim 1) To estimate the extent to which education shapes
biological, neurocognitive, and behavioral markers of AD/ADRD risk at age 70; (Aim 2) To estimate the extent to
which adult socioeconomic attainments mediate the effects of education on vascular health, pace of biological
aging, and cognitive functioning at age 70; (Aim 3) To estimate the extent to which racial and ethnic differences
in the quality of and returns to education account for disparities in markers of AD/ADRD risk; and (Aim 4) To
securely disseminate newly collected NLS-72 data for wide use by the research community. The analyses made
possible by the newly collected data will transform our understanding of how and why education and other early
life factors impact AD/ADRD risk and resilience."

negative Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli, S. typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) are of “critical priority”. These
pathogens are the focus of the present proposal aimed at developing a platform for efficient
discovery of novel antimicrobials. The field once enjoyed a golden era of discovery, fueled
mainly by screening of soil actinomycetes. All major classes of broad-spectrum antibiotics active
against Gram-negative pathogens were discovered by the 1960s. Overmining of actinomycetes
resulted in the collapse of the discovery platform. Novel antibiotics discovered since then only
act against Gram-positive species. We developed methods to access a broader range of
bacteria, with a focus on uncultured species that make up 99% of total biodiversity. A number of
novel compounds came from this source, including teixobactin, representing a new class of cell-
wall acting compounds without detectable resistance (Ling et al., 2015). Teixobactin is
undergoing IND-enabling studies; it is also a narrow-spectrum compound. We propose to
develop a platform for efficient discovery of novel antimicrobials. The main problem is the
enormous background of toxic, and to a lesser extent, known compounds. We hypothesize that
the bottleneck of dereplication can be resolved by differential screening that detects the
presence of a promising compound prior to dereplication. Using this approach, we recently
discovered darobactins that have a novel scaffold and target the essential outer membrane
protein BamA (Imai et al., 2019), and several additional novel compounds. In the proposed
project, we will develop an ultra-high throughput screen based on encapsulating producing
bacteria together with different fluorescently labeled reporters in microdroplets created in a
microfluidics device. Our preliminary data show that sorting droplets can be performed at a rate
of 106 a day, and leads to detection of producers of desirable antimicrobials. We will evaluate
several modalities of this screen, aimed at discovering selective as well as broad-spectrum
compounds acting against Gram-negative bacteria; and anti-persister compounds. The platform
is likely to be of use to the field of antibiotic discovery. Leads that come out of this screen will be
evaluated in vitro and in animal models of infection. Novel leads that come out of this project will
be ready to enter IND-enabling studies."

to interrupt or reverse the impact of these HCC-causing infections. We will accomplish this objective by
developing local capacity and performing important research. The H2A Scholar Award provides synergistic
funding to early-stage African investigators for both individual career development activities and a mentored

between Uganda and Senegal and opportunities to link across countries and with Hopkins will actively be

and immunological responses in the periphery and the liver in response to Sm treatment with praziquantel.
Over time, liver Sm-related inflammation transitions from a Th1 to Th2 bias, and we hypothesize this transition
may promote HBV replication. We will evaluate the dynamics of plasma HBV DNA during Sm treatment and
correlate these with contemporaneous changes in plasma cytokines to characterize Th1 shifted inflammation.
We also concurrently examine HBV specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, and measures of Sm treatment
efficacy. Through investigation of liver biopsies on patients before and after SM treatment as well as with HCC,
we anticipate confirming in humans that Sm is pro-carcinogenic and that Sm treatment only partially diminishes
expression of pro-carcinogenic genes. HIV will be evaluated as a modifier of each relationship. Given our

Stroke and cardiovascular disease account for 1 in 4 deaths among Latinos in the U.S, and heart disease is

hypertension. Primordial prevention of hypertension is critical in moving forward in terms of the achievement of
ideal cardiovascular health cardiovascular health for all. There is growing evidence that integrating families and

Over the course of life, chronic stressors contribute to multi-organ aging and dysfunction and, ultimately, the
development of clinical disease. Sex remains a critical determinant of the nature and pace of aging and ultimately
longevity. Among mammalian species, it is even more clear that females fundamentally age differently from
males. With advancing chronologic age in humans, differences in biological aging between women and men
become even more pronounced, culminating in the female predominance for a number of important morbid
disease conditions, including notably Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), and in turn systemic frailty.
Mechanisms underlying the female predominance for these major morbidities remains unknown and are not
explained by variations in sex hormones or survival bias. Our preliminary work supports a central hypothesis that
sexual dimorphism in inflammatory eicosanoid mediators contribute to sex differences in microvascular
dysfunction and, in turn, to sex differences in age-related multi-organ disease, including for ADRD, HFpEF and
CKD. Elucidating a common pathophysiologic basis for the female predominance of ADRD, HFpEF, and CKD
holds the key to effective interventions for reducing the excess burden of age-related disease in women.

major age-related disease outcomes, we propose to establish the Microvascular Aging and Eicosanoids –

10900239,"Abstract
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) differ in many of
the genetic drivers, low responsiveness to immunotherapy remains a commonality shared between both.
Resistance to therapy remains an issue and while the field awaits results from numerous ongoing clinical trials,
the mechanistic underpinnings that contribute to response vs. progression remain poorly understood. Our lab
has shown that radiation therapy (RT) and PD1-IL2v, an immunocytokine that selectively delivers IL2 to PD-1
expressing cells via the intermediate affinity IL-2Rβγ, promotes increased infiltration, activation, and cytotoxicity
of CD8 T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in preclinical orthotopic models of HNSCC and PDAC. Although the
effect is substantial and results in significant tumor regression and abrogation of metastasis, the effect is
transient, and tumors reoccur in the majority of mice. We therefore sought to investigate additional
immunotherapies that can be added to further sustain the anti-tumor immune response induced by RT + PD1-
IL2v. OX40 is a secondary costimulatory receptor which is expressed on activated T cells and provides survival
signals which are critical to maintain long term immune responses. OX40 agonism has been shown to synergize
well with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), effectively boosting anti-tumor immunity in multiple tumor models.
OX40 therefore represented a suitable candidate for combinatorial therapy along with PD1-IL2v and RT. Upon
the addition of αOX40, we observed a striking dichotomy in the responses between preclinical models of HNSCC
and PDAC. αOX40 promotes further efficacy of RT + PD1-IL2v and drives tumor eradication in HNSCC, whereas
survival is significantly decreased in PDAC compared to RT + PD1-IL2v. Regulatory T cells (Tregs), have been
established as critical mediators of response in both HNSCC and PDAC, and interestingly, the depletion of Tregs
re-establishes to therapy. Delving deeper into this disparity, we observed that PDAC tumor microenvironment
(TME) have an increased abundance of the cytokine IL-33 and is enriched with Tregs expressing the IL-33
receptor ST2, a distinctly suppressive subset which is associated with tumor progression. We therefore
hypothesize that OX40 agonism drives accelerated tumor progression in PDAC by preferentially activating ST2
expressing Tregs in the PDAC TME. Aim 1 will focus on the effect that deletion of OX40 from Tregs has on
therapeutic outcomes in the context of RT + PD1-IL2v + αOX40. In Aim 2, we will explore the tumor and TME
intrinsic factors that can influence the dichotomous response to our combined radio-immunotherapy. We expect
that this proposal will provide a mechanistic understanding of the parameters that determine response vs.
progression."
10900177,"Project Summary
 Chronic inflammation is highly prevalent and has deleterious effects on brain health, including links to brain
structural abnormalities1, neural metabolic changes2, psychiatric disorders2, cognitive dysfunction3, and aging-
related diseases4,5. Given the increasing prevalence of chronic inflammatory diseases6–9, a better understanding
of interventions that may reduce the impacts of inflammation on brain health is imperative10. A growing body of
literature demonstrates positive impacts of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) on mental and physical
health11–15, brain structure and function14,16–19, and chronic inflammation20. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory
disease that is uniquely well-suited to examine the protective effects of MBIs across multiple dimensions of health
because it is sensitive to changes in stress21–23, highly prevalent and comorbid with depression24,25, and has been
associated with compromises in brain structure26–28 and function29,30. The first aim of this proposal is to 1) assess
changes in brain health indices in individuals with asthma from pre- to post- 8-week Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention and at 3-month follow-up (n=46). I will utilize a novel, whole-brain voxel-
wise assessment of DWI, modeled using diffusion tensor (DTI) and neurite orientation dispersion and density
imaging (NODDI), which provides meaningful, clinically relevant tissue parameters of white and grey matter
microstructure and will enable detection of changes at a high spatial resolution. Additionally, I will examine changes
in biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in concert with DTI and NODDI metrics, a novel
approach which will strengthen our confidence in the underlying meaning of changes in DWI metrics. The second
aim of this proposal is to 2) assess the association of these brain health indices with indices of whole-person
health and wellbeing, from pre- to post- 8-week MBSR intervention and at 3-month follow-up (n=46). While
previous work has reported structural and functional brain changes related to MBIs, a deeper understanding of
how these changes are related to other aspects of whole-person health is needed. High stress and poor sleep are
drivers of systemic inflammation31 and brain microstructural deterioration32–35, and their improvement may link MBIs
to salubrious outcomes. Sleep quality, life stress, and self-reported wellbeing will serve as indices of a psychological
dimension of whole-person health, and asthma severity and airway inflammation will serve as indices of a disease-
specific dimension of whole-person health, contributing to our understanding of how changes in brain health after
MBI relate to experiential outcomes. The impact of a behavioral intervention on the interrelations of brain- and
whole-person health indices in asthma has not previously been investigated and represents a potential for
substantial public health impact given the growing evidence of the effects of asthma on the brain and the growing
prevalence of asthma. Finally, this training fellowship will facilitate valuable training opportunities in DWI analysis,
statistical methods, psychoneuroimmunology and contemplative neuroscience education, experimental design and
data collection, writing, public-speaking, mentorship, and ethics."
10903726,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart disease and its treatments, including hospitalization, surgery, and procedures, can result in devastating
loss of function, particularly in inactive older adults, who often face a prolonged recovery. Maximizing fitness
and promoting adequate physical activity (PA) are critical targets for healthy aging and recovery after a cardiac
event. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) provides up to 36 supervised exercise training sessions and lifestyle
counseling to these patients and is thus ideally positioned to promote full recovery, encourage regular PA,
optimize cardiac health, and support more successful aging for these patients. However, many CR programs
fail to meet established benchmarks for improving fitness among their patients. This failure is likely attributable
to marked differences in exercise intensity prescription practices across CR programs, which have recently
been identified.
 Specifically, the most common method for prescribing exercise intensity in CR is the use of ratings of
perceived exertion (RPE) coupled with a “rule of thumb” approach to achieve an exercise training heart rate
(HR) that is 20-30 bpm higher than resting HR. While easy to implement, these usual care (UC) techniques
often result in a self-selected and suboptimal exercise intensity. This, in turn, leads to lower gains in fitness and
failure to reach established benchmarks. Instead, societal guidelines recommend patients undergo a graded
exercise test (GXT) to measure a peak exercise HR and be prescribed exercise intensity using a computed
target heart rate range (THRR). This approach (GXT-THRR) allows tailoring of exercise based on the
individual patient’s response to acute exercise. However, no studies to date have tested the efficacy of GXT-
THRR compared to UC, and this critical knowledge gap is likely responsible for the marked differences in
exercise intensity prescription techniques across programs. Our preliminary data suggest GXT-THRR will lead
to greater gains in fitness in CR, boost self-efficacy, reduce fear of exercise, and improve outcomes.
 To address this fundamental question, we will perform a 320-person randomized trial comparing GXT-
THRR to UC among older adults with heart disease attending CR. In Aim 1, we will measure improvements in
fitness during CR. In Aim 2, we will assess the impact of GXT-THRR on psychological factors associated with
exercise adherence (self-efficacy and fear). In Aim 3, we will evaluate how the use of GXT-THRR impacts
long-term PA, quality of life, fitness, and clinical outcomes.
 Our multi-disciplinary team has broad experience in all aspects of this proposal, including exercise
physiology, CR, cardiology, geriatrics, and psychology. Our approach is informed by a successful pilot trial
which demonstrated the clear feasibility and potential effectiveness of GXT-THRR. Ultimately, we anticipate
our results will promote evidence-based exercise intensity practices in CR programs, leading to greater
improvements in fitness, PA, and exercise self-efficacy, and more successful aging."

Exposure of Carbofuran (CF; a pesticide) and Chlorine (Cl2; a bleaching and warfare agent) to humans is a major
public health issue. Over 3 million people exposed to CF/Cl2 show high ocular morbidity. A major gap in
knowledge is lack of mechanistic data “how CF/Cl2 exposure causes corneal injury and vision loss”? We test a
novel hypothesis that mTORC1-mediated dysfunctional autophagosome formation and lysosomal biogenesis
are a dominant operating mechanism for corneal damage from exposure of these threat chemicals (CF/Cl2).
Autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis play a key role in corneal homeostasis and transparency maintenance.
Our hypothesis is based on a human-patient study identifying defective autophagy the cause of slow and
progressive corneal thinning and vision loss in keratoconus patients. Pilot studies performed with mice and donor
human corneas strongly supports our novel hypothesis. The main goal of this project is to test our hypothesis
employing highly rigorous approach using 2 threat chemicals (CF and Cl2) and 2 animal species (C57BL/6J mice
and New Zealand White rabbits) and applicability of postulated mechanism in human using donor human cornea
derived organ culture and primary cell culture models using two entirely independent but integrated specific aims.
Aim-1 defines clinical signs and underline mechanism of late/chronic corneal toxicity caused by CF exposure to
the eye using 3 sub-aims: (1a) records clinical signs and changes in the phenotype and density of corneal
epithelial, stromal keratocytes, and endothelial cells in CF +/- exposed eyes of live rabbits and mice in vivo every
two weeks interval with slit-lamp, HRT3-RCM confocal, Specular, and Spectralis optical coherence tomography
microscopy system until 6 months, (1b) defines the mechanism by analyzing autophagosomal and lysosomal
signature genes (ATGs, LC3, SQSTM1/p62, LAMP1, mTORC1, TFEB, & vATPase) in CF +/- exposed corneas
of 2 species collected at 1, 2, 4, and 6 months, and (1c) verifies applicability of postulated mechanism in human
using cadaver corneas. Aim-2 defines clinical symptoms and underline mechanism of late/chronic corneal
toxicity caused by Cl2 exposure to the eye using 3 sub-aims: (2a) records clinical signs and changes in the
phenotype and density of corneal epithelial, stromal keratocytes, and endothelial cells in Cl2 +/- eyes of live
rabbits and mice in vivo, (2b) elucidates Cl2-induced corneal damage by studying autophagosomal and
lysosomal signatures stated in aim-1b in Cl2 +/- corneas of 2 species, and (2c) verifies applicability of mechanism
in humans using control donor human corneas employing an experimental approach and techniques stated in
Aim-1a-c. With proposed studies, we expect to define start time, extent, and duration of symptoms after CF and
Cl2 exposure in live animals, role of mTORC1 mediated autophagic events in CF/Cl2 exposed corneas and
signature autophagosomal and lysosomal genes linked to CF/Cl2 mediated corneal toxicity. Successful
completion of studies is expected to fill many knowledge gaps and advance ocular counterACT field significantly."

treatment for T1DM but its use is critically limited by a shortage of human donor pancreata. Pigs are a potential
source of donor organs, and pig-to-human islet xenotransplantation could provide a scalable therapy for T1DM
if xeno-islet rejection could be reliably and tolerably controlled. Xenotransplant rejection can be mitigated by
recipient immune suppression and the burden of immunosuppression required to prevent rejection can be
reduced through donor genetic modification of the islets used for transplantation. In the current funding period
(U01AI090956), we have made substantial progress, exploiting both of these approaches to establish a xeno-
islet transplant model using neonatal porcine islets (NPIs) transplanted to diabetic rhesus monkeys and have
demonstrated that NPIs can provide extended islet function in primates. We have further developed a tolerable
immune management regimen that uses clinically available immunosuppressants, and a novel method, the dual
islet transplant model (DITM), to validate donor islet alterations that improve islet resilience, engraftment and
survival. These studies have provided important mechanistic insights into xeno-islet rejection, particularly
related to targetable B cell and Th17 cell functions. We have also advanced a novel islet modification, X-linked
inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) over-expression, that reduces islet apoptosis and improves islet resiliency to T cell–
mediated attack in vitro. Through other study, we have identified a donor cell therapy, ethylcarbodiimide treated
splenocyte (ECDI-SP) infusion, which in mice lessens the need for immunosuppression. In this current
competitive renewal application, we propose three specific aims that will: 1) optimize our accessible
immunosuppressive regimen, guided by our recent insights, to control B cell and Th17 contributions to xenograft
rejection; 2) translate our recent insights regarding ECDI-SP infusion from murine models into our pig-to-primate
model, investigating the potential for this therapy to reduce the burden of immunosuppression; and 3) examine
islet modifications in the DITM, using rationally considered transgenic pigs from industry collaborators and
specifically examining the role of XIAP in islet cell survival in vivo. Our experienced and productive team is
bolstered by two new collaborators, Dr. Xunrong Luo, an expert in islet transplantation and immunomodulation,
who joins as co-PI with Dr. Kirk, and eGenesis, a group rapidly advancing the genetic modification of pigs through
CRISPR methodologies. Our ultimate goal is to identify an ideal donor islet source and a clinically tolerable
immunosuppressive regimen to advance porcine islet xenotransplantation for T1DM into clinical reality."

Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been tested in nearly one thousand clinical trials, mostly because of
their ability to secrete factors that can modify host environments. For instance, MSCs can adapt to their niches
and remodel the extracellular matrix. While this property of MSCs can potentially be beneficial to treat fibrosis
and promote tissue regeneration, leveraging this property has been challenging because specific signals that
enable MSCs to remodel the matrix remain to be defined and leveraged in MSC-based therapeutics. Here, we
describe a highly efficient approach to encapsulate individual cells in engineered gel coatings with specifically
defined biophysical and biochemical cues. We have developed this approach to show that soft, thin gel coating
is an enabling cue that increases the production of soluble interstitial collagenases in response to tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Importantly, our preliminary data show that gel-coated MSCs decrease collagen
deposition in a murine muscular dystrophy model. In this K99/R00 proposal, I will build upon these results to
test the hypothesis that programming of MSCs using specifically engineered microgels activates the potential
of MSCs to inhibit muscle fibrosis. In Aim 1, we will determine the role of engineered gel coating in TNFα-
induced activation of MSCs to produce high levels of interstitial collagenases and degrade collagen, and
understand mechanisms behind this process. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of gel-coated MSCs in
inhibiting muscle fibrosis and restoring muscle functions. Success of this proposal will lead to an effective
strategy to treat muscle fibrosis, which is a major unmet clinical need. During the K99 phase, I will work with
my advisory committee to enhance my knowledge in biomaterial design, cellular mechanobiology,
pathophysiology of fibrosis, as well as advanced microtechnologies, imaging, and computational approaches to
effectively drive this research project. These experiences together with career development activities described
in this proposal will ensure my smooth transition to an independent investigator at the interface between
mechanobiology and bioengineering to develop novel therapeutic strategies for muscle disorders."

Prognosis for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remains poor due to high rates of metastatic disease,
vast intra-tumoral heterogeneity, limited therapeutic options, and rapid development of therapeutic resistance.
Our lab has recently shown that Abelson (ABL) family kinase inhibitors are effective in the treatment of SCLC
metastases in vivo. Targeted combination therapies can minimize cytotoxic adverse events and impair the
development of resistance. Thus, we performed a whole-genome CRISPR/Cas9 loss-of-function sensitization
screen to identify synergizing combination therapy targets with the ABL allosteric inhibitor ABL001. Consistent
with prior observations that ABL kinase inhibition dysregulates mitochondrial and metabolic function in lung
adenocarcinoma, numerous top sensitizers to ABL kinase inhibition revealed by the screen are involved in the
processing and clearance of metabolic products. Preliminary validation of the screen has shown that inhibition
of organic anion MCT transporters synergizes with ABL001 to cause cell death as a consequence of a
mitochondrial dysregulation phenotype observed in lung cancer cells following treatment with allosteric ABL
kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, targeted metabolomic sequencing revealed that following combination treatment
with ABL and MCT inhibitors, the levels of numerous metabolite species become significantly dysregulated.
These changes are consistent with the stalling of glutaminolysis and are most strikingly characterized by a
significant decrease in glutathione, an important mediator of metabolic stress responses. My hypothesis is that
the metabolic stress induced by inhibition of the ABL kinases when paired with MCT inhibition, results in the
stalling of glutaminolysis and the subsequent loss of glutathione, thereby promoting ferroptosis, and contributing
to the synergistic cell death phenotype observed. The aims of this proposal are 1) to determine how the ABL
kinases mediate homeostatic metabolic function and define the mechanism of metabolic dysregulation following
ABL kinase inhibition, 2) to determine the mechanism of dysregulation of glutaminolysis following combined ABL
kinase and MCT inhibition, and 3) assess the extent to which this combined therapy contributes to cell death via
ferroptosis. Approaches to address these objectives include metabolic profiling via stable isotope tracing of
glucose and glutamine, and Seahorse assays to measure oxidative and glycolytic energy metabolism. We will
also assess the extent to which this combination treatment induces ferroptotic cell death by in vitro drug-
treatment and isogenic knockout experiments. Subsequently we will perform in vivo drug treatment experiments
to assess the efficacy of combined ABL and MCT inhibition in the treatment of SCLC in mouse models. This
investigation into the role of the ABL kinases in metabolic dynamics will explore a novel mechanism of regulation
of mitochondrial homeostasis by the ABL kinases, as well as evaluate a potential treatment modality for patients
with SCLC."
10900297,"Summary
Lung diseases, such as interstitial lung diseases, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and acute viral infection, are major leading causes of death worldwide.
There is a pressing unmet medical need to develop noninvasive imaging methodologies and contrast agents to
detect early stages of lung fibrosis, and to stage fibrosis severity and heterogeneous expression of collagen.
MRI is potentially the best imaging modality for early detection and monitoring of lung disease progression and
regression8-10 due to its advantage of not using harmful ionizing radiation, which reduces safety concerns for
increased accessibility to patient populations, including children and pregnant women, and its superior ability to
longitudinally characterize tissue properties. However, lung imaging by MRI, especially in small animals,
encounters many unique difficulties11-13 including respiratory cardiac motion, the relatively low tissue density, and
short relaxation times. A collagen-targeted MRI contrast agent overcoming these challenges will address the
critical unmet medical need for lung fibrosis imaging. Dr. Yang (PI) at Georgia State University has pioneered a
novel class of protein-based MRI contrast agents (ProCAs) targeting molecular biomarkers. ProCA32.collagenL
specifically targets collagen and is tailored to lung imaging, exhibiting strong specificity to overexpressed collagen in
patient lung fibrosis tissues with high translational potential. The goal of this R61/R33 Catalyze application is to
create stable and homogeneous ProCA32.collagenL for monitoring lung fibrosis progression by
ProCA32.collagenL enabled precision MRI. In R61 phase, we will develop homogenous collagen-targeted protein
MRI contrast agents for precision Imaging of lung fibrosis. Various biophysical methods will be performed to
ensure homogenous and strong stability of formulated Gd-ProCA32.collagenL complex. Our Go / No-Go
milestones is to identify stable Gd-ProCA32.collagenL with desired homogeneity. In R33 Phase, we first aim to
evaluate in vivo imaging capability of lung fibrosis for early detection using multiple mouse models. Quantitative
mapping of fibrosis remodeling using established radio-histological methodology. We then aim to evaluate pMRI’s
ability to monitor drug treatment response in vivo. We will define histopathologic and radiologic signatures of lung
fibrosis and their treatment changes and improve sensitivity using machine learning AI methodology. Our
transformative product will open a new avenue for non-invasive longitudinal early diagnosis and monitoring of
lung fibrosis treatment with disease activity by pMRI without radiation."

Communication deficits are the most common disabilities in children, affecting 11% of
preschoolers. Although the causes of communication deficits vary, the underlying
pathological mechanisms are believed to converge at the level of neural circuitry
dysfunction. The focus of this project is to identify deficits in neural function specializations
for vocalization processing in a mouse model of Rett Syndrome (MeCP2 loss), a form of
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A core deficiency in ASD is language impairment, which
is accompanied by atypical brain lateralization of language processing. This change in a
fundamental feature of speech perception disrupts the division of labor between the left
and right auditory cortices that is crucial to rapidly parse and decode fleeting vocalizations.
The mouse is a relevant species in which to study communication disorders based on the
similarities between the murine and human vocalization processing systems. The long-term goal of this laboratory is to develop an efficient pipeline to link ASD risk genes with
functional communication deficits, targeting molecular pathways and critical
developmental time points for therapeutic intervention. The objective of this proposal is to
determine how MeCP2 loss translates into deficits in hemispheric specializations for
vocalization processing that are shared between humans and mice. Aim 1 will identify
deficits in lateralized function (in vivo), aim 2 will identify abnormalities in the local
connectivity of excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations (in vitro), and Aim 3 will
examine interhemispheric communication dysfunction. Disruptions in the timing of critical
periods are a well-established consequence of MeCP2 loss. Therefore, we predict that
this deficit prevents the normal development of lateralized auditory specializations, leading
to a loss of the neurotypical hemispheric division of labor that is critical for processing
social communication. This approach is innovative because we are the first group to
identify lateralized circuit and functional features in auditory cortex, and we can leverage
this knowledge to identify abnormalities in hemispheric specializations of vocalization
processing. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to reveal
fundamental insights into how hemispheric specializations relevant to vocal
communication go awry in a mouse model of ASD."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of death nationwide, with 65% of mortality due to cardiovascular
disease. The term “diabetic cardiomyopathy (T2DCM)” refers to a condition with adverse myocardial remodeling
in the absence of hypertension and vascular pathology. Although T2D and CVD are tightly intertwined, we lack
a deeper understanding of T2DCM at the molecular and cellular levels. Pathological mechanisms within the
primary constituents of the heart – cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells – are incompletely
understood. Furthermore, how these metabolic signals converge within the cardiac microenvironment remains
elusive. First developed to treat T2D, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) prevent glucose
reabsorption by the kidney. However, recent clinical trials of SGLT2i (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and
empagliflozin) further demonstrated an unexpected and substantial reduction in heart failure hospitalizations in
patients with and without T2D. Since SGLT2 is lowly expressed in the heart, its off-target mechanisms present a
fascinating opportunity to elucidate cardiac protective targets beyond glycemic control. I hypothesize that
metabolic interplay between cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts play a role in T2DCM
pathogenesis, and SGLT2 inhibition is a tool to dissect cell-specific protective mechanisms. Since access to
human cardiac samples is limited by primary culture or post-mortem autopsy, the pre-clinical testing of
cardiovascular drugs difficult. Thus, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become a valuable platform for
biomedical research by providing tissue-specific human cells that retain patients' genetic integrity and display
disease phenotypes in a dish. In this F32 proposal, I will harness iPSC technology to generate T2DCM models
of cardiovascular cell types for cellular and metabolic phenotyping with and without SGLT2 inhibition (Aim 1).
The iPSCs of T2D patients (10 healthy, 20 T2D) are readily available from the Stanford Cardiovascular Institute
Biobank. They will be differentiated into three cardiovascular cell types using robust protocols followed by
contractility, mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, cellular (viability, migration, proliferation), and metabolic
function (13C-metabolomics) measurements. Next, I will construct iPSC-derived engineered heart tissues for
functional phenotyping of cellular interplay (Aim 2). I will further determine the SGLT2i-protein interactome using
limited proteolysis coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS). Using a systems-level
approach compatible with complex biological samples will enable elucidation of drug-protein interactions relevant
to T2DCM with peptide-level resolution. In summary, this research plan presents a novel, comprehensive view
of metabolic mechanisms conferred by T2DCM pathogenesis, and SGLT2 inhibition and can be used as a
springboard for discovering new cardiac protective agents. Taken together, this project will bolster an innovative
direction for the cardiovascular community while providing me with the necessary training to become an
independent researcher of cardiac metabolic disease."

10900963,"Akkermansia muciniphila is a commensal gut microbe that has been implicated in a multitude of human health
conditions. A. muciniphila lives deeply embedded within the mucin layer, where it survives by consuming mucin
as a source of carbon and nitrogen. This microbe has been shown to influence host cellular activity as well as
protect against gut inflammation, obesity, and metabolic disorders such as diabetes. First isolated in an effort
to discover mucin-degrading bacteria, this microbe has also been thought of as a potential probiotic. However,
despite nearly two decades of study, the biological mechanisms by which it metabolizes mucin are unknown.
Specialized metabolic machinery is required to degrade mammalian gastrointestinal mucin due to its complex
structure. Recently, our lab has discovered several unique aspects of mucin metabolism that this proposal
seeks to study further. Firstly, we have shown that A. muciniphila can accumulate mucin intracellularly, and this
process is specific to mucin. Furthermore, we have pioneered a means to perform transposon (Tn)
mutagenesis in A. muciniphila as well as subsequent high-throughput INSeq studies to assay the genetic
determinants mucin utilization. These have shown that mucin metabolism occurs in several discrete steps: the
binding to mucin extracellularly; its import into the cell through dedicated mucin transporters; and its
subsequent degradation and metabolism intracellularly. I propose to identify genes required for mucin
accumulation, as well as expand the knowledge of the glycoside hydrolases and mucin-binding proteins
produced by A. muciniphila. While studies seem to suggest that this microbe has numerous health benefits, the
knowledge of how A. muciniphila interacts with human host cells is predicated upon a deeper understanding of
the fundamental biology and the mechanisms that enable it to thrive within the gastrointestinal mucin layer."

Around 80 million US adults will have arthritis by 2040, which causes a significant societal problem resulting
in an annual healthcare cost of > $136.8 billion. These progressive degenerative diseases result in long-term
functional disabilities and morbidities leading to activity limitations and productivity loss. Joint instability
typically precedes before the symptom onset, but it is typically not detectable in standard imaging exams.
Patients can therefore suffer for years, as symptoms worsen before an accurate diagnosis is made. There is a
critical need for an accurate imaging technique for early diagnosis, which is crucial to providing the most
effective medications, therapies, and surgical interventions and restoring joint function before the onset of
disabling symptoms.
Various limitations have hindered the accurate detection of joint instability in standard imaging exams:
radiography and fluoroscopy cannot visualize 3-dimensional (3D) joint anatomy; ultrasound lacks
visualization of bone structure; static MRI/CT cannot assess the effect of dynamic structural and
biomechanical pathologies. Accurate diagnosis is therefore oftentimes acquired using invasive arthroscopy,
which exposes patients to risks of the associated complications. Although there have been some recent
advancements in 4D (3D + time) CT to provide dynamic imaging capability, its clinical use is limited due to
(1) joint motion artifacts that affect accurate anatomical and functional analyses, and (2) poor soft-tissue
visualization that prohibits robust assessment of connective tissue involvement.
The specific goal of this application is to develop and validate a new diagnostic imaging technique – 6DCT (3D
+ time + spectral information + kinematics) in combination with custom deep-learning methods. The 6DCT will
provide an accurate, informative, one-stop-shop diagnostic tool to assess early dynamic joint pathologies
before the onset of arthritis, which will obviate the need for invasive tests and procedures, with improved
patient care and associated cost savings. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims:
1. Develop a robust motion correction technique for dynamic joint imaging.
2. Develop a spectral post-processing technique for characterizing connective tissue involvement.
3. Demonstrate the feasibility of 6DCT in imaging dynamic joint pathology.
This work is the first to develop innovative 6DCT as a robust dynamic imaging tool for both bone and connective
tissues, and to provide new anatomical and functional information to facilitate assessing dynamic joint pathologies.
These capabilities have clinical significance as they will enable early diagnosis of joint instability, which will
subsequently enable early interventions that will improve patient health. This proposal will develop the
essential techniques and preliminary data for future large cohort prospective patient studies."

NIH supported research aims to advance our understanding of biological systems, improve the control of
disease, and enhance health. Despite the well-recognized importance of connecting researchers working at
the forefront of fundamental cell biology with those studying the pathogenesis and eventual treatment of
disease, conferences that bridge these approaches are remarkably scant. The 2024 Gordon Research
Conference on Lysosomes and Endocytosis will be particularly impactful in this area, with a theme of
“Mechanisms, Molecules and Therapeutic Opportunities across the Endolysosomal System” and a distinctive
focus on neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related
Dementias (AD/ADRD). This conference will facilitate interaction and collaboration between cell biologists,
neuroscientists, geneticists, neurologists, and others in related biomedical fields and at different stages of their
career. By bringing together the leading experts working to understand normal and pathologic function across
the endolysosomal system, the Lysosomes and Endocytosis GRC/GRS will be a unique opportunity to
disseminate knowledge, foster interdisciplinary interactions and learning, and provide outstanding networking
and mentorship opportunities. The GRC is preceded by the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), a unique forum
for trainees and early career scientists to present and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas. The goals of
the Lysosomes and Endocytosis GRC/GRS are to 1) provide a comprehensive and integrated platform for
disseminating the latest discoveries related to the function and physiology of the endolysosomal system; 2)
build bridges between basic and disease-focused researchers; and 3) foster discussion of new concepts,
hypotheses, technical approaches, and research collaborations. An important aspect of this is to provide
career development opportunities for new faculty and trainees, along with opportunities for women and others
from underrepresented groups to interact with established and successful scientists. These goals will be
accomplished by a broad-based and inclusive speaking program, poster sessions at which all attendees are
encouraged to present, and intentional efforts to encourage discussion and social interaction outside of
presentations to allow for exchange of ideas and development of collaborations and future training
opportunities. This meeting is the preeminent international conference for advancing research on the
endolysosomal system and will highlight the latest in new understanding of endo-lysosomal function with a
particular emphasis on how defects across the endolysosomal system contribute to the triggering and
progression of neurodegenerative diseases and especially Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias

Urinary tract infections are among the most common healthcare associated infection, of which up to 80% are
due to a urinary catheter. Catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are linked to an increased risk
of recurrent infection, renal damage, and secondary bacteremia. These types of infections have been found to
be largely polymicrobial, with 3 or more species of bacteria present during both asymptomatic colonization and
active infection. We and others have shown that the most common partners are Proteus mirabilis (Pm),
Escherichia coli (Ec), and Enterococcus faecalis (Ef), all of which form robust catheter. Previous work done by
our lab has shown that co-culture of Pm and Ef causes a dramatic increase in biofilm biomass that is mediated
by an increase in biofilm-associated proteins content, and specific adhesins, fimbria, and metabolism-related
proteins were enriched in the polymicrobial biofilm. Our lab has also shown that coinfection with Pm and Ef
increases disease severity in a mouse model of CAUTI, and that biofilm-enhancing interactions contribute to
this process. Considering that CAUTIs often involve various combinations of Pm, Ec, and Ef, and not all dual-
species interactions increase biofilm biomass, there is a gap in knowledge regarding how interactions between
each of these three species influence catheter biofilm formation and infection progression. We aim to examine
the impact of polymicrobial interactions on biofilm architecture, to identify protein mediators of polymicrobial
biofilm enhancement, and determine their contribution to the progression and severity of polymicrobial CAUTI.
Aim 1 will examine the architecture and spatial distribution of each species in single, double, and triple species
biofilms using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution fluorescence microscopy.
Aim 2 will identify and characterize protein mediators of biofilm enhancement using LC-MS/MS. The top three
proteins enriched in polymicrobial biofilms with increased biomass will be selected for further study, and
mutants will be made in each. Using a two-pronged approach, we will determine the contribution of enriched
proteins to biofilm enhancement in our standard 24- well plate assay and in our established “glass bladder”
model, in which biofilms are formed directly on Foley catheters under simulated urine flow. This system is a
physiologically relevant in vitro assay that closely mimics conditions occurring in a catheterized patient. Aim 3
will determine the impact of triple species interactions on infection and severity. Previous data from our lab has
demonstrated that dual species interactions increase the incidence of bacteremia and urolithiasis in the CAUTI
mouse model. We will examine differences in the progression and severity of triple species infection compared
to each dual species infection, and will also determine the contribution of one protein mediator of biofilm
enhancement to polymicrobial infection. Overall, the proposed research will apply a molecular approach to
studying the pathogenesis of polymicrobial CAUTI and is expected to produce valuable insight into contribution
of each microbe to polymicrobial biofilm formation, persistence, and infection severity."

Double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) are a severe form of DNA damage that can give rise to devastating
chromosomal aberrations. While DSBs are usually repaired with high fidelity through homologous recombination
(HR), cells bearing mutations in HR-associated genes such as breast cancer related genes (BRCA)1/2, pivot to
a non-classical DSB repair process called microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Unlike HR, MMEJ is
highly error-prone and can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis. A key player in MMEJ is DNA
polymerase theta (PolΘ), which is recruited to DSBs to carry out the DNA microhomology annealing, strand
separation, and gap-filling processes via a unique DNA DSB repair mechanism that remains poorly understood.
Many cancers, such as BRCA1/2 deficient breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers, exhibit HR pathway
deficiencies and rely heavily on MMEJ, making PolΘ a promising therapeutic target due to its fundamental
involvement in this DNA repair pathway. Successful targeting and inhibition of PolΘ to treat HR-deficient cancers
requires a mechanistic understanding of how PolΘ coordinates MMEJ. To gain new biomedically impactful
insights into these unknown mechanisms, I will combine established biochemical and cell-based assays with
innovative gene editing and structural biology approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanism of MMEJ and
identify intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that are indispensable for efficient MMEJ by PolΘ. During
my first year in the Lander lab, I determined the first DNA-bound structure of the PolΘ helicase domain using a
DNA substrate I identified with a native PAGE screen. This structure reveals the isolated PolΘ helicase domain
performing microhomology annealing, which is the primary initiation step of MMEJ. This structure also reveals
how DNA is threaded through the helicase during MMEJ, a shift in helicase quaternary structure from tetramer
to dimer, and a hinged rotation of both helicase C-terminal domains to accommodate DNA microhomology
annealing between the protomers. These observations provide novel insights into the role of the PolΘ helicase
domain in MMEJ. These preliminary data establish a solid foundation for my studies aimed at (Aim 1) defining
the atomistic relationship between PolΘ and MMEJ DNA substrates and illuminating novel strategies for
development of PolΘ-targeted therapeutics to treat HR-deficient cancers, and (Aim 2) elucidating the cellular
mechanism of MMEJ and investigating cellular consequences of my structural and biochemical insights. These
combined biological and technical studies will address a critical unmet need in BRCA1/2-mutant breast and
ovarian cancers by revealing new strategies for development of PolΘ inhibitors to be investigated as potential
therapeutics for treating HR-deficient myopathies."

This project will utilize protein purification and structure techniques to determine how a novel protein motif, known
as the reverse Bcl-2 homology 3 (rBH3) motif binds to the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1).
MCL1 is a key regulator of cell fate decisions, with MCL1 levels and activity affecting cellular processes that
include apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation. Recent work from my lab has
demonstrated MCL1's direct role in the regulation of many of these processes, and most recently, data from our
lab indicates that MCL1 can directly bind to and activate the apical metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2).
However, despite increasing functional evidence, the structural determinants for MCL1 binding to the rBH3 motif
remain unknown.
Recent data in our lab brings even more interest to how MCL1 binds to and affects rBH3 containing proteins.
MCL1 binding to Hexokinase 2 leads to a 30% increase in hexokinase 2 activity. However, the putative rBH3
motif of hexokinase 2 is located within the active site. Further, while only two residues of the rBH3 motif are
currently known to be necessary, one of these residues is also a catalytically essential residue in the HK2 catalytic
cleft. Therefore, a structure of the complex is necessary for understanding how MCL1 binding can lead to an
increase in activity, and this discovery will provide novel understanding about the function of HK2 and MCL1.
Finally, to determine the structural changes that occur in HK2 upon MCL1 binding, I must first understand the
structure of HK2. Previous structure studies of HK2 have used X-ray crystallography and have relied on the use
of the binding of both substrate and product to HK2 to induce crystal formation. However, the unbound structure
of HK2 as it would be within the cellular environment has not been observed. Therefore, before solving the
structure of the HK2-MCL1 complex, I will solve the structure of apo HK2 utilizing cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-
EM). This will provide the first unbound, native state structure of a bi-domain hexokinase.
At the conclusion of the proposed project, I will have propelled my chosen field of structural biology forward,
while simultaneously preparing myself to be a successful independent investigator of protein structure. Utilizing
cryo-EM to solve the structure of the 104 kDa HK2 protein will be technically innovative as a cryo-EM structure
of a small protein, with structures in the 100 kDa range only being recently achieved by cryo-EM. Further, my
work utilizing binding assays to determine key residues in the rBH3 motif will provide me with a strong
background in protein binding assay design and execution. Finally, my NMR studies, both in regards to binding
and in utilizing NMR to complement the cryo-EM complex structure by solving the structure of the MCL1-rBH3
peptide complex will complete my training as a structural biologist prepared to take on the questions of the future."

Pregnancy relies on finely-tuned adaptations of the maternal immune system to establish and maintain immune-tolerance
to the semi-allogeneic fetus, which appear to be imbalanced in women experiencing complications, such as preterm birth.
Outside the pregnancy context, the central nervous system can modulate systemic immunity via the sympathetic nervous
system, while its role in modulating maternal immune system adaptations during pregnancy remains unknown.
Understanding the determinants of immune regulation throughout pregnancy is a prerequisite to advance the early risk
assessment and treatment of pathological pregnancies. This research project proposes to target the interaction between the
brain, pregnancy, and the immune system. State-of-the-art immunology (mass cytometry) and neuroscience
(neuromodulation of discrete neuronal circuitry) approaches will be combined to comprehensively investigate neuroimmune
regulation of human term and preterm pregnancies and mouse models of pregnancy. Specifically, we hypothesize that a
hyperactive sympathetic (adrenergic) tone enhances systemic pro-inflammatory monocyte responses, thereby contributing
to a compromised fetal tolerance in preterm pregnancies. The first aim of this proposal will monitor the responsiveness
innate pro-inflammatory monocytes to adrenergic signals (using single-cell high-dimensional mass cytometry), and the
nervous-system associated proteome (e.g., adrenergic analytes, Brice Gaudilliere lab) throughout the human third trimester.
This aim is based on my current expertise in human pregnancy immunology and multi-parameter approaches, and a
continuation of my prior in-depth analyses of the pre-labor plasma signature and immunome in the last 100 days of healthy
pregnancy, which accurately predict the onset of labor. In aim 2, to understand brain-pregnancy communication on a
mechanistic level, neuroscience approaches (fiber photometry and chemogenetics) will be used under supervision of the
Luis de Lecea lab, who pioneered cutting-edge neuro-modulatory techniques. Here, I will manipulate discrete neural
populations, known to either suppress or enhance peripheral immunity, throughout late gestation in mouse pregnancies with
the aim to monitor their link to peripheral monocyte responsiveness. Reciprocally, fiber photometry will track pregnancy-
specific alterations in activity of these neural populations. In the third and final aim 3, I will determine whether monocyte
responses to sympathetic signals differ throughout preterm vs. term pregnancies by analyzing maternal blood collected in
each trimester of pregnancy, using high-dimensional single-cell mass cytometry. Machine learning approaches will be
utilized to train a model for preterm vs. term sample classification. In the independent R00 phase, I envision to apply
techniques from immunology and neuroscience to understand pregnancy biology and pathology from a central nervous
system perspective. Together, the set of proposed studies will answer fundamental questions in the nascent field of brain-
peripheral immunity cross-talk, and elucidate understudied mechanism of neuroimmunomodulation in pregnancy, while
significantly aiding in my career development and academic transition to independence."
10906296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor and accounts for approximately 20% of all brain
tumors in children. Medulloblastoma is highly malignant and difficult to treat, resulting in nearly 30% of affected
patients being incurable. Additionally, even children that are cured suffer from severe long-term deficiencies
primarily due to the adverse side effects of radiation therapy on the growing and developing child's brain.
Survivors suffer from memory, attention deficits, decreased IQ, cognitive and learning disabilities, thyroid and
gonadal dysfunction (infertility), and growth delay. It is estimated that fewer than 20% of medulloblastoma
survivors who reach adulthood can live independent lives. Therefore, more effective and less toxic therapies
are greatly needed for patients with medulloblastoma.
While medulloblastoma is composed of primitive undifferentiated neuroblasts, some tumors show foci of
spontaneous maturation into a non-proliferative brain-like tissue resembling neuronal differentiation processes
during normal brain development. We hypothesize that spontaneous maturation is epigenetically driven; by
elucidating the drivers of spontaneous maturation, novel therapeutic avenues can be identified that will allow
us to induce maturation in the clinic and force the malignant tumor into benign brain-like tissue. We show that
mature and primitive areas in medulloblastoma have distinctly different RNA expression patterns and that
PRC2 is a master regulator of this process in human tissue samples and animal models.
In this proposal, we aim to hijack neurodevelopmental processes for therapy of MB by exploring the
mechanism of spontaneous maturation to identify the pathways regulated by PRC2 through the following
specific aims: 1) Integrating molecular dissection of epigenetic machinery and transcriptomics in mature and
primitive components of human medulloblastoma, 2) Elucidate the role of EZH2 in epigenetic regulation of
tumor cell maturation in mouse SHH MB, and 3) Assess the efficacy and toxicity of tumor vasculature- targeted
EZH2 and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway inhibition in SHH-driven medulloblastoma. We will utilize high-
resolution genomics and epigenetics techniques, a genetically relevant mouse medulloblastoma model that
recapitulates the human disease, and a novel tumor vasculature-specific nanoparticle drug delivery platform
that allows penetration past the blood-brain barrier.
Our long-term objective is to identify tumor-selective epigenetic strategies to induce spontaneous maturation
that synergize with the current standard of care therapies for medulloblastoma. Should our results prove
favorable, we envision applicability to patients with medulloblastoma and other brain tumors."

The Molecular, Genetic, and Cellular Targets of Cancer Training Program (TCTP; formerly the Cancer Biology
Training Grant) at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center (MCC) combines rigorous training in
laboratory-based cancer research with interdisciplinary and translational perspectives that prepares TCTP
trainees for independent research careers focused on discovery of the mechanisms of cancer development and
progression. Our trainees who do not choose an academic path are highly competitive for leadership positions
in a variety of science-related careers. Now in its 44th year of NCI support, the TCTP supports 4 predoctoral and
5 postdoctoral trainees. The 36 preceptors provide research training in three interrelated areas of molecular,
genetic, and cellular cancer research that represent particular strengths at the MCC: molecular targets & cancer
cell signaling, cancer genetics/epigenetics & DNA damage/repair, and cellular targets & cancer
immunology/immunotherapy. The Program consists of intensive one-on-one research mentoring, didactic
training in cancer biology and basic and translational cancer research, and regular meetings where trainees
develop critical presentation skills, obtain feedback, and establish new research collaborations. Trainees also
participate in networking opportunities with prominent external cancer research scientists, and take part in career
development activities. Historically, participation of the TCTP Director and Steering Committee members in key
leadership positions associated with biomedical research and technology, graduate education, career
development, mentoring, and trainee recruitment at the University of Minnesota, have enhanced the TCTP
applicant pool and improved the career outcomes of trainees. These efforts have also enhanced our success at
recruiting individuals from under-represented groups. New initiatives during the next funding period include a
recurring financial commitment from the Medical School and the MCC to support a postdoctoral fellow (salary
and benefits), expanding our training capability to 6 postdoctoral trainees. In addition, we will implement short
training modules focused on essential skill sets requested by our postdoctoral trainees, including cancer
bioinformatics/omics, emerging technologies and “hot topics” in cancer research, as well as new workshops
focused on navigating career transitions. Finally, we have recently partnered with the University of Wisconsin
Training in Cancer Biology Training Grant for program-specific retreats. These regional gatherings, designed to
enhance trainee networking and regional exposure, will include scientific content as well as career development
and mentoring activities designed to meet the specific needs of pre- vs. postdoctoral trainees. These
improvements will ensure a robust future of the highest quality training in the molecular, genetic, and cellular
mechanisms of cancer at the University of Minnesota. The TCTP is central to the MCC’s mission of educating
and training the next generation of scientists and leaders pursuing solutions to the problem of cancer."
10906652,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are four levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUSs) approved by the U.S.
FDA. However, to date, there are no approved generic LNG-IUSs. Development of LNG-IUSs is
challenging: 1) long acting (up to 5 years); 2) locally acting; and 3) drug-device combination
products. Under our U.S. FDA grant (RFA-FD-15-006), we have successfully developed and
optimized a processing method for qualitatively and quantitatively (Q1/Q2) equivalent LNG-IUSs
using Mirena® as the reference product. Physicochemical characterization methods, and a
reliable real-time release testing method with discriminatory capability, have been developed. This
allowed determination of the impact of drug particle size, physical structure (dimensions and
configuration of the device) as well as the source of the outer membrane on in vitro drug release.
We have also established accelerated testing methods using hydro-organic media. With these
methods in hand, the next logical step to enable development of generic equivalents of the LNG-
IUSs is to understand the design space of LNG-IUSs based on the quality target product profiles
(QTPPs). Accordingly, it is now necessary to systematically investigate the impact of critical
process parameters (CPPs), formulation variations, and the device physical structure (dimensions
and configuration) on the release profiles. This will require the development of non-Q1/Q2
equivalent LNG-IUSs, since Q1/Q2 equivalent formulations are limited in terms of the composition
and concentration of the excipients. Over the past two decades, our laboratory has made
considerable contributions to the formulation development and in vitro release testing (both real-
time and accelerated) of many different long-acting complex parenteral drug products. In
collaboration with the FDA, we have developed appropriate in vitro approaches to enable
bioequivalence recommendations for these complex parenteral drug products, through evaluation
of the impact of raw material attributes, as well as processing and formulation parameters on their
performance. Building on this knowledge, it is now proposed to develop a manufacturing method
for LNG-IUSs suitable for adaption to commercial manufacturing that will allow identification of
the CPPs and evaluation of their impact on the critical quality attributes (CQAs). The influence of
processing parameters, formulation variations and device physical structure on the release rate
of LNG-IUSs will be quantitatively determined. In addition, a robust accelerated release testing
method will be developed to reduce the time for in vitro performance testing. Liletta® (a similar
product to Mirena®) will be investigated as a second commercial comparator. This research will
facilitate the establishment of bioequivalence recommendations for generic LNG-IUSs."
10872352,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a collection of inherited peripheral neuropathies with a cumulative
incidence of ~1:2500 people. There is no approved treatment for any of the 100 genetic subtypes of CMT,
presenting a large unmet clinical need. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2D is caused by dominant mutations in glycyl
tRNA synthetase (GARS), encoding the enzyme that charges glycine onto its cognate tRNAs during translation.
Our working model for the disease mechanism is that the mutant enzyme binds its tRNA substrate, but does not
release it to the ribosome, effectively sequestering the substrate. This results in ribosome stalling at glycine
codons and activation of the integrated stress response. Support for this mechanism comes from genetic studies
in Drosophila and mouse models of CMT2D, in which transgenic overexpression of tRNAGlyGCC was able to
effectively suppress the neuropathy phenotype. In preliminary studies, we have reproduced this result using
AAV9 to deliver tRNAGly genes to three different CMT2D mouse models. Glycine has four codons (GGC, GGG,
GGA, and GGU), and therefore four potential anticodons (GCC, CCC, UCC, and ACC respectively, though ACC
is likely a nonfunctional tRNA). We made four AAV9 vectors expressing each tRNAGly anticodon driven by a
PolIII U6 promoter. We found that GCC was highly effective, almost completely suppressing the neuropathy
phenotype even in mice with a severe allele of Gars. Vectors expressing CCC and UCC were intermediate in
efficacy, and ACC was ineffective (as anticipated). This profile of efficacy correlates with tRNA abundance and
codon usage, and suggests we are replacing the sequestered substrates of GARS with the AAVs. In the R61
phase of this proposal we will optimize the vector payload (Aim 1) and capsid (Aim 2), and in the R33 phase
(Aim 3), we will use this optimized vector in rigorous preclinical studies in mouse models of CMT2D. In Aim 1
(R61), we will construct an AAV9 vector that carries all three effective tRNAGly genes (GCC, CCC, UCC) in a
single vector. We will compare this against GCC alone, which was very effective. In Aim 2 (R61), we will
recreate the U6-GCC vector in a MACPNS capsid in an attempt to create a vector that is effective with systemic
delivery, rather than dosing directly into the nervous system. We will compare the MACPNS-GCC vector to
AAV9-GCC. In Aim 3 (R33), we will test the optimized vector (GCC or combined tRNAGlys, AAV9 or MACPNS)
in two mouse models of CMT2D. We will also allow treated mice to age to show the perdurance of the effect,
and we will examine the effects of treating after the onset of neuropathy. The successful completion of these
aims will show the in vivo efficacy of an optimized gene therapy treatment for CMT2D in preclinical studies in
mouse models. This will position us for further translational research and IND-enabling studies through
mechanisms such as the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network for Biologicals."
10872351,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The risks of ideating, suicide attempt (SA), and dying by suicide have never been greater for Mexican
teens. In the past two decades, the rates of suicidal behaviors (SB) among Mexican youth have shown a 3.4-
fold increase. Today, 2.8% of Mexican teens ages 15 to 19 report SA (3.8% females, 0.3% boys). Even though
reported SA are lower in Mexican youth compared to their U.S. counterparts, this has become a critical issue
given its increase in Mexico, the lack of Evidence Based Practices (EBP), and its future clinical implications.
SB have sobering implications for the future well-being of Mexican youth, as they are associated with a myriad
of short- and long-term negative outcomes, including premature death. Suicidal youth in Mexico, 50% of them
who are or were in contact with providers, do not have access to the quality treatments developed in and
available to their counterparts in high-income nations. This access disparity is not unique to Mexico; most
suicidal youth in other middle and low-income nations (LMIC) are not treated with quality interventions
available in rich nations. Moreover, youth in LMIC have high rates of SB and 75% of all suicides occur in these
nations. This is a mental health care injustice that demands urgent resolution.
 This NIMH R34 award application proposes to conduct an adaptation, implementation, and pilot testing of
the culturally centered CBT protocol, the Socio-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Suicidal Behaviors (SCBT-
SB), among suicidal youth in Mexico City, Mexico. SCBT-SB is a psychosocial treatment developed with the
support of the NIMH specifically for suicidal Latinx youth. SCBT-SB is available in Spanish, has an established
training model, and has yielded promising results in intent to treat analyses in reducing SA and depressive
symptoms in comparison to treatment as usual (TAU). Furthermore, it is the CBT protocol with the most
empirical evidence for Latinx youth with SB. SCBT is attuned to the cultural needs of Latinx suicidal youth in
real-world service settings. This will be the first time that SCBT-SB, and for that matter, any suicidal ideation
and behaviors evidence-based treatment, will be used in Mexico to treat suicidal youth in contact with mental
health services in the public health sector. By implementing and pilot testing SCBT-SB with suicidal Mexican
youth, this project addresses profound gaps in services for this population and of training for clinicians.
 The research plan will (a) culturally adapt and contextualize the SCBT-SB for its implementation in the
Mexican public health system, (b) pilot test the protocol through an RCT (SCBT-SB vs TAU; 60 patients and
caregivers) and (c) evaluate the implementation process of the SCBT-SB and assess qualitatively possible
factors that may promote or hinder its future uptake. The short and long-term knowledge and research
implications include (a) its potential to improve the lives of suicidal Mexican youth; (b) the knowledge about
transnational implementation of EBTs in the Mexican public health sector; and (c) the understanding of the
implementation and treatment effect of SCBT-SB in Mexico."

This application requests five more years of support for a highly successful training program at the University
of New Mexico (UNM) Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addictions (CASAA). The program,
initiated in 2010, has trained 26 pre- and postdoctoral trainees for careers in alcohol research. Support is
requested for 4 pre-doctoral trainees, drawn from the Department of Psychology, and 3 post-doctoral trainees
from disciplines relevant to the goals of the training program, such as psychology, sociology, psychiatry, social
work, population health, and economics. The training program prepares future scientists to develop and test
effective models for impacting change in alcohol use through improved approaches to treatment and indicated
prevention, to conduct research on processes of change in drinking behavior, and to develop and test models
to disseminate knowledge of effective interventions and change processes to diverse populations. Central
questions that trainees address include: (1) What factors stimulate change in at-risk and clinical populations?
(2) What psychological, social, and neurobiological mechanisms underlie successful change at the individual
level? (3) How does modeling of different trajectories of change contribute to understanding change
processes? (4) What types of interventions are more and less effective in supporting recovery from alcohol use
disorder (AUD), and, equally important, what specific aspects of treatments account for their effectiveness? (5)
How do change processes and interventions vary based on individual differences (e.g., genetic profiles,
sociodemographic characteristics, co-morbidity, social/cultural environment) and how can examination of
individual differences inform precision medicine for AUD? (6) What are effective and efficient approaches to
disseminate evidence-based interventions and knowledge about change processes to practitioners and diverse
populations? The program is directed and run at the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addictions
(CASAA), a multidisciplinary center devoted to treatment, prevention, and epidemiological research on alcohol
and other substance use. The UNM Department of Psychology and the Mind Research Network, a private,
non-profit neuroimaging center on the UNM campus, are important contributing partners. Ten core faculty
serve as primary preceptors for trainees. These faculty members have strong records of mentorship and
research on effective models of prevention and treatment to reduce alcohol-related harm, research on
neurocognitive and behavioral mechanisms of behavior change, studies with diverse populations, and
dissemination research. The 15 contributing faculty bring complementary expertise in neurobiology and
neurocognition, emerging methodologies in alcohol research, behavioral interventions, diverse populations,
and dissemination science, and provide content expertise and opportunities for secondary research

10875282,"Map Leukemia-immune Cell Communication with Nanoplasmon Ruler in CAR T-Cell Immunotherapy
Genetically engineered T-cells modified with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) targeting CD19 provide an
innovative method for treating cancer, especially for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Unfortunately,
practical application of this immunotherapy is greatly hindered by the unsatisfactory CAR T-cell function, long-
lasting B cell aplasia and accompanied cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Improved therapeutic and preventive
treatments require comprehensive understanding of the complex and dynamic cytokine secretion behavior of
CAR T-cells and their communication with cancer cells and other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment.
More importantly, real-time and traceable monitoring of both the location and timing of cytokine secretion would
enable mechanistic understanding of CAR T-cell physiopathology in initiation, activation, communication and
subsequent functional responses in leukemic bone marrow immunity. Such spatiotemporal monitoring technique
is critically lacking within existing clinical practices, which are primarily based on measurements under “static”
conditions. Thus, there is an emerging need for platforms that allow direct visualization and mapping of cytokine
production, diffusion, transportation for better understanding the highly heterogeneous functional diversity of
polyfunctional CAR T-cells and immune cell communications. To address this need, the central objectives of this
proposal are to develop novel integrated `nanoplamson ruler'-based nanosensing technology to resolve the
temporal dynamics of cytokine secretion from individual CD19 CAR T-cells and the crosstalk with B-ALL cells
and bone marrow immune suppressor cells. The success of this technology will allow, for the first time, the direct
visualization of multiplex cytokine secretion from individual CAR T-cell in a high-sensitivity, multiplex, label-free,
in situ and real-time traceable manner. The proposed platform would provide a detailed and time-dependent
mechanisms of how CAR T-cell response to stimulation and evolve in a suppressive niche for preclinical

10875283,"SUMMARY
The diet quality of U.S. childbearing aged women is worse now than any time in the last 50 years. Poor diet
quality has been linked with adverse pregnancy outcomes that contribute to infant mortality and pose a
tremendous societal burden. Nevertheless, formal recommendations on the diet patterns that promote healthy
pregnancy outcomes are lacking. The US Congress recently mandated that dietary advice for pregnancy be
included in the next edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans—the major nutrition policy document that
provides dietary advice for health promotion. The USDA/HHS Pregnancy Work Group, which included PI Lisa
Bodnar, was charged with summarizing existing knowledge on diet patterns that support healthy pregnancy
outcomes to inform the pregnancy-specific guidelines. They identified an evidence base that was entirely
insufficient for deriving empirical recommendations and called for research to fill this critical knowledge gap.
Our objective is to generate empirical evidence that will inform national dietary guidance on the diet patterns
that promote healthy pregnancy outcomes. We hypothesize that our results will suggest dietary
recommendations for pregnant women that will diverge from prevailing nutrition advice. We expect this
divergence because our innovative approaches will accommodate the complex synergy among foods in the
diet. Using a large, prospective cohort of 7995 U.S. women enrolled at 8 U.S. academic centers, we will
quantify the contribution of dietary patterns to variation in risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth
<37 weeks, small-for-gestational-age birth, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia). We will use machine
learning techniques that allow for complex interactions among dietary components. Then, we will generalize
recommended dietary patterns in our sample to the U.S. population of pregnant women using cutting edge
“transportability” methods developed in the causal inference literature. Finally, we will develop machine
learning algorithms that will identify subgroups who will benefit most from dietary pattern recommendations.
The successful completion of this project will provide the Dietary Guidelines Scientific Advisory Committee with
empirically-derived data on the ideal dietary patterns for promoting healthy pregnancy outcomes. Our
innovative methodologies will serve as a template for nutritional epidemiologists in other areas of health to
apply to their data, leading to a broad impact on the Dietary Guidelines. Developing practical data-driven
dietary recommendations to optimize pregnancy outcomes will help to reduce the high economic and societal
burden of adverse pregnancy outcomes and improve the health of mothers and their children."
10875284,"Abstract. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (pancreatic cancer, PDAC) is the classic example of a recalcitrant
tumor that is extremely challenging to treat. Therapeutic strategies which can bypass the desmoplasia `fortress'
and access hypoxic microenvironments without significantly affecting healthy cells would address the critical
issues presented by PDAC physiology. Localized therapies are a critical component of PDAC treatment and
there is strong interest in innovative ways to intensify radiation therapy (RT). A novel approach to enhancing the
radiation dose delivered to tumors is to increase the radiation-interaction probability of the target tissues by
delivering high atomic number (Z) nanoparticles (e.g., gold or hafnium oxide) to tumor cells. However, due to
the exuberant desmoplasia characteristic of PDAC, the diffusion of even the smallest nanoparticles is limited by
the dense stroma making delivery to cancer cells exceedingly challenging. Furthermore, recent evidence
confirms that depleting the stroma may not be the answer since the stroma restrains and confines cancer cells
to within the pancreas rather than promotes the growth of cancer cells. We contend that the ideal strategy is to
penetrate the stroma without destroying it. Here we address this delivery barrier standing in the way of effective
radiosensitization of PDAC tumors by employing a recently reported process of in situ gold biomineralization by
mammalian cancer cells. This strategy will allow replacement of pre-synthetized radiosensitizing gold
nanoparticles (GNPs) with ionic gold atoms thus achieving the smallest possible size of a therapeutic agent – a
single ionic atom. Our hypothesis is that small gold ions (i) will uniformly distribute throughout the tumor as their
diffusion is not likely to be impeded by the stroma, (ii) will be reduced to GNPs via the process of in situ
biomineralization after specific uptake by cancer cells, and (iii) will radiosensitize the tumor while sparing
adjacent normal tissue. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary data demonstrating a strong
radiosensitization effect in PDAC cells by the intracellularly synthetized GNPs both in vitro and in vivo. In addition,
normal pancreatic cells synthesized significantly fewer GNPs than cancer cells, consistent with recent reports
showing higher efficiency of in situ gold biomineralization in cancer vs. non-cancer cells. Further, a long history
of the clinical use of gold-salt based drugs in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can provide a clear path towards
clinical translation. In this project we have devised comprehensive mechanistic studies to evaluate and to
optimize in situ biomineralization for efficient radiosensitization of PDAC. To this end we will carry out studies in
three synergistic Aims: (1) to determine the mechanism of and to optimize conditions for intracellular synthesis
of GNPs by PDAC cells; (2) to evaluate the determinants of radiosensitization efficacy in vitro and in vivo; and
(3) to develop a predictive biological effect computational model of radiosensitization by in situ synthetized GNPs.
These studies will provide the framework for continued development of a readily deployable radiosensitization
strategy for pancreatic cancer that can be extended to other unresectable solid tumors."
10883582,"Inorganic metals have long been a focus of biomedical research in New Mexico, owing both to the prevalence
of mining-related metal contaminants in the region, as well as our interest in harnessing the chemical
properties of metals for therapeutic or nutritional purposes. We have a recognized need in New Mexico to

biomedical sciences. The University of New Mexico Center for Metals in Biology and Medicine (UNM CMBM)
will address this by combining expertise in inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry, and metal mixtures
toxicology to add sophistication and translational value to the research of mentored principal investigators
(mPIs). Junior scientists will be trained with an emphasis on team science mentoring and multidisciplinary

institutional visibility and sustainability, as the AC fosters development of a well-coordinated group of
interactive and successful investigators. We expect that AC activities will contribute to extramural funding of
multiple new programs, including research projects for mPIs, institutional resources, and new collaborative
awards to established investigators in the Center. Such outcomes are expected to have an important positive

10883585,"INTEGRATIVE MOLECULAR ANALYSIS CORE – PROJECT SUMMARY
In the rapidly changing field of Metals in Biology and Medicine, research needs are diverse and complex.
Currently, advances in inorganic biochemistry – and its application to biomedical phenomena – require
sophisticated integration of molecular analyses, including the ability to identify and quantitate trace metal
speciation and metal interactions with biomolecular targets. These analyses require highly trained personnel
with specialized expertise and access to advanced high-end equipment, beyond what is typically available in
most individual research laboratories. The Integrative Molecular Analysis Core (IMAC) provides the UNM
Center for Metals in Biology and Medicine investigators with the necessary expertise and tools for a variety of
modern molecular analyses, including ICP-MS, EPR spin-trapping, and quantitative mass spectrometry.
Moreover, the Core provides in-house analyses, supports innovative protocol development, and provides
training to students, fellows, and faculty in the integrated applications associated with the advanced analytical
instrumentation present in the IMAC facility. The Core additionally leverages access to several other existing
on-campus core facilities to enable innovative biomolecular methods, and provides these services at
subsidized pricing. Even more important than access to the technology, the IMAC provides tailored expertise to
investigators to assist in the design of molecular analyses and data interpretation, to optimize use of valuable
biological samples and resources. The facility will be managed by a cadre of specialists with strong
complementary expertise in molecular analysis, research facility administration, training, and mentoring of
junior faculty. The Core equipment is primarily housed in dedicated space in close proximity to most users.
This centralization of resources and knowledge provides consolidated and cost-effective analytical services
and technical expertise to the Center members and users. The Core is organized in three units: Metals
Analytical Chemistry, Oxidative Stress, and Biological Mass Spectrometry. The Specific Aims of this Core are:
1) to create a centralized, state-of-the-art resource that provides expertise, training and instrumentation for
integrative molecular analysis, focused on metal interactions with biological systems; 2) to support the
research objectives of mentored PIs and cultivate a new cohort of COBRE investigators within the Center for
Metals in Biology and Medicine; and 3) develop a user base of established, funded investigators for continued
growth and sustainability of the core facility. The expected outcomes include enhanced multidisciplinary
research capabilities that support metals programs of mentored PIs in their trajectory toward R01 level funding,

10893368,"Abstract/Project Summary:
In the US, youth and young adults living with HIV (YLWH) have lower rates of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
initiation, suboptimal ART adherence and retention in care, and higher rates of virologic failure, compared to
older age groups. Additionally, there is an increased risk of substance dependence, psychiatric disorders, and
mortality with increased risk of substance use at a younger age. Mental health (MH) and substance use (SU)
impact every step of the HIV care continuum from diagnosis to viral suppression and exacerbate
socioeconomic challenges of linkage and sustained access to healthcare. Given the strong evidence for the
influence of MH and SU on poor HIV health outcomes, there is a clear need for increased access to and
provision of these services. Despite the need to address these critical barriers to care in YLWH, there is a
severe shortage of MH professionals nationwide and a lack of interventions tailored to this age group.
In collaboration with the nonprofit AIDS Healthcare Foundation (the largest provider of HIV care) and a
Youth Advisory Panel, the proposed study aims to address these barriers in a tailored manner using a
differentiated care approach that is “youth-friendly.” Our goal is to test the effect of a tailored technology-based
intervention in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) with an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) among 200 YLWH
(18–29 years old). The intervention includes: (1) brief weekly counseling sessions with a counselor to discuss
MH, SU, HIV care engagement, and other barriers to care delivered via a video-chat platform, and (2) a mobile
health application designed and developed using Human-Centered Design (HCD) with YLWH to address
barriers to engagement in care. Individuals who are not virologically suppressed will be randomized to video-
counseling+app or standard of care (SOC). Through this entirely remotely-conducted study, we will be able to:
Aim 1: Test the efficacy of video-counseling+app vs SOC on virologic suppression in YLWH. We will compare
HIV virologic suppression of those randomized to the intervention vs control arms at 16 weeks via an RCT.
Aim 2: Assess the impact of video-counseling+app vs SOC on MH and SU in YLWH. We will evaluate the MH
and SU differences between the intervention vs control arms at 16 weeks via an RCT.
Aim 3: Explore an ATS to individualize the intervention by assigning the:
 (a) virologic “non-responders” in the intervention arm to intensified video-counseling+app for 16 more weeks,
 (b) virologic “responders” in the intervention arm to continue only app use for 16 more weeks.
Therefore, in an era of severe shortages of MH providers when MH and SU challenges of YLWH are critical
barriers to care, examining an innovative intervention developed using HCD with a differentiated care approach
directed specifically to YLWH, grounded in a well-established theoretical model of care and formative research,
and with community partnership is necessary for “getting to zero” and ending the HIV epidemic."
10893369,"ABSTRACT
 The atmospheric content of greenhouse gases, such as methane, has long been ruled by microbes, such
as methanotrophs. Recent human activity has upset this homeostasis, presenting an appreciable risk to human
health in the present and future. Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO), a copper-dependent
transmembrane enzyme from methanotrophic bacteria, oxidizes methane to methanol. Its ability to perform this
difficult chemical reaction at ambient temperature and pressure offers a window into developing processes for
conversion of biological natural gas to liquid (Bio-GTL) for climate change mitigation. Isolation of pMMO from the
membranes and detergent solubilization have hindered past studies, resulting in a loss of enzymatic activity and
distortion of protein structure. The failure of detergent micelles to recapitulate the physicochemical properties of
the membrane may perturb functionally important metal centers, protein-lipid interactions, and protein-protein
interactions. These challenges can be overcome by reconstituting pMMO in membrane mimetics like membrane
scaffold protein (MSP) nanodiscs (NDs) and bicelles using homogeneous synthetic lipid bilayers, which enable
partial recovery of pMMO activity and structure. The goal of this project is to explore the role of the native
membrane in pMMO structure and function. Aim 1 is to optimize pMMO activity in detergent-free native ND
systems. Preliminary data show that it is possible to reconstitute pMMO activity in NDs using native lipids
extracted from methanotrophs. These native lipid NDs exhibit activity comparable to or better than pMMO in
synthetic lipid NDs. Aim 2 is to characterize the membrane environment and its interaction with pMMO.
This information will be used to optimize membrane mimetics for delineating the effects of lipid environment on
pMMO structure and function. Untargeted and targeted lipidomics via mass spectrometry will be used to catalog
the major lipid classes and identify specific lipid species, while also determining their relative abundances in
native lipid extracts and membrane mimetics. Native mass spectrometry will provide insight into specific protein-
lipid interactions that occur within membrane mimetics, informing the modeling of these interactions in cryoEM
and crystal structures. Aim 3 is to characterize the structural effects of membrane mimetic environments
on pMMO. More native-like membrane mimetics may allow for determination of a more biologically relevant
pMMO structure by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM). These studies will provide insight into the
importance of the membrane for pMMO function, including crucial details about the pMMO structure, copper
centers, transmembrane loops, protein-lipid interactions, protein-protein interactions, physiological reductant,
active site, and mechanism. This project may also provide generalizable information about the importance of the
native membrane environment for studying membrane proteins."
10893480,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The prevalence of obesity and diabetes continue to rise unabated in the United States,
creating a grave social and economic burden. Although development of these diseases is
multi-faceted and complex, there is accumulating evidence for the impact of environmental
chemical exposures on metabolic homeostasis. Currently, glyphosate is the most commonly
used herbicide in the United States, however, to date, no studies have ever assessed whether
glyphosate exposure impacts the development of obesity and diabetes. Thus, the long-term
goal of this project is to better understand how recent and current pesticide usage can impact
long-term metabolic homeostasis.
 Glyphosate targets the shikimate pathway found in plants, and not mammals, leading
to the assumption of its general safety. However, glyphosate can also target bacteria, and
glyphosate exposure results in an altered gut microbiome profile. Despite the fact that
previous pesticides are associated with metabolic disease, and that glyphosate is known to
alter the gut microbiota which can impact energy and glucose homeostasis, no study has ever
examined whether exposure to glyphosate can result in development of obesity and/or
diabetes. One of the main roles of the gut microbiota is bile acid metabolism, and studies
suggest that alterations in bile acid signaling represent a plausible link between the gut
microbiota and regulation of metabolic homeostasis via changes in Farnesoid X receptor
(FXR) signaling. These facts, coupled with our preliminary data, led to the hypothesis that
exposure to glyphosate shifts the gut microbiome, leading to altered intestinal bile acid
signaling that contributes to impairments in energy and glucose homeostasis. This hypothesis
will be tested in 3 aims: 1) assess if exposure to glyphosate during different developmental
timepoints promotes metabolic dysfunction in male and female mice on a chow or high-fat diet,
2) determine the role of the gut microbiome in the effects of glyphosate exposure on metabolic
homeostasis, and 3) identify the impact of altered bile acid signaling via glyphosate exposure
in impaired metabolic homeostasis. The proposed study will be the first ever to provide
mechanistic insight of the effects of glyphosate exposure on metabolic homeostasis. This
proposal will provide valuable data leading to further research examining how environmental
pesticide usage can affect human health, and possibly identify microbial targets to offset the
detrimental effects of environmental chemical use."
10893489,"Immunosuppressive myeloid cells including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)
contribute to multiple steps of cancer development. A better understanding of the
molecular regulation of the functions of these myeloid cells and the signaling pathways
will support development of novel anti-cancer therapeutic strategies. The leukocyte Ig-like
receptor subfamily B (LILRB) proteins are a group of immune inhibitory receptors with
intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs. We have been studying the
roles of these receptors in cancer development and immune regulation. The studies by us
and others suggest that the LILRB family is becoming the next wave of myeloid immune
checkpoint targets for cancer treatment. Here we demonstrated that LILRB3, a myeloid-
specific member of this family, is functionally expressed on human MDSCs, and supports
cancer development in mouse models. Importantly, we identified galectin-4 as an
extracellular protein that binds to LILRB3 and induces LILRB3 activation, and the
intracellular domain of LILRB3 interacts with the adaptor protein TRAF2 to contribute to
NFκB upregulation. Furthermore, we developed anti-LILRB3 blocking antibodies that
efficiently inhibit immunosuppressive activity of human MDSCs in vitro and cancer
development in xenografted humanized mice and in LILRB3-transgenic mice. Our study
suggests that LILRB3 represents an attractive novel target for cancer treatment. Based
on new preliminary results, we propose the following Aims to test the hypothesis that
LILRB3-initiated signaling in immunosuppressive myeloid cells supports cancer
development. In Aim 1, we will determine the function of LILRB3 expressed on myeloid
cells in cancer development. We will then determine whether galectin-4 regulates LILRB3-
mediated signaling in tumor microenvironment to support cancer development in Aim 2.
Finally we will dissect LILRB3 signaling in immunosuppressive myeloid cells in Aim 3. Our
study will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which LILRB3 regulates the activity of
immunosuppressive myeloid cells, and lead to the development of innovative anti-cancer
strategies based on targeting LILRB3 signaling."
10894257,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT BIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS CORE
The primary objective of the Biological Analysis Core (BAC) of the JAX-Sen mouse Tissue Mapping Center
(TMC) is to provide high resolution state-of-the-art molecular, cellular, and tissue-level characterization of
mouse tissues for the purpose of identifying robust biomarkers of senescence and, from this, build tissue-
specific atlases at the cellular, microenvironment, and secretome levels. The BAC will generate high resolution,
high content, high-throughput biomolecular data to generate comprehensive maps of cellular senescence in six
primary mouse tissues, across two mouse model systems - a large cohort of Diversity Outbred (DO) mice
representing genetic diversity and the required C57BL/6 strain. To achieve these goals, the BAC will 1)
develop and apply a pipeline to generate unbiased, high-quality, high-resolution, and high-throughput datasets
to discover biomarkers of senescence, 2) develop a high-throughput, high-content tissue phenotyping pipeline
and apply this to a cohort of 400 DO mice, 3) generate high biomolecular content, multi-parameter spatial
measurements on 2D serial sections to enable 3D tissue reconstruction, and 4) leverage p16/p21 reporter
mouse lines to comprehensively profile senescent cells sorted from aged mice. Once complete, this project will
have generated multi-scale, multi-dimensional maps of senescence cells within six mouse tissues from control
and senolytics treated tissues, information that will be critical to optimize and guide future senolytic
interventions in human trials."
10894259,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT DATA ANALYSIS CORE
The objective of the Data Analysis Core (DAC) of the JAX-Sen mouse Tissue Mapping Center (TMC) is to
construct biomarker datasets and molecular maps of cellular senescence in mice and deliver these data to the
SenNet Consortium Organization and Data Coordinating Center (CODCC). The Biological Analysis Core (BAC)
of JAX-Sen will generate high-resolution, high-content molecular data to characterize cellular senescence in
mouse kidney, adipose tissue, pancreas, placenta, heart and hypothalamus in aged, inbred and genetically
diverse mouse cohorts. From these data, the DAC will establish state-of-the-art workflows for data annotation,
curation, and analysis of transcriptomic, imaging, and imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) data to build cellular
senescence maps. The DAC will collaborate closely with the DAC of the human SenNet TMC at JAX and UConn
Health (KAPP-Sen TMC), other human and mouse TMCs and the CODCC to develop and implement Network-
wide standards for processing, analyzing and visualizing SenNet data. The JAX-Sen DAC will leverage
significant recent advances in deep learning and computer vision to define robust biomarkers of senescent cells
and map their tissue context. To achieve its goals, the JAX-Sen DAC will implement rigorous and reproducible
data annotation, curation, processing, and dissemination (Aim 1). The DAC will receive and centralize
sequencing, imaging, and IMS data from the JAX-Sen BAC. It will automate and harden QC procedures to screen
for annotation and curation errors, batch effects, and low-quality samples in collaboration with the BAC. The
DAC will implement the pipelines based on common community standards, benchmark on JAX-Sen and
reference datasets, and then containerize for sharing with the CODCC. From these data, the JAX-Sen DAC will
construct biomarker datasets and molecular maps of cellular senescence (Aim 2). The DAC will deploy analysis
pipelines for sequencing, image and IMS data with known and prospective senescence markers to identify and
functionally annotate novel biomarkers of senescent cells and map their tissue context, compute the diversity
within senescent cell populations, and quantify cell-to-cell interactions between senescent cells and neighboring
cells. The DAC will aggregate and integrate these data and metadata to build high-quality maps of cellular
senescence. Finally, the JAX-Sen DAC will disseminate JAX-Sen data with rigorous and reproducible open-
source processing pipelines (Aim 3). The DAC will harmonize, standardize, and disseminate data processing
and analytic pipelines with the CODCC, adhering to common community standards, standard operating
procedures, and the network data sharing policy to exact reproducibility. We will collaborate with KAPP-Sen and
other CODCC projects and TMCs to identify synergy, e.g., align human and mouse biomarkers on the same

10897940,"My research in the Farnham lab is centered on the ZFX family of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factors (TFs),
including the highly related ZFX, ZFY, and ZNF711. Previously, our lab established CRISPR-mediated knock
outs of ZFX and ZNF711 in HEK293T cells and demonstrated defective proliferation and altered expression of
thousands of genes. Additional preliminary data from the Farnham lab has determined that ZFX and ZNF711
function as transcriptional activators which preferentially bind +240 bp downstream of transcription start sites
(TSSs) at the majority of CpG island promoters in HEK293T cells. Further ZFX ChIP-seq experiments in
several human cell lines revealed that the majority of ZFX binding occurs at the same promoters in all tested
cell lines. Interestingly, RNA-seq experiments in these cell lines after ZFX siRNA knockdown revealed cell-type
specific sets of ZFX-bound, downregulated genes. However, the transcriptional mechanisms by which ZFX
regulates cell type-specific gene expression remain unclear. Therefore, in my proposal, I will determine how
ZFX can regulate a distinct set of target genes in each cell type when it binds to mostly the same set of
promoters in the different cell types. I hypothesize that ZFX interacts with different protein partners in
each cell type to provide cell type-specific regulation from common promoter binding sites. In Aim#1, I
propose to identify proteins that interact with ZFX in multiple cell lines using IP-MS and a sensitive proximity
labeling technique TurboID-MS. Candidate ZFX binding partners will be individually validated with co-IP and in
situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) experiments. To determine if candidates are key mediators of ZFX-regulated
transcription, RNA-seq experiments after siRNA knockdown of corresponding mRNAs will be performed. I also
aim to construct ZFX mutants, focusing first on the highly conserved peptide regions in the N-terminal
transactivation domain, and perform co-IP experiments to map sites of protein interaction followed by
transactivation assays to determine the effects of these mutations on transcription. In Aim#2, I will perform
motif analysis in promoters of genes which are bound and regulated by ZFX in a cell type-specific manner to
identify TFs that bind cooperatively with ZFX in the different cell lines. Binding of candidate TFs will be
validated using ChIP-seq. Cell lines with CRISPR-mediated mutations of candidate transcription factor binding
sites will be made, and qRT-PCR experiments will be performed to determine if candidate TF binding affects
ZFX-mediated transcription of cell type-specific genes. My thorough mechanistic characterization in multiple
cell lines of this interesting TF with a unique genomic binding pattern will make significant contributions to the
field of transcription."
10898709,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe morbidity and mortality are commonly associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). Human patients who
survive SCI frequently live with paralysis and extremely reduced quality of life and productivity. SCI often results
in a permanent loss of neurons and the disruption of neural circuits that are critical for normal motor, sensory,
and autonomic function. It is crucial to replenish the lost neurons and reconstruct the broken neural circuits for
functional recovery. Unlike some other tissues or organs in the body, such as skin and liver, which can undergo
self-repair through proliferation of endogenous stem or somatic cells, adult spinal cord exhibits minimal
regenerative capacity. Cellular transplantation of stem cell-derived neural progenitors or differentiated neurons
holds clinical potential 12-18. However, cell therapy is relatively inefficient due to the failure of these cells to
survive or fully adopt a functional phenotype especially under the chronic phase of neural injury. In contrast to
transplantation-based therapy, we propose to employ a novel strategy to reprogram endogenous reactive glial
cells to mature neurons for functional recovery after SCI. Glial cells are abundant and ubiquitously distributed in
the adult spinal cord. They become reactive, proliferate, and form glial scars in response to damage, and play
critical roles in modulating tissue damage and repair after injury. Of note, scar formation and secretion of
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) by reactive glial cells (e.g. astrocytes) are inhibitory for functional
improvement. Attenuating reactive gliosis or reducing CSPG activity improves posttraumatic regeneration,
whereas increasing reactive gliosis worsens brain injuries. Here we hypothesize that reprogramming reactive
glial cells to neurons at the injury site will reduce local glial scar formation and enhance establishment of new
neural circuit resulting in functional recovery. Using a cervical C5 dorsal hemisection model (C5 DH) and forelimb
functional recovery assessments in adult mice, we will test this hypothesis with three specific aims. In Aim 1, we
will determine functional integration of glia-converted neurons after the C5 DH. In Aim 2, we will determine the
anatomical integration of glia-converted neurons into local neural circuitry after the C5 DH. Lastly, in Aim 3, we
will determine functional roles of descending supraspinal and/or propriospinal pathways over induced neurons
in promoting forelimb functional recovery after the C5 DH. The proposed strategy is expected to provide
alternative neuronal subtypes that may facilitate functional recovery after SCI."
10898710,"Corneal neovascularization greatly increases the risk for corneal graft rejection, and thus contributes to
severe vision loss, risk of endophthalmitis, and life-threatening meningitis. It afflicts up to 1.4 million new
patients annually and together with other pathological angiogenesis is the leading cause of blindness in the
United States. Angiogenesis also contributes to diseases that range from cancer to arthritis. A wide range of
protein growth factors (e.g. VEGF, bFGF, PDGF) stimulate angiogenesis, but only VEGF is currently targeted
for antiangiogenic therapy in the eye. CMG2 is an integrin-like transmembrane protein with an extracellular
domain that binds ECM proteins and an intracellular tail without homology to domains of known function. We
find that targeting CMG2 via the protein inhibitor PASSSR, CMG2-binding small molecules, or CMG2 knockout
profoundly inhibits corneal neovascularization, but the mechanism underlying this effect is unknown.
 Angiogenesis requires endothelial cells to migrate towards growth factors. This migration has both a
movement component (motility = chemokinesis) and a directional component (chemotaxis). However, these
components cannot be distinguished using traditional (wound scratch or transwell) assays. Using a microfluidic
migration assay that tracks individual cells over time, we recently discovered that CMG2 targeting completely
disrupts chemotaxis, but not chemokinesis. This effect is observed with multiple growth factors (bFGF, VEGF,
PDGF) and all targeting methods tried thus far (CRISPR knockout, PASSSR, blocking peptide). Thus, we
hypothesize that CMG2 is a key intermediary in a pathway required for growth-factor induced chemotaxis and
efficient angiogenesis. We will test this hypothesis by: 1) identifying intracellular interactions required for
CMG2-mediated chemotaxis; 2) identifying extracellular interactions required for CMG2-mediated chemotaxis
in response to growth factors, and 3) evaluating the contribution of RhoA to CMG2-directed chemotaxis.
 Our working model of CMG2 signaling is based on preliminary data from our lab and others that indicates
that CMG2 localizes near RhoA and several Rho pathway members. Thus, CMG2 is positioned to directly
regulate the cell polarity required for directional migration (chemotaxis). Indeed, we observe that inhibiting
RhoA phenocopies CMG2 inhibition. Finally, we can bypass CMG2 signaling by activating RhoA via the S1P
receptor, so that chemotaxis is no longer sensitive to CMG2 targeting. Thus, RhoA is downstream of CMG2.
 Successful completion of proposed work will identify the mechanism underlying the strong antiangiogenic
effects observed upon CMG2 targeting in vivo and accelerate exploitation of this potential target for broad-
spectrum antiangiogenic therapy. In addition, this work will enable the development of pharmacodynamic
assays to rapidly evaluate drug leads. Finally, key aspects of this proposal are designed to produce possible
therapeutic leads. Drugs arising from these studies could supplement anti-VEGF therapies to treat blindness
caused by ocular neovascularization as well as many other angiogenesis-dependent diseases."
10901141,"Abstract
 Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) is a non-replicative DNA viral vector that is
used in three FDA approved gene therapies and many ongoing clinical trials. Despite the
popularity of rAAV as a therapeutic vehicle, there exists no generalizable method of tightly
controlling rAAV transgene dose. After transduction, most rAAV genomes persist as concatemeric
episomes that are retained over time in non-proliferating cells. Recent evidence suggests that
rAAV episomes are chromatinized and epigenetically regulated, although further inquiry is needed
to clarify the relationship between epigenetic modifications and rAAV transgene expression. The
Hathaway Laboratory has developed a novel, titratable, and reversible system of epigenetic
editing that uses bifunctional small molecules, called Chemical Epigenetic Modifiers (CEMs), to
recruit endogenous epigenetic machinery to targeted genetic loci. We hypothesize that potent
and specific next-generation CEM compounds (SLF* CEMs) could be applied to chemically
regulate rAAV transgene expression. In Aim 1, SLF* CEM-based systems of rAAV regulation will
be constructed and screened for efficacy in human cell lines. In Aim 2, the putative epigenetic
mechanism of CEM-mediated rAAV regulation will be interrogated through knock
down/replacement and CUT&RUN-Sequencing experiments. The results of this study could
provide a foundation for the development of a system of epigenetically tuning the dose of rAAV-
based gene therapies without the need for vector readministration."
10880410,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) Community Outreach and Engagement (COE)
mission is to reduce cancer burden and cancer health disparities in the HICCC Catchment Area (CA). This is
accomplished through outreach, promoting and facilitating research, and engaging community partners in
developing and delivering education, access to services, research, and policy initiatives relevant to the CA. The
CA is remarkably diverse, with higher representation than the US as a whole from individuals who are (1)
Hispanic ethnicity and/or non-white; (2) foreign-born; and (3) living below the poverty line (defined as <$12,140
for an individual and <$25,100 for a four person household). The greatest cancer disparities include the higher
incidence rates of prostate and liver cancer in most of the CA, and the higher rates of prostate, liver, and breast
cancer mortality in the Bronx and Central Harlem. In the Washington Heights/Inwood (WH/I) community where
HICCC is located, the population is 81.4% Hispanic and/or non-white, 46.3% foreign born, and 19.5% living
below the poverty line; screening rates are 87%, 87.9% and 72.1% for mammography, cervical cancer and
colorectal cancer, respectively. These cancer screening rates are all above the US average. HPV vaccination
rates in WH/I are considerably higher than in the US as a whole (72.0% in WH/I versus 48.6% in the US). Higher
screening and vaccination rates in WH/I, a multi-lingual community with a wide range of health literacy, evidences
the successful synergy between research, outreach, education and engagement. With support from the COE
Community Advisory Board (CAB) we focus on areas of greatest relevance to the communities we serve. COE
research and education efforts emphasize individual and community level cancer risk factors and neighborhood
level environmental carcinogens. The COE has four integrated and synergistic aims: (1) Monitor the cancer
burden of the HICCC CA by examining cancer primary prevention, cancer screening, and treatment, including
access to clinical trials, and long-term outcomes after diagnosis; (2) Outreach to ensure the availability and
enhance the accessibility of evidence-based preventive and treatment services throughout the CA; (3) promote
and facilitate relevant and impactful Research in the CA; and (4) Engage communities in the CA to support,
implement, and disseminate community educational, research and policy initiatives. During the last five years,
COE efforts supported the overall HICCC mission by leading community workshops on cancer prevention and
screening, connecting over 20,000 individuals to cancer screening services, enrolling over 8,200 individuals in
the CA into 31 separate studies, and facilitating participation of minority enrollment into clinical trials. COE
continues to monitor the cancer care needs and progress within the HICCC CA to guide program development
and delivery, and to provide evidence-based cancer prevention, screening, and treatment services through
outreach. Guided by the CAB, COE promotes research relevant to the needs of the CA and engages with CA
communities through educational, research, and policy initiatives that benefit the CA and beyond."
10880411,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT: PROJECT SUMMARY
Part I: Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM). The Clinical Protocol and Data Management Office
(CPDM) in the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) comprises 95 FTEs who provide
centralized research support services to more than 50 HICCC members. These services include comprehensive
regulatory support from protocol inception to activation. The CPDM is a unique entity at Columbia University
Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH). The CPDM also supports accruals
to clinical trials, inclusive of all sponsor types, by providing centralized cores of trained clinical research nurses,
clinical research coordinators and data managers to HICCC members. Research coordination and protocol
compliance are enhanced through fostering a strong member-CPDM interaction, collaboration, and teamwork.
As the central data repository of all oncology-related trial activities, the CPDM provides comprehensive reports
and performance metrics to the HICCC senior leadership team (SLT) for proper oversight and strategic planning,
including training and education initiatives (with the Cancer Research Career Enhancement or CRCE Core). The
CPDM also ensures compliance with NCI’s Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov
reporting requirements. In 2018 alone, the CPDM reported the recruitment of 6,262 individuals into all clinical
research studies being conducted within the HICCC (710 interventional and 5,552 non-interventional accruals)
and has facilitated the activation of more than 137 studies.
Part II: Data and Safety Monitoring (DSM). DSM is required for all interventional studies. For the HICCC
member-sponsored studies, the HICCC has established its own DSM Committee (DSMC), which performs risk-
based monitoring to ensure the highest level of patient safety and data integrity. Effective quality control functions
are also instituted as outlined in the HICCC’s NCI-approved DSM plan to ensure protocol compliance. In 2018,
the DSMC monitored 58 studies, including the review of 120 progress reports, and 134 serious adverse events.
Part III: Inclusion of Women and Minorities in Research. The HICCC maintains and supports multiple,
proactive efforts to promote the recruitment of women and underrepresented minorities. In 2018, among the 710
individuals enrolled onto interventional studies, 64% were women and 48% represented ethnic and racial
underrepresented minorities.
Part IV: Inclusion Across the Lifespan in Research. The HICCC supports the NIH policy on the inclusion
across the lifespan in research. The HICCC is an active member of the NCTN Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
and other pediatric clinical trial networks. The HICCC is also active in NCI Adolescent and Young Adult initiatives
and is a leading participant in the NCI Early Onset Malignancy Initiative. Enrollment of children and older adults
are not restricted as long as criteria for eligibility are met. This can be demonstrated by interventional trial accrual
of 6% of individuals age 18 and under and 33% of individuals age 65 and older."

10880424,"Abstract
Blood transfusions remain an important treatment modality for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and
thalassemia (Thal). However, 15-50% of these patients develop alloantibodies causing complications ranging
from difficulty in finding matched units to potentially life-threatening delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions
(DHTR). Increasing evidence suggest that free hemoglobin (Hb) and heme play central roles in many aspects
of the pathophysiology of hemolytic anemias, especially in SCD. With regards to alloimmunization, we have
previously identified weakened innate immunoregulatory function in response to free heme in alloimmunized
SCD patients with the implication that hemolysis is a potential alloimmunization risk factor. Our preliminary data
indicate that free heme can directly inhibit B plasma B cell differentiation in healthy donors and non-
alloimmunized but not alloimmunized SCD patients. Heme/hemolysis resulted in enhancement of T follicular
regulatory cell (TFR) suppressive activity, key in inhibiting B cell responses, in non-alloimmunized but not
alloimmunized SCD patients. We therefore posit that defective response to heme/hemolysis in B cells and TFR
cell increases their risk of alloimmunization. We hypothesize that heme-sensing pathways in key humoral
immune cells are critical in the regulation of SCD RBC alloimmunization. We will test our hypothesis by examining
key DOCK8/HO-1/ROS heme molecular pathways at basal level and during RBC transfusion in B cells (Aim1)
and TFR cells (Aim2) in patients with SCD. Using both in vitro and in vivo models, we will also test the efficacy of
drugs that target these pathways to switch off humoral immune response against transfused RBCs under
hemolytic conditions. We believe that elucidation of molecular pathways associated with the defective heme
response in humoral immune cells in alloimmunized patients is likely to lead to identification of potential
biomarkers of alloimmunization and DHTR in hemolytic disorders and novel therapeutic targets that can prevent
or even inhibit alloimmunization/DHTR."

SCD exhibits increased susceptibility to infection which in turn leads to SCD-specific pathophysiological sequelae.
Infection is the leading cause of death in these patients especially in less developed countries where the blood supply is not
efficiently screened. Even in the US, transfusion transmitted pathogens can represent a major threat of morbidity and
mortality to SCD recipients. EVs are produced by pathogens and host cells in response to infection and carry serve as
vehicles for dissimilation of effector molecules in the infected host. Hemolysis and anemia are two common symptoms that
accompany many infectious diseases. While particularly true of parasitic diseases that target red cells, like malaria and
babesia, these complications are also seen in many other infections. While the current proposal focuses on babesia, a single
pathogen, we believe that the impact of pathogen derived EVs on host cells is a common theme in the pathogenesis of many
infectious diseases and results from this study can have implications for hemolytic complications caused by other infectious
agents. Hemolytic complications in SCD are the major contributing pathology to fatalities seen in these transfusion
transmissions, making it imperative to elucidate the reason for the higher degree of hemolysis seen in these infected patients.
EVs derived from parasitized cells can alter cell membranes, impact gene expression and modulate signaling pathways to
promote hemolysis. Our overall goal is to define mechanisms of extracellular vesicle driven hemolysis during infection in
SCD, using Babesia as our model. Hypothesis: Babesia anemia is exaggerated in SCD because EVs accelerate a)
bystander RBC destruction and b) exacerbate ineffective erythropoiesis due to the increased susceptibility of SCD to 1)
EV-mediated alterations and complement opsonization of bystander RBCs resulting in direct /indirect lysis 2) immune
activation by EVs resulting in increased phagocytosis and induction of autoAbs 3) EV mediated inhibition of enucleation
of erythroid progenitors in SCD BM erythropoiesis. To gain insight into these molecular and cellular processes, using in
vivo and in vitro SCD infection models, we will: 1) Elucidate mechanisms by which EV Uptake mediates direct hemolysis
by examining EV mediated alterations in membranes of SCD RBCs that cause hemolysis 2) Elucidate mechanisms of EV
modulation of extravascular hemolysis by examining macrophage polarization and TLR signaling pathway activation,
assessing the role and mechanism of autoAb induction by EVs and determining the contribution of autoantibody
opsonization and/or complement fixation in bystander RBC clearance 3) Elucidate mechanisms by which EV Uptake
contributes to dyserythropoiesis by defining the underlying molecular mechanisms for both EV-induced and infection-
induced enucleation defects in erythroid progenitor cells in SCD bone marrow. Our proposed studies will result in a better
understanding of the role of parasite EVs in the pathogenesis associated with human babesiosis especially the hyper-
hemolysis seen in the sickle cell context. We anticipate these studies will lead to the refinement of diagnostic tools and offer
novel strategies to combat anemia in human babesiosis."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a major healthcare burden with limited treatment options. Currently available
treatments are limited to transfusions, hydroxyurea and L-glutamine. With increasing interest in hematopoietic
stem cell (HSC) transplantation and gene therapy as treatment options for SCD, understanding how hemolytic
stress alters the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment is critical for the development of appropriate therapeutic
strategies. In Aim 1, we will investigate the effects of hemolysis on the BM niches including mesenchymal stem
cells (MSCs), responsible for maintaining HSCs, and erythroblastic islands (EBIs), the niche for erythropoiesis.
In Aim 2, we will define the mechanisms for the effects of hemolysis on erythroid progenitors/precursors. We
further propose to determine whether therapy with transfusion, heme scavenger hemopexin or the combination
can improve the function of MSCs and EBI macrophages. Our overall hypothesis is that free heme leads to
dysfunction of the BM hematopoietic niche and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which can be alleviated in
part by hemopexin and/or transfusion therapy. First, we will investigate the effects of hemolysis on the BM MSC
ability to regulate hematopoiesis. We will evaluate numerous MSC stem cell properties and investigate how
alterations may in turn affect HSC activation state, accumulation of ROS and DNA damage. Next, we will define
the mechanisms for the impaired erythropoietic activity due to hemolysis, including mechanisms for defective
EBIs formation, CFU-E colony formation and enucleation. These studies are enabled by the SCD mouse model,
Thal mouse model, Epor-eGFP knockin mouse model, mouse models targeting BM MSCs, our recent
identification of Epor+ EBI macrophages, validation of both anti-mouse Epor and anti-human EPOR antibodies
as well as the methods we have developed to purify erythroid cells at distinct developmental stage and to quantify
both murine and human BM terminal erythroid differentiation. These studies will provide a comprehensive
mechanistic understanding of the effects of hemolysis on BM hematopoietic niches, and contribute to the
development of novel therapeutics targeting the BM niche cells and ultimately improve treatment options for
patients with SCD."

Hemolytic diseases, including sickle cell disease (SCD) and β-thalassemia (THAL), are generally hallmarked
by hemolysis and chronic inflammation. The mechanism underlying the different extent of inflammation in
these diseases is unknown (SCD>THAL). Our published findings revealed that, besides promoting vascular
endothelium activation, free heme triggers a M1-like pro-inflammatory phenotypic switching of reticulo-
endothelial macrophages which alters their functional properties. Recently, we observed that the exposure to
intact red blood cells (RBCs), and therefore erythrophagocytosis, induces a M2-like anti-inflammatory
macrophage phenotype. This led us to hypothesize that the differential degree of inflammation between SCD
and THAL is determined by the type of hemolysis, either intra-vascular (SCD) or extra-vascular (THAL), with
different effects on macrophage functions. In Aim 1 we will address the concept that whereas in SCD
inflammation is triggered by heme-induced M1-like macrophages, in THAL it is in part ‘blunted’ by
erythrophagocytosis-induced M2-like macrophages. We believe that this mechanism similarly underlies the
anti-inflammatory effect of fresh RBC transfusions and the detrimental effect of old RBC transfusions in SCD
through the exposure of macrophages to heme in intact RBCs or in free form, respectively. To test this
hypothesis we will take advantage of mouse models of intra- and extra-vascular hemolysis and compare SCD
and THAL mice, as well as analyze another hemolytic condition, Babesia infection, and study the differential
phenotypic switching of tissue macrophages induced by these events on macrophage activation and
inflammation. Finally, we will interrogate cell metabolome, with the hypothesis that free heme promotes M1
polarization via TRAF6/NF-kB and/or Akt/mTORC1/HIF1α-triggered glycolytic switching. We further posit that
this mechanism has relevance for acute chest syndrome (ACS), a main cause of morbidity and mortality in
SCD. In Aim 2 we will address the central hypothesis that by mediating lung macrophage inflammatory
phenotypic switching, heme promotes ACS and exacerbates symptoms in response to infections and fat
emboli. To address this, we plan to assess the contribution of heme-induced M1 macrophages to ACS
pathophysiology in SCD mice and validate the findings in SCD patients under steady-state and ACS condition
by analyzing sputum macrophage polarization/function with plasma/sputum heme and cytokines levels and
studying the functional alterations induced by free heme exposure in sputum macrophages of steady-state
SCD patients. Finally, we will test whether transfusions, metabolic modulators and adoptive transfer of
macrophages with increased iron export ability and anti-inflammatory/anti-hemolytic therapies can mitigate
ACS, by triggering or reprogramming macrophages towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Our translational
study is expected to (i) shed light on the mode of action of heme as lung stressor in ACS, with a focus on the
newly observed heme-activated macrophages; (ii) improve transfusion practice in SCD and THAL and
understand its beneficial effect in ACS; (iii) identify new targets and test strategies to implement the current
therapeutic options. Our goal is to propose novel targeted therapies for chronic inflammation and ACS based
on the modulation of macrophage polarization."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic, relapsing brain disorder. It is well established that stress
motivates alcohol use and triggers relapse in individuals with AUD; however, the neural mechanisms that
underlie this association are not clear. Preclinical studies have shown that chronic alcohol and chronic stress
impact the brain’s stress systems in a way that results in deficits in flexible, adaptive stress coping. These deficits
can perpetuate a cycle of enduring stress conditions, and ultimately drive progression of AUD. The vast majority
of the literature examining chronic stress and its effects on brain function in AUD has yet to be translated from
preclinical to human clinical samples. Furthermore, clinical studies examining chronic stress and its association
with brain function in AUD are limited by the nature and quality of chronic stress measures, which primarily rely
on self-report questionnaires. To advance the translational impact of the science of the stress neurocircuitry in
AUD, it is critical that clinical studies implement methods to objectively measure chronic stress. This F32 NRSA
will objectively assess chronic stress and examine dynamic functional connectivity within the brain’s stress
coping system, using fMRI, in a clinical sample with AUD (n=32) and matched controls (n=32). Additionally, this
F32 will foster the applicant’s development as independent clinical and translational neuroscientist with a focus
on the intersection of stress and AUD. This application will draw on resources from the Sponsors’ (Drs. Lara Ray
and Erica Grodin) R21 study investigating the effect of stress on decision-making in AUD by adding
complimentary, non-overlapping scientific aims and outcome measures. The UCLA Life Stress Interview will be
used to objectively assess the psychological experience of chronic stress. Resting state fMRI will be used to
examine dynamic functional connectivity within the brain’s stress coping network. The ventromedial prefrontal
cortex (vmPFC) is recognized as a key locus in a resilient stress coping network, and recent studies have
suggested that dynamic changes in vmPFC activation during acute stress signals resilient coping. The applicant
will extend this work by measuring dynamic vmPFC functional connectivity to characterize temporal variability
within the network. The applicant will integrate these psychological and neural levels of analysis to examine the
effects of chronic stress on temporal variability, or flexibility, within the brain’s stress coping system in AUD
versus controls. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that individuals with AUD will exhibit greater chronic stress compared
with controls. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that individuals with AUD will exhibit diminished temporal variability
(flexibility) in vmPFC resting state functional connectivity compared with controls. Aim 3 tests the hypothesis that
chronic stress will be associated with decreased flexibility in vmPFC resting state functional connectivity, and
that AUD will moderate this relationship. The proposed study represents important steps in: 1) translating
preclinical science on the stress neurocircuitry in AUD; and 2) the applicant’s scientific development and maturity
as an independent clinical alcohol researcher with an interest in the role of stress in AUD."

 The antiparkinson drug levodopa (L-DOPA) is the current standard of treatment for Parkinson’s Disease
(PD) and can be used as either a monotherapy or in combination with monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors,
such as selegiline to ameliorate dopamine depletion. Despite L-DOPA’s recognition as the gold standard for PD
management, our group has recently made a fundamental observation of iron accumulation in the substantia
nigra (SN) of PD patients following L-DOPA but not selegiline administration. These findings indicate that the
type of antiparkinson drug may be correlated with nigral iron increase. Evidence suggests that nigral iron
accumulation is increased in PD patients, decreasing dopamine thus exacerbating the progression of
neurodegeneration. Though, it remains unclear whether increased iron in the SN is from PD itself or from L-
DOPA treatment.
 My objective for this proposal is to demonstrate that L-DOPA exposure alters the iron status through
direct effects on dysregulation at the BBB (Aim 1) and/or through altering the molecular and cellular profile in the
SN (Aim 2). Aim 1 of this project will elucidate how L-DOPA exposure will cause an increase in iron transport
from the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to the brain in an in vitro BBB model. I will measure iron transport in endothelial
cells after drug administration. Aim 2 will examine how L-DOPA delivered orally will impact the molecular,
histological landscape, and iron metabolism in the ventral midbrain. Furthermore, Aim 2 will take a unique
perspective to study how iron deficiency alters brain iron and exacerbate the severity of iron accumulation in a
rat model by examining brain iron levels and immunohistological staining expressions. PD patients have a high
prevalence of an anemic diagnosis, however, there is minimal research regarding the effects of L-DOPA and
anemia on brain iron homeostasis. This research project will deepen our understanding of how antiparkinson
treatments such as L-DOPA and selegiline impact iron homeostasis with the hopes of identifying iron-based
mechanisms from the treatment. Importantly, advances in iron supplements will provide novel therapeutic targets
to improve our standard of care for PD patients
 The proposed training plan is sponsored by Dr. James Connor. The overall goal of the training plan is to
provide the fellowship applicant with a solid foundation for a successful career as a researcher and enhance
techniques for translational studies. The goals included in the training plan are 1.) Gain experience and
competence in various techniques integrating iron biology and neuroscience, 2.) collaborate with other research
scientists to learn and complement my knowledge, 3.) develop hypothesis-driven research, 4.) conduct
translational research, and 5.) effectively present data in a manuscript."

Parenting plays a crucial role in youth development, influencing a myriad of health behaviors. As a result,
parenting is a common focus of interventions aimed at improving youth health outcomes. Effective parenting
interventions and their study necessitate robust assessments of parenting. However, the state of the evidence
for psychometric properties of existing parenting assessments is weak. The Multidimensional Assessment of
Parenting Scale (MAPS) is a measure of parenting exhibiting strong psychometric properties. However, the
utility of the MAPS remains limited by the omission of certain parenting dimensions, as indicated by preliminary
studies. Other limitations impeding progress in measuring parenting include: 1) underutilization of qualitative
methods, 2) the need for multi-informant reports (e.g., youth or coparent), 3) the absence of validated
ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) of parenting, 4) limited use of advanced psychometric methods,
and 5) underrepresentation of ethnoracially minoritized and non-English speaking parents, as well as fathers,
in parenting research and theories. Further, preliminary data from my current R36 project show that the MAPS
can be enhanced through revisions informed by mixed methods, which resulted in better measurement quality
indices and measurement equivalence of the MAPS by parent ethnoracial identities. Therefore, in this project, I
propose introducing multiple innovations to optimize the MAPS. Aim 1 involves conducting qualitative
interviews with parents and experts, followed by qualitative and text mining analyses of interview data, to
inform revisions to the MAPS and identify unmeasured parenting domains, which will yield the MAPS-S for
self-report. Aim 2 will focus on developing and field testing the MAPS-S for coparent (MAPS-C) and youth
(MAPS-Y) report through cognitive interviews and national surveys. The objective is to examine factor
structures, reliability, and measurement equivalence in two independent samples to ensure the replication of
strong psychometric properties. In Aim 2, Spanish measures will be piloted in an additional national sample.
Aim 3 employs item response theory to develop an optimal EMA MAPS, which will be tested with parents and
youth dyads. Across all aims, I will examine relations between MAPS subscales, MAPS agreement,
discrepancy, and youth health outcomes to establish convergent validity. This project is innovative in its use of
novel approaches, including iterative, multimethod, multi-informant, EMA, and data-informed methods, to
develop and validate novel parenting scales. By involving parents from ethnoracially diverse and Spanish
speaking parents, including fathers, we will be able to accurately determine when and how to intervene and
prevent negative or ineffective parenting in diverse families. The assessments emerging from this study can be
clinically employed to screen, target, and monitor negative or ineffective parenting in interventions and
prevention programs with families from diverse backgrounds. Ultimately, this project will contribute to the
advancement of parenting research and interventions aimed at improving youth health outcomes more broadly."

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis is the leading cause of corneal ulcers and infection-associated blindness in
the United States. The existing antiviral therapies for the topical management of ocular herpes infections include
nucleoside analogs such as ganciclovir and trifluridine which need to be administered 5-8 times a day to control
the infection. Hence, current topical therapies have patient adherence issues which impact therapeutic
outcomes. In addition to the limited topical bioavailability, the emergence of drug resistance to acyclic
nucleosides has necessitated the development of long-acting antiviral therapies for the topical treatment of ocular
herpes infections. Our preliminary data show that adefovir dipivoxil (ADV), an off-patent, FDA-approved hepatitis
B virus DNA polymerase inhibitor, is well tolerated by the human corneal epithelial cells and is significantly more
active against HSV-1 and HSV-2 when compared to acyclovir, other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates such as
tenofovir, cidofovir, and their prodrugs. Our preliminary data further showed that thrice daily topical administration
of 1% ADV solution has a robust antiviral effect in a murine ocular herpes model compared to once daily 1%
ADV solution and thrice daily 0.15% ADV solution. Thus, strategies are needed to reduce the dosing frequency
of ADV to further improve ocular herpes therapy and patient compliance. We previously demonstrated that
hydrophilic ionizable antibiotics such as moxifloxacin can be converted to hydrophobic moxifloxacin salt and its
subsequent formulation into a mucoinert nanosuspension augmented the topical delivery and reduced the
administration frequency. Here, we extend this approach to improve ocular delivery of hydrophilic ionizable
antiviral drug, ADV. We hypothesize that the development of hydrophobic salts of ADV and their transformation
into mucoinert nanosuspensions (NS) will improve ocular delivery and prolong the release of ADV with a
concomitant reduction in dosing frequency. Aim 1 will focus on the evaluation of ADV solution compared to
currently approved topical anti-herpetic drugs, ganciclovir, and trifluridine using ex-vivo ocular permeability
studies, ocular PK in rabbits, and in vivo efficacy in a mouse model of ocular herpes. Aim 2 will focus on the
development and characterization of NS of various ADV hydrophobic salts followed by evaluation of their in vitro
cytocompatibility, in vitro antiviral activity, ex vivo corneal permeability, ocular PK in rabbits and in vivo efficacy
in a rabbit model of ocular herpes. We have already generated NS of ADV pamoate, a hydrophobic salt of ADV.
Our preliminary data show that once-daily topical ADV pamoate NS was significantly more effective than once
daily 1% ADV solution but equally effective as thrice daily 1% ADV solution in a murine model of ocular herpes
infection. We will evaluate selected nanoformulations of ADV hydrophobic salt in the rabbit model of ocular
herpes infection. Finally, we will evaluate the long-term safety of ADV solution and ADV nanoformulation in
rabbits. The successful completion of this project will lead to the development of clinically viable, patient-friendly
long-acting topical nanomedicine for the effective management of ocular herpes infections."

Humans live in a complex and dynamic environment. In our daily lives, many decisions depend on contextual
information. For example, when drivers enter a two-way street in the US, they will stay on the right side of the
road. Once they travel to the UK (a different context), they will have to adjust their actions and drive on the left
side to follow local traffic rules. This capacity for flexible decision making is thought to be a critical part of cognitive
function and is compromised in psychiatric and neurological disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). How does a healthy brain
process contextual information and flexibly modulate the behavioral response? How is this neural computation
altered in patients with cognitive inflexibility? Neuroimaging studies in humans have indicated that the frontal
lobe is responsible for this executive function; however, mechanistic studies in animal models have shown mixed
results. Our lab takes advantage of the rapidly developing genetic and imaging tools available in mouse models
to study the neural mechanism underlying context-dependent decision making. We have recently discovered
that the premotor cortex (anterior lateral motor cortex, ALM) encodes both contextual cues and behavioral
choices using an olfactory-guided delayed match to sample (DMS) task. More importantly, neural processing in
the ALM (but not orbitofrontal cortex) is required for animals to optimally perform this task. In this proposal, I aim
to unravel the neural mechanism and computation underlying flexible decision making at both the subcellular
and network levels.
I first aim to develop a new context-dependent olfactory decision (CDOD) task to address a potential confounder
in our previous work and establish a robust and simple behavioral paradigm to study flexible decision in mouse
models. Next, I will elucidate whether and how the context selective neurons in the ALM, including pyramidal
neurons and subtypes of interneurons, mediate the flexible response in choice neurons by using 2-photon
imaging, targeted 3D photostimulation, and computational modeling. I hypothesize that the context selective
neurons in the ALM mediate the functional state of the choice neurons through dendritic gating to regulate the
flexible behavioral response. Furthermore, I will test the causal role of context specific neurons in decisions using
large-scale 3D photoinhibition. Lastly, I aim to identify the upstream brain substrates that enable the processing
of context information in ALM.
Answering these questions will contribute to the core goal of NIMH by advancing our knowledge about the neural
mechanism behind flexible decision-making, which is altered in mental illnesses such as ASD and OCD. Using
the proposed experiments in the olfactory system as an entry point, I hope to provide insights into the
fundamental cognitive functions involving perception and decision-making."
10902956,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Social interaction is essential to the cognitive development and wellbeing of many species including
humans. Social withdrawal is an early risk factor and predictor of mental illness onset and often begins during
adolescence. Adolescence is a period of increased plasticity during which environmental input and brain activity
guide circuitry maturation, including thalamo-prefrontal circuitry. Adolescent social interaction is necessary for
the establishment of adult cognitive behaviors, which rely on the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our lab has previously
shown that adolescent inhibition of the medial thalamus (mTH) impairs PFC maturation and development of adult
cognitive flexibility in mice. I have observed that adolescent social isolation (ASI) impairs cognitive flexibility
selectively in females, who have been traditionally understudied in this field. Therefore, I hypothesize that ASI
induces cognitive impairments by reducing adolescent mTH activity and thalamo-prefrontal connectivity in a
sexually dimorphic manner. Furthermore, I have observed that some ASI-treated individuals do not show deficits
in cognitive flexibility. Indeed, many studies of ASI and other stressful paradigms have reported large variability
in behavioral adaptations, but little work has been done to uncover the underlying mechanisms of this variation.
I hypothesize that variation in the level of mTh activity and connectivity deficits will explain behavioral variation,
with higher activity and connectivity conferring resilience to ASI-induced cognitive deficits. With this in mind, I
have designed my study with the statistical power to detect sex differences and resilience.
 I propose two periods for intervention to rescue and prevent ASI-induced cognitive deficits. Our lab has
shown that excitation of the mTH in adulthood transiently rescues cognitive flexibility in mice who underwent
adolescent mTH inhibition. Similarly, I hypothesize that excitation of the mTH during a task requiring cognitive
flexibility will rescue ASI-induced cognitive deficits. Based on the necessity of adolescent mTH activity for proper
PFC maturation, and the role of thalamo-prefrontal circuitry in adult cognitive flexibility, I hypothesize that
adolescent thalamic excitation during social isolation will prevent formation of long-term cognitive deficits. I will
excite all PFC-projecting neurons in a similar manner. To test these hypotheses, I will be trained in and employ
a combination of, optogenetics, chemogenetics transgenic mouse lines, and targeted viral strategies.
Additionally, I will be trained on machine learning tools for histology registration and segmentation, decoding and
clustering of cell distribution patterns, and unbiased behavioral scoring.
 The identification of an early critical period of socially guided brain development may provide a window
for intervention to prevent or slow development of cognitive symptoms in adolescence. If proven, my hypotheses
point to adolescents as an ideal target for interventions aimed to increase social connectedness in individuals at
high risk of developing schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Studying both male and female brains will
ensure that individuals of both sexes can benefit from scientifically informed intervention and treatment."

Lynch Syndrome (LS) is the most common cause of hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) affecting >1 million
Americans. LS is caused by germline mutations in one of four DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes. Normal
colorectal epithelial cells in LS patients become MMR deficient after a somatic ‘second’ hit generating the accu-
mulation of hundreds of insertion-deletion mutations (indels) in microsatellite sequences. These indels generate
frameshift peptides (FSP) that become neoantigens (neoAg) and stimulate the adaptive immune system. We
have previously reported that adaptive immune genes are highly expressed in LS pre-cancers, and we have
generated a detailed neoAg catalog with >1,000 FSP neoAg from a cohort of LS pre-cancers and early-stage
CRCs using next-generation sequencing tools coupled with a state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipeline. In addition,
we have published the results of a phase Ib chemoprevention clinical trial in LS patients using naproxen showing
immune-activation of colorectal mucosa resident cells. Taken together, these results point strongly towards the
development of a vaccine for ‘recurrent’ and ‘shared’ LS-associated tumor neoAg combined with naproxen for
pan-cancer prevention in the LS population. However, the main knowledge gap remains to select the most opti-
mal neoAg peptides and to establish the efficacy and safety of the vaccination in a reliable animal model that
allows immediate human translation. Rhesus macaques are a promising non-human primate (NHP) model dis-
playing the closest genomic resemblance to humans. Our research team has reported the first colony of spon-
taneous LS in rhesus carrying a germline mutation in MLH1. In addition, we are partnering with industry collab-
orators in AMAL Therapeutics that have developed an innovative vaccination platform called KISIMA, integrating
several selected FSP in tandem with a cell-permeable peptide fostering cell penetration, and a toll-like receptor
agonist that acts as a self-adjuvant. Our central hypothesis is that our state-of-the-art bioinformatics pipeline
for neoAg prediction will lead to the identification of the most immunogenic, recurrent across tumors, and shared
among LS-associated tumor types FSP neoAg to be integrated in the KISIMA self-adjuvant vaccine platform,
which will render a strong immunogenicity in combination with naproxen. To explore this hypothesis, we propose
three specific aims: 1. To validate in vitro the immunogenicity of the top 150 recurrent neoAg shared by LS
non-colorectal tumors using ELISpot, ELISA, and cytokine assays using PBMCs and CD8+ T cells from healthy
human donors; 2. To develop artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) expressing human LS neoAg to validate
the cytotoxicity of neoAg-enriched T cells; and 3. To assess the immunogenicity of a neoAg combination using
the novel self-adjuvant vaccine platform KISIMA alone and in combination with naproxen in a co-clinical trial in
LS rhesus. The proposal is highly innovative because is developing a novel self-adjuavnt vaccine platform in a
unique spontaneous NHP model of LS. The proposed research will significantly impact the field because it is a
stepping stone to develop a Phase I first-in-human clinical trial to test a novel CRC vaccine for LS patients."

Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is a rare subset accounting for <1% of all breast cancers. However, MpBC is
a significant health challenge as it exhibits the most dismal prognosis of all breast cancers, even worse than
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), with a survival rate of 8 months or less in patients with metastatic disease.
Due to a lack of druggable targets, the main therapeutic option for metastatic MpBC remains systemic
chemotherapy, despite known resistance to most cytotoxic drugs. One common molecular alteration in MpBC is
hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway. Additionally, we
recently published that MpBC displays a gain-of-function oncogenic mutation in ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39),
which is responsible for treatment resistance, stem cell self-renewal, and lung metastasis. The mechanistic
function of RPL39 is mediated through inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated nitric oxide production.
In addition, we demonstrated in a completed clinical trial that inhibiting this nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway
using pan-NOS inhibitor NG-methyl-L-arginine acetate (L-NMMA) may represent a highly effective therapeutic
option for TNBC patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that a combinatorial targeted approach of inhibiting
the two major oncogenic pathways implicated in MpBC, PI3K/AKT and NOS, would lead to significant
tumor regression. To test this hypothesis, this U01 application brings together research teams from Houston
Methodist Cancer Center (HMCC), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the National
Cancer Institute (NCI). Specific Aim 1 seeks to define whether dual inhibition of PI3K/AKT using alpelisib and
NOS inhibition using L-NMMA combined with nab-paclitaxel will increase the objective response rate and survival
in metastatic MpBC patients. In Specific Aim 2, using blood and core biopsy tissues collected in the trial, we will
identify mechanisms of response to therapy to determine the efficacy of the targeted PI3K/AKT and NOS
pathway inhibitory approach. Furthermore, the cell-cell interactions among tumor cells, myeloid cells, lymphoid
cells, and stromal cells within the tumor microenvironment and their role in supporting cancer stem cell
populations and drug-resistant cell development during treatment will be evaluated. The impact of distinct cellular
localization patterns within the tumor ecosystem on the process of cancer stem cell maintenance and modulation,
as well as the development of drug resistance, will be analyzed at the single-cell level using spatial
transcriptomics, immunofluorescence, CyTOF imaging systems, and a multi-modal data analysis model. This
study thus proposes a mechanistic investigation of a combinatorial targeted approach against the two key
pathways in MpBC, develops unique crosstalk models, and identifies biomarkers of resistance and cell–cell
interactions using specimens derived from MpBC patients."

 The optic nerve head (ONH) is the primary site of axon injury in glaucoma, a neurodegenerative disease
that is the leading cause of irreversible blindness affecting 76 million people worldwide. Elevated intraocular
pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, and lowering IOP is the only available strategy to
slow the progression of vision loss. Thus, there is a critical need for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the
site of axon injury within the ONH. In order to develop novel ONH-targeted treatments for glaucoma, we must
determine the early cellular events that lead to ONH axon injury. Astrocytes (local glia within the ONH) provide
structural and metabolic support for axons. In neurodegenerative disorders including glaucoma, astrocytes
become “reactive” and display structural and molecular changes. In several glaucoma models, including ours,
significant ONH astrocyte actin- and intermediate filament-based cytoskeletal reactivity occurs prior to
observable axon injury. Whether IOP-dependent ONH astrocyte reactivity is neuroprotective or helping drive
disease, or whether modulation of these reactive responses alters axon vulnerability to elevated IOP remain
unclear. Using a rodent model of acute IOP elevation, our preliminary data demonstrate that ONH astrocytes
react by retracting their actin-based cellular extensions and reducing connexin43 labeling (an astrocyte gap
junction protein involved in maintaining astrocyte syncytial isopotentiality, and reliant on the actin cytoskeleton
for localization). Furthermore, we show that actin cytoskeletal stabilization (using the Rho kinase inhibitor
fasudil) significantly reduces ONH astrocyte cytoskeletal & gap junction reactivity and protects axons in this
model. Lastly, using an in vivo surgical strategy developed in our lab, we show that ONH astrocytes can be
modulated by local small molecule delivery to the ONH. In this proposal, we will determine the role of ONH
astrocyte cytoskeletal reactivity in axon degeneration after acute IOP elevation, by combining our rodent model
with local and systemic delivery of small molecule modulators of the cytoskeleton. Next, we will examine the
mechanistic role of ONH astrocytic connexin43 in IOP-dependent axon degeneration using small molecule and
genetic strategies to suppress connexin43 in our rodent models. Axon- and astrocyte-specific
immunofluorescence of ONH tissue will be used to determine the extent of axon injury and astrocyte
responses within the ONH at various time points after IOP elevation. In the course of this work, we will address
the role of the ONH astrocyte cytoskeleton and gap junctions in IOP-dependent axon degeneration, as well as
their modulation as a novel strategy for axon protection. The ultimate long-term goal of this project is to bring to
light new astrocyte-specific therapeutic targets to reduce the burden of glaucomatous vision loss worldwide."

convene a diverse group of participants to set the agenda for the 2025 Symposium as well as broader action
steps for TWH educational offerings. The three-and-a-half-day hybrid Symposium will include a mix of sessions
and preparatory workshops emphasizing the latest TWH science and practice. Our goal is to support prior and
current NIOSH TWH initiatives, as well as national and global demands to protect and enhance the health of all
workers. We have three main goals:
 1. Identify and share the most compelling research, education, and interventions that advance worker
 safety, health, and well-being,
 2. Build collaborations between different stakeholders (e.g., researchers, educators, employers,
 government agencies, business professionals, public health professionals, and others), and
 3. Disseminate findings to advance TWH research, education and practice that address existing and
 emerging issues facing workplaces and workers globally.
The overall aim of the Symposium is to enhance both the work environment as well as prevention efforts that
advance worker well-being through research, education, and practice. These events will significantly contribute
to advancing national goals set by NIOSH to reduce injuries and illnesses through enhancing training and
professional development in TWH. It will do this by better understanding workplace interventions, research
methodologies, and applied TWH practices. The planning committee will address diversity and inclusion as
priority areas for submissions, keynote speakers, and the overall program. We will include strong research to
practice (r2p) emphasis, as well as the advancement of a TWH research agenda, that aligns with the NIOSH
National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) goals, in particular those cross-sector goals relevant to the
NIOSH FY2019-2026 strategic plan.
Short term outcomes will include general satisfaction with the Symposium, including the quality and relevance
of sessions and perceived changes in knowledge and abilities as a result of attendance. Intermediate outcomes
will include increased engagement and new collaborations that develop because of attending the conference.
The key long-term outcome is to increase the capacity and collaboration of researchers and practitioners focused
on TWH studies and interventions to improve the effectiveness and sustainability of TWH implementation."
10906033,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by
impairments in social skills, verbal and nonverbal communication, and repetitive behaviors. ASD is highly
prevalent, affecting up to 1 in 44 children in the United States and has been studied for decades, yet the
underlying neural mechanisms that lead to the disorder are poorly understood. No biological tests to diagnose
ASD earlier nor treatments targeting the core symptoms of ASD are available. Identification and functional
analyses of high-confidence ASD risk genes are beginning to uncover convergent pathways by which genes with
diverse functions lead to ASD. De novo mutations in Chromodomain Helicase DNA Binding Protein 8 (CHD8)
are among the most strongly associated with ASD. CHD8 encodes a chromatin modifier that affects cell cycle
progression through its role in gene expression regulation. Cell cycle control affects the timing of neural
progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation and differentiation into neurons, which lays the foundation for proper
neurodevelopment. Although numerous studies to date have improved our insight into CHD8 function, there are
still critical gaps in our understanding of how CHD8 mutation alters cell cycle progression and neural proliferation,
when these alterations take place, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes.
 To address these gaps, I will use a zebrafish line with a loss-of-function mutation in chd8. Zebrafish provide
key advantages for studying early neurodevelopment processes in ways not feasible with mouse or in vitro
models. Neural proliferation and migration take place from ~14 to 96 hours post-fertilization (hpf), providing easy
access to embryonic timepoints that are difficult to study in mice. This vertebrate system will allow us to directly
study fundamental neurodevelopmental processes at cellular, transcriptional, and circuit levels at critical time
points, which is essential for understanding the function of CHD8 in shaping the developing brain. Based on my
preliminary data, I hypothesize that CHD8 mutation causes decreased expression of proteins involved in
translation initiation and cell cycle phase transitions, resulting in altered cell cycle timing and neural proliferation
and differentiation, which may ultimately affect synaptogenesis and circuit formation. Aim 1 will investigate how
and when mutations in CHD8 affect cell cycle timing and the balance of NPC proliferation and differentiation
across early vertebrate neurodevelopment in vivo. Aim 2 will investigate the mechanisms underlying changes in
cell cycle progression by investigating the impact of CHD8 mutations on protein synthesis.
 Together, my research will use rigorous multi-level approaches to elucidate the role of CHD8 in
neurodevelopmental cell cycle regulation and protein synthesis, which will advance our understanding of ASD
neurobiology. In addition to learning technical approaches in a powerful model system that will provide me with
rigorous scientific training, my training plan affords me numerous growth opportunities with the support of superb
mentors to pursue my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist."

This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) application will provide the candidate with the necessary
skills to become an independent investigator focused on the development and implementation of alcohol
misuse interventions for American Indian (AI) young adults. The activities in the K01 include utilizing
community-based participatory research to culturally re-center a Contingency Management alcohol intervention
that combines technology-based engagement strategies and behavioral economic theoretical models to
increase retention of AI 18-29 year olds. To support the achievement of career and research goals the
candidate has carefully assembled a team of experts in the areas of culturally tailoring substance use disorder
treatments among AI people, community-based participatory research, behavioral economics, Contingency
Management and technology delivered alcohol interventions among young adults (Drs. Kamilla Venner; Nina
Wallerstein; James Murphy; Matthew Pearson; Michael McDonell and J. Scott Tonigan). The candidate’s
training goals include: 1) Acquire the content knowledge to develop culturally grounded alcohol use disorder
interventions and apply behavioral economic theoretical models with AI communities; 2) Harness technology in
the delivery of alcohol use disorder interventions; 3) Strengthen expertise in mixed, methods longitudinal and
advance statistical analyses; and 4) Grant writing. In partnership with a rural reservation community, the
candidate will implement an enhanced Contingency Management (CM) intervention for at risk drinkers (AUDIT
> 8) aged18-29 year old, with a focus on enhancing treatment attendance and engagement in substance free
activities. This objective will be achieved in two phases, with Phase I consisting of establishing a Community
Advisory Board that will guide the research and assist with conducting four focus groups (n = 8 per group) and
twenty semi-structured interviews with young adults, providers and cultural leaders to identify the form and
structure of a culturally centered approach to treatment and engagement in CM and substance-free activities.
Phase II will involve a 12-week two-group RCT (n = 60) that compares standard CM with the re-centered CM
plus. Fixed assessments will occur at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12-weeks and the enhanced CM condition will
employ mobile devices to assess substance free activities weeks 10-12. Study aims will address (1) whether
rewarding treatment attendance and alcohol abstinence increases retention and abstinence, and (2) assess
daily community recovery alternatives and engagement in substance-free activities. As an exploratory analysis,
we will also assess secondary outcomes to determine responders and non-responders to the planned
intervention. Collectively, career development and research activities are tightly integrated and mutually
supportive thus offering an ideal platform for Dr. Hirchak to become an independent investigator."

The long-term objective of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to support Dr. Tessa
Frohe, in building an independent research career focused on adapting, designing, and implementing efficacious
telehealth alcohol interventions among marginalized communities. To date, Dr. Frohe’s research has focused
on risk factors associated with pain and substance use. During her postdoctoral training, she has begun working
within a community-based and qualitative methods framework to examine alcohol use specifically among people
experiencing homelessness and AUD; however, Dr. Frohe seeks to expand her training from basic alcohol
research to implementing and testing technology-based interventions informed by community stakeholders and
user-centered design to improve treatment delivery among this population. This long-term objective will be
achieved through a five-year training and research plan involving a carefully selected mentor team, targeted
coursework, and hands-on training experiences. The proposed research aims to adapt an in-person harm
reduction intervention (HaRT-A) into a telehealth platform (eHaRT-A) and test it among individuals with lived
experience of homelessness and AUD. This project will occur in two phases: Phase 1 will entail codevelopment
with iterative usability testing of the telehealth platform with a community advisory board (e.g., Housing First
residents) to leverage stakeholder ideas to inform and build the eHaRT-A prototype (Aim 1) and to make design
changes that will improve the feasibility and acceptability of the eHaRT-A platform (Aim 2). In Phase 2, a
randomized controlled trial will be conducted to test the efficacy of eHaRT-A compared to “supportive services
as usual” in improving alcohol-related outcomes (i.e., peak alcohol use, alcohol-related harm, AUD symptoms,
and positive urinary ethyl glucuronide tests) and health related quality of life over time (Aim 3).
This proposal aligns with national (NIH; NOT-AA-20-011) health initiatives to integrate technology-based
interventions for vulnerable and marginalized communities with pre-existing substance use treatments. If
successful, this study will develop a clinically relevant intervention that is more easily transportable to
marginalized community settings because it will be developed for, by, and with the community it aims to serve.
The training plan for this application will focus on intervention development and testing, innovative methods to
enhance technology-based intervention implementation, and advanced statistics. Mentors (Drs. Clifasefi, Collins,
Comtois, Hsieh) and collaborators (Drs. Larimer, Hallgren) are committed to Dr. Frohe’s training and each will
provide unique expertise to her proposed research and training plan. Support from this award will be essential
to Dr. Frohe’s development as an independent scientist who can contribute to alcohol research by codeveloping,
adapting, and testing successful technology-based interventions to ameliorate alcohol-related harm and improve
individuals’ quality of life. The University of Washington is well suited to provide a stellar training experience and
will promote NIH’s mission to develop early investigators who can be competitive for long-term research funding."
10906149,"Abstract
Even though highly potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) has the ability to reduce viral replication to undetectable
levels in the plasma in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected monkeys, our recently developed viral env
directed immunoPET/CT imaging technology has been able to detect foyers of continued SIV signals even after
prolonged ART. However, the ability of this non-invasive technique to map SIV signal in the CNS have thus far
been elusive. In this application we propose to focus on the development of probes and strategies to specifically
address SIV signals in the CNS, by optimizing the technology to enable SIV specific PET probes to cross the
blood brain barrier and mark cells expressing SIV env in vivo. Towards this goal we will use the pigtailed
macaque model infected with SIVsmB670/SIVmac239-17E-Fred developed and validated by the team of Dr.
Clements as one of the most reliable models of neuroHIV. Leveraging the strength and technological advances
available at the New Iberia Research Center and Georgia Tech, we will map the seeding of reservoirs in the
CNS during acute infection and monitor the kinetic of viral signals post-acute infection using a combination of
immunoPET/CT, light-sheet and confocal imaging techniques, as well as sorting of infected cells to document
the nature and function of cells remaining active in the early chronic phase of CNS SIV infection. Next we will
document the dynamics of viral kinetics in the CNS relative to total body upon ART initiation, as well as post-
ART interruption. Data generated from these highly detailed analyses will delineate which cells retain persistent
viral replication under ART (if any) and more importantly evaluate the contribution of CNS viral reservoirs to the
early viral rebound in vivo. The in depth analysis of this data will also provide important steps towards the
development of cure strategies that include the CNS."
10880142,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to provide insight into the structure, dynamic interactions and multifunctionality of
the enamel protein ameloblastin (Ambn), and hence to contribute to the fundamental knowledge as relevant
to enamel biomineralization. Ambn is multifunctional with critical roles in the regulation of mineral formation,
cell differentiation, cell polarization, and cell–matrix adhesion. We recently identified a novel, highly-conserved
amphipathic helix (AH) cell binding domain, located within the sequence encoded by exon 5, and adjacent to
the C-terminus of the well-established Ambn self-assembly/co-assembly domain. Our preliminary data using
two novel CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing mouse models in which different parts of the AH domain are deleted,
show that the AH plays essential roles in amelogenesis. Analysis of enamel from homozygous strains with
different deletion mutations on AH domain revealed distinct enamel phenotypes that exhibited
hypomineralization with different severity. These observations along with recent published reports from our
laboratory have led us to hypothesize that Ambn is a matricellular protein, and its complex role in
amelogenesis relies on a multitargeting property centered in the region of the sequence encoded by exon 5.
Ambn interacts with ameloblast cells via the AH domain and functions to anchor the mineralizing extracellular
matrix to enamel-forming cells. To test our hypothesis, we seek to implement a mechanistic approach to
interrogate the structure and function of the multitargeting motif in Ambn, including the AH domain. This will
be achieved by 1) conducting a detailed investigation of enamel formation in two novel Ambn AH mutant
mouse models in vivo (Aim I), 2) examining Ambn-cell interactions in 3-D cell culture (Aim II), and 3)
completing an in vitro investigation of interacting domains in the Ambn sequence involved in its self-assembly,
amelogenin (Amel), other potential targets, and cell membrane interactions (Aim III). Overall, our studies will
advance understanding of the molecular function of Ambn in enamel biomineralization and of inherited enamel
disease, elucidate genetic factors leading to caries susceptibility, and contribute to our efforts to regenerate
dental hard tissues."
10880143,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our dentition plays important daily roles in speech, mastication, and determination of facial shape and expression.
The tooth root is essential for the proper function of the dentition because it anchors the tooth within the maxilla
or mandible. In addition, the root helps transmit and balance occlusal forces through periodontal ligaments and
serves as a passageway for the neurovascular bundle that supplies blood and innervation to our teeth. To date,
we have limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of root development and patterning. Understanding
the signaling mechanism that regulates the fate of progenitors during tooth root development and patterning, and
how signaling pathway disruption can lead to craniofacial malformations, will advance stem cell-mediated tooth
root regeneration. Importantly, we have identified Gli1+ progenitors that are crucial for the development and
patterning of roots. These progenitors are heterogenous and may have different functions. To gain a
comprehensive understanding of all progenitor cells and their roles in tooth root development, we developed a
spatiotemporal single-cell atlas of neural crest lineage diversification and cellular function during this process.
Building on this work and preliminary data, we have designed studies to test the hypotheses that (i) FGF signaling
from the trigeminal nerve directly controls progenitors during root development; (ii) Piezo1 and Piezo2 function
downstream of FGF signaling to control the fate of progenitors; and (iii) Kdm6b and Ezh2 antagonistically regulate
Trp53 expression downstream of FGF signaling to regulate root elongation and patterning. We propose the
following three specific aims to test our hypotheses. Specific Aim 1: To investigate how FGF signaling from the
trigeminal nerve controls the fate of progenitors during root development. We will also investigate how FGF-
regulated downstream target genes exert their functional specificity in regulating root development. Specific Aim
2: To investigate the functional significance of Piezo1 and Piezo2 as FGF signaling mediators in regulating the
fate of progenitors during root development. We will elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which signals from
the dental mesenchyme control root development. Specific Aim 3: To investigate how Kdm6b controls the fate of
progenitors during root development. We will also investigate the antagonistic interaction between Kdm6b and
Ezh2 in regulating Trp53 to control root patterning and uncover the regulatory mechanism by which Trp53 controls
progenitors in root development."

 Ribosome hibernation is a conserved mechanism used by both bacteria and eukaryotes to prevent translation
and to extend organismal lifespan. Recent studies from various bacterial species, including pathogenic
Staphylococcus aureus, have provided compelling evidence for a critical role of hibernating 100S ribosomes in
protecting the ribosomal pool from damage, in addition to blocking translational initiation. We found that S. aureus
ribosomes lacking hibernation-promoting factor (HPF) are rapidly degraded by the 3’-5’ exonuclease RNase
R and other hitherto unknown ribonucleases. In our unpublished work, we isolated an additional ribonuclease
mutant that rescues the loss of ribosomes in S. aureus. Surprisingly, we found that ribosomes are not the only
target of S. aureus HPF; instead, HPF could interact with a cytoplasmic protein of unknown biological activity,
thereby reducing the abundance of hibernating 100S ribosomes. We further demonstrated that HPF is restricted
to a specific subcellular localization during rapid growth, providing a rare glimpse of possible HPF segregation
from actively translating ribosomes. In this proposal, we will undertake a highly multidisciplinary approach
consisting of structural biology, omics, bacterial genetics, biochemistry and high-resolution microscopy to
achieve the following goals: (1) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which HPF protects ribosomes from
ribonucleolytic cleavage. (2) Determine the previously undiscovered extraribosomal role of HPF. (3) Determine
how the spatiotemporal localization of HPF avoids translation conflicts. HPF and RNase R are evolutionarily
conserved virulence factors among nosocomial gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, completion of these
aims will provide significant mechanistic insight into innovative counterstrategies to combat recalcitrant infections
by perturbing the biogenesis and turnover of hibernating ribosomes."
10902113,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
While considerable progress has been made in treating primary breast cancers, metastatic breast cancers re-
main a challenge. Metastatic breast cancer cells typically have chromosomal instability (CIN) that involves
chromosome-level alterations leading to genomic copy number abnormalities. A major challenge in targeting
breast cancers driven by CIN is the lack of known targetable alterations. We recently found that CIN pro-
motes chronic inflammatory signaling in cancer cells. As chromosomes missegregate, they often become en-
capsulated in micronuclei. Subsequent micronuclear rupture exposes genomic double-stranded DNA to the
cytosol. Cytosolic DNA activates anti-viral innate immune pathways, chief among which is cGAS-STING signal-
ing. Under normal circumstances, cGAS-STING activation promotes type I interferon and facilitates cell-
mediated immunity. Engagement of STING in normal epithelial cells induces senescence and cell death. We
have shown that cancer cells, however, are intrinsically resistant to cGAS-STING activation by virtue of their
chronic exposure to cytosolic DNA. Instead, they upregulate alternative pathways downstream of STING, such
as NF-κB signaling. The extent to which cancer cells depend on chronic inflammatory signaling is poorly un-
derstood. More importantly, how they subvert innate immune signaling to avoid immune surveillance remains
unknown. Our ongoing work reveals that cGAS-STING signaling is sequestered in cancer cells away from the
host. Furthermore, human breast tumors upregulate ENPP1, a negative regulator of cGAS-STING signaling.
ENPP1 enables immune evasion by degrading cGAMP, the second messenger produced by cGAS, only in the
extracellular space. As such ENPP1 prevents host STING activation in response to tumor-to-host cGAMP
transfer. Strikingly, pharmacologic inhibition of STING suppresses metastasis in syngeneic models of melano-
ma, breast, and colon cancers. We postulate this is because its inhibition in tumor cells outweighs its protective
role in the host. Building on this work, we will expand our pre-clinical testing of STING inhibition in breast can-
cer probing its efficacy in delaying metastasis and therapeutic resistance (Aim 1). We will then examine
whether cGAMP contributes toward the formation of an immune suppressive microenvironment through meta-
bolic breakdown in the extracellular space (Aim 2). Finally, we will develop cGAS-STING-based biomarkers in
prospectively collected tumor specimens. We will test whether the status of cGAS-STING signaling and
ENPP1 levels can predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and atezolizumab, an immunotherapeutic
recently approved for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (Aim 3). Our work addresses a clinically unmet
need by targeting a subset of breast cancers with CIN and for which there are limited therapeutic options. If
successful it will provide pre-clinical rationale for first-in-human testing of STING inhibitors for the treatment of
cancer metastasis as well as the development of novel CIN-related biomarkers to predict therapeutic response."
10902114,"Diagnosis and Treatment of APOBEC Mutagenesis in Metastatic Breast Cancer
Summary: Although the majority of early stage estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers are cured
through multimodality care, metastatic ER-positive breast cancer remains a lethal disease. Insights into this
discrepancy have come through comparative genomic analyses of primary and metastatic tumors. We and
others have identified several mutations affecting specific genes that are more prevalent in metastatic cancers
than in their primary counterparts, including ESR1, ERBB2, and NF1. These mutations result in resistance to
front-line endocrine treatments that are the mainstay systemic therapy in ER-positive breast cancer. Even
more striking than such individual mutations, however, has been the finding that certain `mutational signatures'
are enriched in metastatic disease as compared to primary breast cancers. These mutational signatures
represent the DNA damage and repair processes that shape the cancer genome and can give rise to such
mutations and the transformed phenotypes they convey. A glaring and consistent finding from multiple large-
scale sequencing studies has been that the APOBEC mutational signature is both enriched and highly
prevalent in ER-positive metastatic disease, comprising the dominant mutational signature for these drug-
resistant and ultimately lethal cancers. Our preliminary data confirm that APOBEC activation can promote the
development of endocrine resistance in ER-positive cancer models and is associated with characteristic
APOBEC-mutational changes in many drug resistance alleles. Together, these results point to the APOBEC
mutational process as a key driver in the development and pathogenesis of ER-positive metastatic breast
cancer and endocrine therapy resistance. In this highly collaborative and innovative project, we propose three
specific aims to advance the APOBEC mutational process as a biomarker and therapeutic target in breast
cancer. (1) We will develop and utilize robust bioinformatic methods to detect the presence and the timing of
onset of the APOBEC mutational signature from clinical NGS datasets of both tumor and cell free DNA
(cfDNA). We will further ascertain if a promising IHC assay for the A3B enzyme can identify those ER-positive
cancers likely to subsequently develop an APOBEC mutational signature. (2) We will determine the
mechanisms and kinetics of APOBEC's contribution to endocrine resistance. We will use isogenic cell line
models and patient derived xenografts to dissect the types of resistance patterns that are caused by APOBEC
as well their timing and whether the endocrine therapy itself contributes to the induction of APOBEC activity.
(3) We will assess both immunologic and synthetic lethal approaches to targeting tumors in which APOBEC
activity is induced and determine their capabilities in killing APOBEC-positive cancers. We anticipate that our
findings will uniquely position our team to launch clinical trials testing specific approaches to diagnose
APOBEC-positive tumors, to prevent the development of resistance to endocrine therapies, and to target the
largest subset of ER-positive endocrine-resistant metastatic breast cancers."
10902116,"Project Abstract/ Summary (DRP)
Breast cancers frequently harbor specific patterns of homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair defects (HRD)
and/or specific patterns of genetic instability, namely chromosomal instability (CIN) and APOBEC mutagenesis.
These alterations are present in a substantial proportion of breast cancers and they are enriched in metastatic
disease. Biomarkers to identify these patients reliably and to define the optimal treatments for these patients are
sorely needed. The Developmental Research Program (DRP) will play an important role in fostering translational
research endeavors focusing on breast cancer, in particular research addressing specific patterns of DNA repair
defects and/or genetic instability and their molecular basis. We will use DRP funding supplemented by a strong
commitment of institutional funds to support innovative projects by new and established investigators, which are
critical to the generation of new ideas in the diagnosis and treatment of this large subset of breast cancers. Our
goal is to establish mechanisms for rapid funding of important new directions to accelerate progress towards the
translational research goals of our SPORE. We identified a credible portfolio of promising developmental
research projects, which will be competing for support once the program is established. We will request pilot
project proposals with translational potential from clinical and basic investigators within the larger MSKCC
community, including Rockefeller University, New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College
of Cornell University. We will then select the most promising new projects for support after rigorous peer review
by the Leadership Committee, the Internal Advisory Board and the Patient Advocates. The opinion of external
reviewers will be solicited as needed. Pilot projects will be funded for 1 year, but investigators may apply for
additional funding through this same competitive process the next year. Every year the Advisory and Leadership
Committee members will meet to review each research project, core, career enhancement project and
developmental pilot project. Committee members will be asked to assess whether any developmental project
has progressed sufficiently and shown enough translational potential, so as to eclipse one of the full SPORE
Research Projects. The committee members will then vote and decide whether any developmental project should
be advanced to full project status. If so, the budgets will be appropriately adjusted and sent for approval with the
TRP of the NCI."
