10818256,"PROJECT SUMMARY - ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Administrative Core provides leadership and governance for the proposed UCSD Learning Health
Systems Center and ensures that the program activities remain within the Center's scientific area of focus. The
Principal Investigator, Dr. Ming Tai-Seale, and Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Michael Hogarth, with the
assistance of the administrative core staff, an Executive Committee and Advisory Committee will ensure that
the core services are of the highest quality and that the core resources are used efficiently and equitably by
Learning Health System Scientists at UCSD and community partners. The Administrative Core will manage
and coordinate interactions among the PI, Co-PI, Advisory Committee, Executive Committee, the core
directors, LHS Scientists, mentors, other researchers at UC San Diego, as well as community partners (El
Centro Regional Medical Center, Family Health Centers of San Diego), three patient stakeholders, four health
system stakeholders, AHRQ and PCORI program officers. UC San Diego has a track record of excellence in
training clinical and research scientists. We have longstanding and well-established partnerships with multiple
federally qualified health centers and other healthcare delivery systems in the area and across the U.S. The
Administrative Core will lead outreach efforts and use multiple communication methods, including in-person
conversations, virtual meeting, and a website about the Center with FAQs, to ensure that all members of the
UCSD community, community partners, and professionals with an affinity to LHS science are aware of the
opportunity to engage with the proposed UCSD LHS Center. Building on principles of justice, equity, diversity,
and inclusion, and the Asset-Based Community Development framework, every effort will be made to recruit
and retain qualified LHS Scientists. The proposed UCSD LHS Center focuses on the application and mastery
of the AHRQ core LHS scientist competencies to support the professional development of scientists to conduct
research that accelerates progress towards an integrated learning health system. The UCSD LHS Center will
build new models of LHS infrastructure that support and enhance existing institutional training and research
infrastructure organized around shared resources and research infrastructure. The Administrative Core will
support matriculated LHS Scientists by facilitating mentoring and training relationships with faculty and
community partners that align with their research interests. Career development opportunities will be
coordinated. By bringing together faculty mentors and methodologists, the proposed Center will be able to use
and pool knowledge of mentors to develop the didactic curriculum and learn from one another as they share
their experiences in helping LHS Scientists to navigate their way through successful LHS projects. This
approach will produce a cadre of LHS Scientists, LHS mentors, and rapid learning LHS projects that can
accelerate advances in knowledge, health system performance, and patient outcomes."
10818257,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research Education Core
As an essential core of the Center, the Research Education Core (REC) will build new LHS research and
learning infrastructure that strengthens institutional research training in comparative effectiveness research
(CER) and patient centered outcomes research (PCOR); enhances diversity in the LHS research workforce;
strengthens partnerships with community partners and health systems and other stakeholders; and conducts
PCOR/CER projects to improve health system operations, quality, and health outcomes. The REC will
implement a plan to enhance training, professional development, and diversity in the LHS workforce, by
recruiting a cadre of diverse LHS scientists and match them with mentors with expertise in relevant areas and
supporting them in receiving didactic and experiential learning opportunities. The REC will include the following
components:
• Supporting PCOR/CER research projects for LHS scientists relevant to AHRQ/PCORI priorities: LHS
 scientists will propose PCOR/CER research projects relevant to AHRQ/PCORI priorities after they have
 a good understanding of the priorities of learning health systems where they plan to conduct their
 research. The REC guidance committee (PI, Co-PI, and core faculty members) will provide feedback to
 LHS scientists to ensure alignment of the two sets of priorities and the professional interests of LHS
scientists.
• Mentoring LHS scientists to achieve research career training objectives: The proposed UCSD LHS
 Center offers an ideal infrastructure to support mentoring, didactic, and experiential training of LHS
 scientists because of the combination of University of California San Diego as a highly ranked public
 university in the U.S. and learning health systems including UC San Diego Health, El Centro Regional
 Medical Center, and the Family Health Centers of San Diego.
• Mentorship within academic settings: Researchers from diverse backgrounds and groups
underrepresented in science are faculty and mentors in the REC. These individuals have remarkable
research expertise and experience relevant to the proposed Center and demonstrate a rich history of
their role as LHS Science mentors."

Hundreds of thousands of children (669,799) were confirmed victims of maltreatment in the United States in
2017. In that same year, 34% of the 442,733 children in foster care had been in more than one placement and
11% were in a group home or institution. Out-of-home placement decisions have extremely high stakes for the
present and future well-being of these children because some placement types, and multiple placements, are
associated with poor outcomes. But which children require --and, more importantly, would benefit-- from a
placement in residential care? Decision-making support tools currently used by states to recommend specific
level-of-care (LOC) placements for children do not maximize the rich data and innovative methodological
approaches that are being explored in other fields like medicine. In addition, structured decision making (SDM)
has been used to guide decisions about risk in child welfare settings but, in comparison to predictive modelling,
SDM is limited by the use of a smaller group of factors to make recommendations. Outcome Referrals, Inc. has
employed sophisticated machine learning techniques over the past 10 years to risk-adjust behavioral health
outcome data for clients using their current characteristics. We have evidence of the predictive validity of this
approach for generating risk-adjusted scores via the PCORI-funded RCT in which clients were matched with
clinicians who had previous clients who did well in treatment. With the assistance of NIH SBIR funding, we
plan to improve the success rates of children in the child welfare system with an innovative, scientifically-
derived tool called “Placement Success Predictor” to guide level-of-care decision-making. This product will use
machine learning algorithms to predict individualized outcomes for children and adolescents in a particular
placement type. During the Phase I project, we developed and validated machine learning models to predict
the probability of each youth’s success within placement types and conducted usability testing of a prototype to
assess potential barriers to implementation. The likelihood of success recommendations provided by the
machine learning models developed for the “Placement Success Predictor” clinical decision-making support
tool were associated with improved youth well-being (i.e., those children that were placed in the Placement
Success Predictor-recommended placement had four times higher success rates). Potential future users found
the prototype of this tool easy to use. The machine learning models appear to distinguish clients who will do
well in various placement types and suggest that only 10% of clients would be successful in higher-cost level of
care. With the Family First Prevention Act, states are now required to pay the average $88,000 per year to
keep a child in residential care if that high level of care is not authorized. We submit this tool could help
improve overall outcomes and reduce healthcare costs when and if high-cost residential care options are
judiciously provided to children who are most likely to benefit from them. In Phase II we propose to develop this
flexible program to generate placement recommendations per client based on automatically updated custom,
site-specific machine learning prediction models then assess its efficacy and effectiveness."
10820082,"Technical Abstract
 Neurodegenerative disorders affect over 40 million people worldwide and most, if not all, are mediated by
inflammation. Even though several drugs are approved by the FDA for treating neurological disorders such as
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), their efficacy as AD therapeutics has not been realized as extremely low levels of the
drug reach the brain. The goal of this Phase I project is to develop an effective targeted delivery system for the
bioactive curcuminoids, curcumin (CUR) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), to mitigate AD and potentially other
neuroinflammatory diseases. We will apply our extensive experience in exosomes, drug delivery, plant
therapeutics and inflammatory responses for efficient, targeted delivery of bioactive curcuminoids to the
microenvironment of the brain where progressive increase in inflammation, amyloid plaque formation and
neurofibrillary tangles ultimately leads to manifestation of AD. We hypothesize that the combined administration
of CUR and BDMC will be highly effective at ameliorating neuroinflammation and aberrant AD-related gene
expression returning these biomarkers to pre-disease levels due to synergistic action via different mechanisms.
We also hypothesize that folic acid (FA)-functionalized exosomal formulations administered using a novel topical,
trans-spinal (t.s.) route will provide enhanced targeting to AD-related regions of the brain, including the cortex and
hippocampus. Exosomes cross the BBB efficiently and areas of the brain associated with AD have high levels of
folate receptors (FRs). Thus, t.s.-administered FA-ExoCUR/BDMC will deliver higher payload to the brain vs.
conventional routes. Our hypotheses are supported by 1) effective drug loading of curcuminoids onto bovine
colostrum exosomes, 2) higher levels (~5-fold brain) of curcuminoids in rodent tissues after oral treatment with
Exo-curcuminoids than free curcuminoids, 3) FA-exosomes can increase drug delivery to the brain which contains
high expression of FR4) reduced NFκB accumulation and decreased abundance of phosphorylated Tau (pTau)
and amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression in brain lysates of mice treated orally with ExoCUR/BDMC in
concurrence with increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) comparable to levels in age-
matched untreated WT mice while free CUR/BDMC was ineffective, and 5) higher brain accumulation of exosomes
in mice treated via t.s. route vs. the traditional i.v. route. Investigators experienced in exosomes, drug delivery,
plant bioactives and animal models, leveraging extensive experience of Dr. Robert Friedland in AD research, will
pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Optimize ExoCUR/BDMC formulations and determine biodistribution
and toxicity in WT mice. Aim 2. Determine efficacy of FA-functionalized ExoCUR/BDMC formulations in AD mice.
This project will provide proof-of-principle for the effectiveness of t.s.-delivered FA-ExoCUR/BDMC on the
modulation of key molecular targets and cognitive function behavioral tests with AD progression. In Phase II, we
will conduct dose-finding and longer-term early and late intervention studies using multiple rodent AD models,
immunotoxicity, etc. The t.s.-brain delivery could ultimately lead to the development of t.s. patches for AD."
10806062,"Objectives: To characterize the mechanism by which cannabinoids dynamically regulate synaptic transmission in
the neocortex.
Plan: Specific Aim 1: Determine how cannabinoids change spontaneous synaptic transmission
Using the patch-clamp technique we will record from neuronal wild-type and null cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) mutants
and examine how endogenous and exogenous cannabinoids stimulate spontaneous release.
Specific Aim 2: Determine how cannabinoids change evoked synaptic transmission
Using the patch-clamp technique we will make paired recordings from neocortical neurons and test how synaptic
transmission is affected by the CB1 mutants. Using single terminal recordings we will test if presynaptic ion channel
modulation accounts for the cannabinoid actions.
Specific Aim 3: Determine how cannabinoids shape calcium signaling at excitatory synapses
CaSR affects synaptic transmission in a number of ways, impacting spontaneous and evoked, and inhibitory and
excitatory forms differently. Based on preliminary data we will test to determine if there are functional interactions
between CaSR and CB1
Methods: Using pharmacological and genetic approaches we will determine how cannabinoids affect synaptic
transmission.
Clinical Relevance: Endogenous cannabinoid signaling is vital for important brain functions. Exogenous
cannabinoids have been used as recreational drugs and therapeutically to treat pain, epilepsy, and posttraumatic
stress disorder. CB1 has been identified as a receptor that may be mediating many of these actions but recent data
suggests that CB1 is only partially responsible. We will perform experiments to determine if CB1 is working alone or
with other G-protein coupled receptors as heterodimers to mediate these effects. These experiments will provide us
with preclinical data that characterize the mechanism by which cannabinoids operate at various sites in the brain.
Since the pharmacological characteristics for CB1 will be different when working alone or as a heterodimers
completion of our specific aims will allow us to identify more specific pharmacological targets. Enhanced
understanding of these mechanisms may lead to the refinement of therapeutic cannabinoids that retain therapeutic
effects but have fewer unwanted side effects. The goal is to improve control of pain, seizures, and posttraumatic
stress disorder experienced by Veterans.
Relevance to VA’s Mission: We have experienced a large increase in cannabinoid use in Veterans in association
with its legalization and its promise as therapy for post traumatic disorder, chronic pain, and epilepsy. These
diseases are prevalent in the Veteran population. Unfortunately, the large incidence of side effects with
cannabinoids underlines the need for more effective and less toxic medications. By increasing understanding of the
neural pathways used by endogenous cannabinoids we will identify targets for safer and more effective
can nabinoids."
10805195,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Objectives. A critical need remains for comprehensive, personalized strategies for considering
deprescribing across the lifespan. My long-term goal is to improve pharmacologic stewardship of neurologic
medications to promote healthy aging using decision science techniques. This application’s objective is to
collect preliminary data for a future large, multicenter RCT that will capture how the absolute effect of
discontinuation changes across key subgroups such as evolving healthcare preferences across life (SA1) and
different levels of seizure risk (SA2).
 Aims/Methods. First, we will define how patient preferences influencing ASM decisions change across
the lifespan. We will survey ~300 patients with epilepsy at 4 sites, with stratified sampling across ages. The
survey will include best-worst scaling ranking and time trade-off rating exercises, plus more general questions
assessing willingness to enroll in our future deprescribing trial. A deeper understanding of how patients rank
the importance of seizure relapse versus other factors would more closely align clinicians with patient values,
and therefore enhance our ability to deliver patient-centered values-concordant care. Second, we will improve
post-deprescribing seizure prediction. We will update the prior individualized post-discontinuation seizure risk
calculator by adding modern adult data and statistical techniques for improved out-of-sample predictions in
3,147 international patients. We will then execute decision analytic models to assess which patients might
experience theoretical net benefit versus harm from deprescribing ASMs and the effects of different population-
wide deprescribing strategies. This modeling would improve clinicians’ ability to deliver personalized medicine,
plus facilitate our future trial by developing analytic procedures (the future trial will assess how low seizure risk
must be until deprescribing exerts predicted benefit on quality of life) and justifying which patients to enroll.
Third, we will refine our trial protocol and test procedures at 3 sites for our future planned trial in which we will
randomize seizure-free patients to deprescribing ASMs. This work will result in more personalized evidence-
based recommendations to tailor ASM deprescribing decisions to a person’s risk, healthcare preferences, and
stage of life. This will lead to many R01’s including but not limited to applying these techniques to other
deprescribing decisions particularly as they pertain to neurological medications used by older patients.
 Candidate. Through expert mentorship, advanced coursework, and the intellectually rich environment
of the University of Michigan, this award will develop Dr Terman into a leader using decision sciences
synthesizing patient preferences with risk prediction, and leading clinical trials, aimed at rational
(de)prescribing of central nervous system agents tailored to how preferences and risk change across life."
10806822,"Every day, 44 veterans or active-duty troops complete suicide, primarily due to the ramifications of untreated
depression. Due to fear and stigma, many do not seek treatment. For those who do, about one third of the
time, no drug offers relief and even those antidepressants that do work often require 6-8 weeks before
therapeutic onset. Unfortunately, no unifying hypothesis for a molecular/cellular basis of action for
antidepressant drugs (or depressive disorders) has emerged. Over the last several years, we have suggested
that, in addition to presynaptic targets (uptake sites), antidepressant drugs have a post-synaptic mechanism of
action. Toward this end, we have observed that chronic treatment (3-5 days) of cultured neural or glial cells
with several chemically diverse antidepressant compounds, translocates the heterotrimeric G protein Gsα out
of lipid rafts and into a closer association with adenylyl cyclase. Post-mortem tissue from depressed suicides
shows just the opposite, with an increased proportion of Gsα ensconced in lipid rafts and preliminary data
suggest that this is also observed in blood cells, where the extent of Gsα in lipid rafts correlates with both
depression and clinical response to antidepressants. Furthermore, several experimental compounds may have
antidepressant effects as well as shorter therapeutic onset, and the proposed studies will search for a cellular
“biosignature” for antidepressant action. Proposed studies will also attempt to establish a mechanistic
understanding for the translocation of Gsα from lipid rafts as a hallmark of depression and as a conduit for
antidepressant action. One aspect of this involves an investigation of the interactions between
antidepressants and lipids, particularly the omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish oil (DHA and EPA).
Another aim involved the possibility that tubulin forms the anchor for Gsα in lipid rafts. One potential
application of the proposed studies is to develop a platform that can provide a cell-based screen for putative
antidepressant compounds as well as a screening tool to indicate personalized antidepressant choice. Another
intent of these studies is to provide a peripheral tissue biological marker for depression and an early (< 1
week) indicator of successful antidepressant treatment that can be developed into a clinically useful,
inexpensive and readily available biomarker for clinical use. The identification of a pathway for antidepressant
action might lead to novel antidepressant drugs, while the assignation of a quantitative value for depression
may help overcome stigma and encourage thousands of depressed veterans to seek treatment. Toward this
end, we have developed a new collaboration with the Greater Los Angeles VAMC to do a clinical study that will
help to extend the clinical utility of our depression biomarker in a veteran population."

Intestinal resection remains a common complication in Crohn's disease (CD) despite the advent of advanced
biologics and small molecule therapies. Within one year after ileocolic resection, over 70% of patients with CD
are known to have endoscopic recurrence. Even in patients treated with a biologic treatment, 30% develops
recurrence of CD. Despite significant progress in the management of post-operative CD patients, there is still an
unmet need in efficiently treating and preventing recurrence of CD following ileal resection.
Since 2011, six participating Genetic Research Centres as part of the NIDDK Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Genetic Consortium (IBDGC) have recruited patients for the CD Ileal Post-Operative Study. The consortium-
wide effort has led to a creation of a large biobank of blood, stool, and biopsy samples during the peri-operative
period and at each follow-up post-operative endoscopic procedures. Although these efforts led to important
biomarker discoveries related to post-operative disease recurrence, the mechanism of intestinal inflammation
initiation after ileal resection is still unknown.
For this ancillary study proposal, we aim to better understand the pathophysiology of CD by leveraging the
NIDDK IBDGC Post-operative CD cohort. We propose to make use of the latest high-throughput omics
approaches to this cohort. First, an untargeted in-depth antibody repertoire profiling approach using phase
display technology (PhIP-Seq) will help us identify novel anti-microbial antibodies associated with disease
recurrence. Second, metagenome-assembled genome analysis (MAG) on stool and biopsy samples will help
identify novel gut microbial functional genomic signatures associated with post-operative CD recurrence.
Third, metabolomics analysis will help identify the downstream expression of various changes that occur in the
genome, proteome, and transcriptome, that will ultimately closely represent the phenotypic fingerprints of CD
recurrence. Additionally, the associations between anti-microbial antibodies, microbiome, and metabolome with
post-operative CD recurrence can be assessed for their dependence on specific known ileal CD-associated
genetic variants (e.g., located NOD2, ATG16L1, HLA-DRB1*07:01, LRRK2, MUC19) or combined CD-genetic
risk variants (e.g., CD-polygenic risk score). Taken together, through the research proposed, we anticipate that
significant advances will be made toward a better understanding of the mechanisms of intestinal inflammation
following ileal resection of CD and the translation of these data into clinically meaningful tools that will lead to a
lower recurrence of CD."

Enhancer-promoter (E-P) communication enables gene activation in eukaryotes but despite
advances in many other areas of the field, the nature of this communication is not well understood
mechanistically, particularly within the native chromatin environment of a cell. We have developed
novel systems in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to study E-P communication at both the
physical level, E-P looping, and the functional level, Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC) assembly
and gene activation. We will leverage a key transcription factor termed Estrogen Related Receptor
Beta (ESRRB) that binds in abundance at many mESC enhancers. ESRRB also binds directly to
Mediator, a major co-activator complex controlling enhancer and promoter function. ESRRB-
responsive genes are typically found within looped domains termed Insulated Neighborhoods,
bounded by strong peaks of Cohesin and CTCF. Depletion of ESRRB by siRNAs causes greatly
diminished Mediator binding to ESRRB sites within enhancers and decreased target gene
expression restricted to within Insulated Neighborhoods. In addition, we have developed a degron
system that targets TAF12 and dismantles both TFIID and Pol II PICs, along with gene
expression. We will use these systems, and build onto them, to address fundamental questions
about the physical and functional mechanisms of E-P communication. In Aim 1, we will employ
degrons of ESRRB, Cohesin and TAF12, along with a few select CRISPR deletions of enhancers,
proximal promoters and core promoters. ChIP-seq of key factors, RNA-seq, and Promoter-
Capture Hi-C will be used to quantitate the effects of each degron and genetic deletion on physical
E-P looping and functional interactions including Mediator binding, PIC assembly, chromatin
state, and gene expression. In Aim 2 we will approach the problem orthogonally. Paradoxically,
some ESRRB regulons contain inactive genes expressed later in development. CRISPR-dCAS9
targeting strategies of activation domains (VPR), chromatin modification (p300), and remodeling
machines (BRG1) will be used to ectopically activate these genes, and determine whether this
process depends upon kidnapping the functional enhancer within the regulon. In sum, our
proposal seeks to determine whether physical E-P looping enables or is independent from
functional communication, and what determinants (i.e., PICs, chromatin state, activators, proximal
promoters) control functional interactions. The results will provide important new information on
E-P communication in a well-defined experimental model, highly relevant to development and
differentiation."
10809016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Playing a musical instrument is a popular childhood and adult activity with documented health benefits. One of
the most provocative, but least understood, proposed health benefits is preserved brain function in advanced
age. Playing a musical instrument, however, can also pose significant health hazards, including those that come
from routine exposure to noisy (loud) environments. Beyond the risks of hearing loss from loud environments,
noise exposure is a significant risk factor for age-related functional declines. While both the benefits and risks
of musical training have been widely studied, little attention has been given to their interplay. To understand the
mechanisms that mediate the effects of musical training on the human brain, we must develop a more complete
accounting of the risk factors that could counteract the benefits of musical training and the degree to which
benefits persist in the face of these risks. To more fully harness the therapeutic benefits of music, we also need
a better account of whether the benefits persist after a musician stops playing their instrument. These knowledge
gaps motivate the proposed work on auditory brain aging, in which lifelong musicians will be compared to controls
and to ex-musicians who have not played a musical instrument since childhood. The proposed work is grounded
in our published studies of auditory brain aging, and our published and pilot studies on the interplay of musical
training and noise exposure on the young adult auditory brain. The proposed work aims (1) to characterize
current and lifetime noise exposure from music and non-music activities, (2) to investigate relations among
lifelong musical training, lifetime noise exposure, and auditory-brain aging, and (3) to investigate relations
between childhood musical training and later-life auditory-brain function. For all three aims, young adults (18-
24 years) will be compared to middle-aged adults (45-60 years). We hypothesize that music, as a form of acoustic
enrichment and training, may mitigate the impact of noise injuries and age-related decline by strengthening the
neural systems most vulnerable to being compromised. Our methodological approach is innovative,
comprehensive, and corroborated by our prior work. We will use a novel combination of personal sound
dosimetry and structured interviews to characterize the risk of noise injury. Noise exposure data will be combined
with validated methods to study auditory brain aging across multiple neural circuits, using a statistical design that
accounts for selection bias and confounding variables such as socioeconomic status and cochlear function. Most
studies of human auditory aging focus on older adults (60+ years), with less attention on studying early-stage
aging when opportunities for the prevention of functional decline are greater. This motivates our decision to
focus on early-stage aging. The outcomes of this work may suggest new approaches to promote healthy brain
aging and clinical recommendations about harnessing the therapeutic properties of music training to maximize
benefits and minimize hazards. Our multidisciplinary study team has complementary expertise in auditory
neuroscience (Skoe), noise exposure (Tufts), biostatistics (Harel), and aging (Kuchel)."

There is an urgent need to develop prevention strategies to halt progression of oral premalignant lesions (OPL)
into head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a disease that results in over 300,000 deaths each year
worldwide. Our team discovered that activation of the PI3K/mTOR signaling network is the most frequently
dysregulated cancer-driving signaling mechanism in HNSCC and OPLs and that, in turn, PI3K/mTOR inhibition
exerts potent antitumor activity in experimental OPL and HNSCC models. These findings provided the foundation
for our Phase II clinical trial (NCT01195922) exploring the antitumor activity mTOR blockade in HNSCC patients.
More recently, we showed that repurposing metformin, a drug safely used by millions of type 2 diabetes (T2DM)
patients, decreases mTOR signaling and displays potent chemopreventive activity in experimental OPL models.
Based on these findings, and epidemiological data showing a significantly lower HNSCC incidence in T2DM
patients on metformin, we conducted a Phase IIa trial in individuals with OPL to explore the potential of metformin
to prevent oral cancer (M4OC-Prevent trial; NCT02581137). This represented the first study evaluating the
chemopreventive potential of metformin in OPL. The histologic response rate was 60%, and we found a
significant correlation between histological response and mTOR inhibition in OPL. These results provided the
foundation for launching a multi-institutional NCI-funded Cancer Prevention Clinical Trial (M4OC-Prevent 2.0),
a Phase IIb randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in current and former smokers with OPL to explore
the potential of metformin for oral cancer prevention. However, we still have an incomplete understanding of the
molecular determinants of the therapeutic response to metformin in OPL or in any other precancerous lesions.
The overall objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which metformin acts on OPL
and HNSCC to (a) identify biomarkers for predicting and monitoring clinical response, (b) provide a rationale for
mechanism-based multimodal precision chemoprevention strategies, and (c) prevent and overcome drug
resistance. Leveraging the wealth of data from clinical, genetic, and tissue specimens from our M4OC-Prevent
trial with our team’s expertise in decoding cancer promoting pathways, the long-term goal of our project is to
define (1) mechanistic biomarkers predicting a response to metformin and (2) suitable multimodal therapeutic
options to overcome drug resistance. Our planned studies will uncover new mechanistic and genetic
determinants of metformin sensitivity to inform patient selection in future precision prevention trials, unveil novel
mechanisms by which metformin induces histological response in OPL by the concomitant inhibition of mTOR
and YAP1 signaling, and provide insights into novel a precision immune prevention strategy for metformin-
resistant OPL lesions. By focusing on a cancer with a well-recognized premalignant state and readily accessible
lesions for histological and molecular evaluation, our findings will have a broad impact, as they will enable the
development of metformin as an effective, safe, and low-cost preventive agent for multiple malignancies."
10809022,"Chemical cues, such as odors and tastants, are best known to regulate animal behavior. Interestingly, such
chemical cues not just regulate behavior, but also other types of critical physiological processes such as
longevity. While chemosensory regulation of behavior has been extensively characterized, much less effort has
been devoted to investigating how chemical cues regulate longevity. Food is a primary environmental factor
that affects aging. Dietary restriction (DR) represents one of the most effective means to extend lifespan in all
tested organisms. How dietary restriction (DR) promotes longevity has been a subject of intensive research;
however, the underlying mechanisms are far from clear. Previous effort has mostly focused on characterizing
how food nutrients regulate longevity. It should be noted that in addition to nutrients, other components are
also found in food. One notable example is the odors associated with food. However, though the mechanisms
by which nutrient signaling regulates lifespan has been extensively characterized, much less is known about
the role of food odors in longevity. As such, it remains largely unclear whether, to what extent, and how food
odors regulates longevity. It is also unclear how the chemosensory system is involved. As odors are integral
components of food, addressing this question will help us to achieve a better understanding of how DR
promotes longevity. It will also help us to understand how the chemosensory system regulates longevity. C.
elegans is a nice genetic model for aging research. Thus far, nearly all the major longevity pathways were first
discovered in invertebrate models such as worms, flies and yeast, and subsequently were found to be
evolutionarily conserved in mammals. This, together with a short lifespan (~3 weeks) and facile genetics,
makes C. elegans a highly valuable model for aging research. We found that food odors regulate DR longevity
in C. elegans, and that the chemosensory system plays a key role in mediating the effect of food-derived odors
on DR longevity. Here, we propose to investigate the underlying neural and genetic mechanisms. To do so, we
will use a combination of neuroscience and aging research tools. As longevity mechanisms tend to be
evolutionarily conserved from worms to mammals, the proposed work will provide novel insights into DR-
dependent longevity in other organisms."

Mercury (Hg) is a known neurotoxin considered among the top ten chemicals of public health concern by the
World Health Organization. While the acute effects of Hg are well chronicled, the consequences of chronic,
low-dose exposure are less clear. Given that clinical symptoms of most psychiatric disorders do not emerge
until early adulthood, there is a critical need for better understanding of the neural cell types and circuits most
adversely impacted by adolescent Hg exposure, as well as the associated behavioral phenotypes. At the
molecular level, Hg irreversibly binds to catalytic selenium (Se) moieties present in antioxidant selenoenzymes,
leading to redox dysregulation, altered Ca2+ homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Growing evidence
indicates that oxidative stress impedes maturation of GABAergic circuitry, resulting in a permanent imbalance
between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. Moreover, among GABAergic cell types, fast-spiking,
parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVIs) are most acutely impacted by redox imbalance. The long-term
goal of this project is to better understand how interactions between Hg exposure and dietary Se status
influence maturation of excitatory-inhibitory balance and the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Our
central hypothesis is that Hg-mediated inhibition of selenoenzyme activity during adolescence preferentially
impairs PVIs, leading to irreversible deficits in excitatory-inhibitory tone and behavior. Our research team has
expertise to definitively assess the effects of altered Se metabolism on molecular, immunohistological, and
behavioral indices in rodents, with innovative tools and assays established to successfully perform the
proposed studies. Our two specific aims are as follows: Aim #1: Determine the effects of Hg on Se-dependent
redox balance, excitatory-inhibitory tone, and electrophysiological activity in primary cortical cultures. Aim #2:
Characterize the immediate and long-term effects of subtoxic juvenile Hg exposure on brain, behavior, and gut
microbiota."

Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are a leading cause of cancer death and morbidity in children. CNS
tumors, including the most common subtype – medulloblastomas, are routinely treated with external beam
radiation therapy (xRT) as well as neurosurgery and chemotherapy, and improvements in these treatment
modalities have increased survival and cure rates over the last four decades. However, over half of the pediatric
patients treated with xRT experience life-altering neurocognitive impairment (NI), which is especially
prominent in children diagnosed at a young age. In fact, young children commonly exhibit impairments in
learning, memory, executive processing, visual acuity and fine motor coordination post xRT at vastly higher
rates and with more severity than adults treated with similar doses. Despite the clear importance of
maximizing post-treatment quality of life for childhood CNS cancer survivors, our understanding of the
mechanisms driving xRT-induced neurotoxicity is limited and no clinically-useful mitigators currently exist.
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is an evolutionarily-conserved cell death pathway that is critical for normal
development, maintenance of tissue homeostasis, and cancer prevention. This pathway is carefully controlled
by the BCL-2 family of proteins, which contains both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival members that control the
commitment to apoptotic cell death. Most anti-cancer therapies induce apoptosis in cancerous or normal cells
by damaging key cellular components such as DNA or microtubules or by blocking key signaling pathways. We
have found that apoptosis is dynamically regulated in healthy tissues during postnatal life. This regulation
drives cell fate decisions in response to damage or stress and provides an explanation for why many children
develop cognitive deficits from cancer treatments. In addition, we found that developing brain tissue can be
protected from treatment-associated apoptosis by blocking BAX-mediated apoptosis. However, it is unclear
which cells within the developing brain are most likely to undergo radiation-induced apoptosis at key
developmental time points and how the loss of each cell type contributes to long-term neurocognitive sequelae.
Within this proposal, we will 1) compare cell fates induced by xRT at the single cell level within neuronal, glial
and vascular endothelial cells within the neonatal, juvenile and adult mouse brain and establish their role in
xRT-induced NI and 2) evaluate the potential to reduce or eliminate xRT-induced neurotoxicity by blocking
apoptosis genetically or pharmacologically (via upstream regulators) and the long-term effects of apoptosis
inhibition. These studies will bring much-needed clarity to the field of xRT-induced neurotoxicity and lay the
groundwork for future clinical applications that meaningfully improves the lives of pediatric brain cancer
survivors and their families."

Selection of therapeutics for patients with different AD phenotypes (i.e differing ethnic phenotypes and varying
disease severity) should not be done by serendipity, but should be guided by differences in activation of
immune circuits, and respective barrier alterations. Our overarching hypothesis is that different AD
endotypes (based on ethnicity and severity) have different molecular phenotypes in skin and blood
that may require use of different therapeutic approaches. The sub-hypothesis underlying our first
project is that discrete subtypes/endotypes of AD exist within different ethnic populations. Our first
project aims to define the skin and blood phenotypes of moderate-to-severe AD patients from Africa and Asia,
and determine whether they are similar to those of AA and Asian AD patients in the US, implying global African
and Asian AD phenotypes. The sub-hypothesis underlying our second project is that severe AD may be
considered a systemic disease of the entire skin surface with immune activation extending to non-
lesional skin and circulating cytokines, while mild disease may reflect only focal lesional skin
inflammation without major systemic involvement. This may explain the need for systemic treatments and
the inadequacy of treating only lesional skin with topical agents in severe patients. This study will define an
onset point for systemic inflammation that may necessitate systemic treatments. The aim of the second project
is to define the skin and blood biomarkers associated with increasing disease severity (from mild/limited
through severe/extensive disease). The study will enroll adult AD patients and controls above 18 years old.
SCORAD, EASI, body surface area (BSA), NRS pruritus and sleep loss assessments will be performed. Blood
for CBC, serum (for circulating cytokines and chemokines, IgE and specific IgE levels), and flow cytometry, will
be drawn. PAX RNA (for gene expression) and PAX DNA (for genetic analyses) blood samples will be taken.
4.5 mm lesional/LS and non-lesional/NL punch biopsies will be performed for skin profiling using genomic
(RNAseq and qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry approaches. TEWL and swabs for microbiome will be
performed from the same locations prior to biopsies. Exome sequencing will be performed to assess for
genetic ancestry of each ethnicity/severity group. This is the first investigation that provides a system biology
approach for AD, aiming to produce a molecular map of AD across its different ethnic backgrounds and
disease severity sub-groups, which can possibly identify new therapeutics specifically geared towards a
particular ethnic background, or severity. The proposal will set the stage for personalized therapy for AD based
on skin and blood biomarkers (barrier, immune activation, microbiome, genetic risk alleles) related to ethnicity
and severity, and will promote testing and development of innovative pathway-directed therapeutic approaches
for the different ethnic backgrounds and varying AD severity."

While dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most common hereditary heart diseases, we currently lack
effective and targeted treatments. Cardiac fibrosis is an important hallmark of DCM and the presence of
excessive fibrotic tissues can severely hamper heart function. However, limited information exists on how DCM
mutations can induce cardiac fibrosis in familial DCM patients. This study aims to address this significant
knowledge gap using patient-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from common
DCM patients. In Aim 1, we will differentiate iPSCs into cardiac fibroblasts (iPSC-CFs) and cardiomyocytes
(iPSC-CMs) to study how cardiomyocyte-specific and non-cardiomyocyte-specific mutations can activate cardiac
fibroblasts. In Aim 2, we will examine whether iPSC-CFs induce cardiac dysfunction through secretory factors
and/or direct interaction with cardiomyocytes using a 3D engineered heart tissues (EHT) platform. In Aim 3, we
will identify gene/mutation-specific druggable targets using state-of-the-art CRISPR/dCas9i (inhibitory) and
CRISPR/dCas9a (activating) technologies, and validate these targets in an established DCM mouse model. By
completing this study, we expect to identify fibrosis-inducing DCM mutations, understand how they activate
cardiac fibroblasts, and potentially discover novel druggable mechanism to manage DCM. Collectively, this multi-
PI R01 study has tremendous translational value to aid future precision cardiovascular medicine."
10794870,"An interdisciplinary historical study of a global health crisis, focused primarily on North America,
Sweet Blood traces how today’s diabetes epidemic grows from changing relationships with nature over the
past 150 years, and how those relationships create or reinforce social inequities that further drive illness,
comorbidities, and social differences.
 A NLM-NIH grant will provide essential funding to assist remaining research as well as time away
from the classroom for a sabbatical to finish the book manuscript. As a scholar-teacher at a selective
residential liberal arts college, the twinned gifts of research and leave support are vital to maintain
scholarly productivity. My additional training in epidemiology will also allow me to complete a project
applicable to public health.
 Sweet Blood fills a significant gap in our knowledge of diabetes by analyzing how an expanded and
historicized understanding of “environment” reveals the origins and persistence of social determinants of ill
health. The project draws upon scholarship in four distinct academic fields. First, environmental history,
which demonstrates how microbes, animals, and other forces of nature act upon history by reinforcing or
limiting human agency. Second, the history of medicine, which connects race, gender, and class to
reconsider how illnesses and identities entwine. Third, science and technology studies, which emphasizes
how contests over expertise are shaped by engagement with material nature and cultural norms. Finally,
social epidemiology, which pools diverse methodologies to evaluate the origins and distribution of disease
and health inequities. “Sweet Blood” connects these fields through extensive archival and primary source
research to offer an important and timely reinterpretation of diabetes.
 Sweet Blood thus examines diabetes on several interlocking levels. It is a story of diabetes as
material reality, of its increase and spread over the course of the twentieth century. It is a story of the
creation of knowledge about diabetes to aid diagnosis, promote prevention, and assist treatment from
clinical findings to entire populations. And it is a story of diabetes as a cultural symbol for ideas and
practices about health, human behavior, and the environment that often generate inequalities. Sweet
Blood blends these stories to reframe diabetes as a series of environmental relationships that change over
time and space. This project will result in a book (under contract) with Yale University Press."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by the
accumulation of tau tangles and amyloid plaques. Current consensus is that the AD pathological process begins
decades before overt clinical symptoms occur. Emerging evidence suggests that sleep disruption may be an
important factor in both early cognitive deterioration leading to AD and in the metabolism of amyloid and tau.
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep disorder in the US with an estimated prevalence of
40-50% in the cognitively normal elderly. We have previously shown that OSA severity is associated with
longitudinal increase in brain amyloid load, but less is known about the long-term effects of OSA on tau and its
hyperphosphorylation, a crucial step in the formation of tangles, as well as the effects of OSA on spatial
navigational memory, perhaps the earliest form of memory affected in AD. Our preliminary cross-sectional
data suggest that higher OSA severity is associated with higher levels of total tau (T-tau) and phosphorylated
tau (P-tau) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and poorer overnight processing of spatial navigational memory in
cognitively normal elderly. Further, self-reported presence of OSA is associated with greater longitudinal
increase in CSF T-tau and P-tau over 3 years. Although these observations implicate OSA in aberrant memory
processing and regulation of tau in the brain, a causal role for OSA in these processes would be strengthened by
additional analyses. By measuring behavioral readouts of both the encoding and processing of spatial
navigation memory, and quantifying brain tau burden with precise anatomical resolution by adding tau PET
brain imaging at baseline and 2.5 years later in 60 asymptomatic, cognitively normal older individuals with a
wide range of OSA severity who are already being followed with polysomnography (PSG), actigraphy, and
structural brain MRI as part of R01AG056031, we can test the expectations that overnight processing of spatial
memory declines longitudinally (Aim 1) and that brain tau burden increases longitudinally (Aim 2) in a way
that is dependent on measured OSA severity. A role for OSA in the metabolism of tau also would be
strengthened by treating OSA with positive airway pressure (PAP). Whereas CSF Aβ42 levels can change in a
matter of hours depending on sleep condition, CSF tau levels are thought to change over several weeks.
Therefore, we aim to examine T-tau and P-tau in CSF and T-tau in plasma prior to treatment and 8 weeks later
in 80 cognitively normal older individuals with OSA and subjective sleepiness prescribed PAP treatment for the
first time at the Mount Sinai Integrative Sleep Center (MSISC). Satisfactory PAP adherence occurs in typically
50% of patients at the MSISC, and we will monitor adherence through downloads from users' machines.
Measuring CSF and plasma tau as a function of PAP adherence serves as the basis for Aim 3."

 The heavy metal cadmium (Cd) is currently ranked 7th on the 2019 US Agency for Toxic Substances and
Disease Registry (ATSDR) and listed as one of Priority Pollutants by US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA). Although intoxication by high levels of Cd exposure is rarely seen nowadays, chronic low levels of Cd
exposure is still a major health concern as Cd is a cumulative metal with an extremely long biological half-life of
10-30 years in human body. Cd exposure has been associated with increased incidence of multiple diseases.
Strikingly, little is known whether chronic Cd exposure would affect the disposition of drugs that are used to treat
diseases. Renal transporter proteins involve in drug disposition by mediating drug transport across tubular cells
and particularly proximal tubules. Coordinated transcellular transport by uptake transporters, such as organic
cation transporters (OCTs) and organic anion transporters (OATs) in the basolateral membrane in concert with
efflux transporters, such as multidrug and toxin extrusion proteins (MATEs) and multidrug resistance-associated
proteins (MRPs) in the apical membrane of tubular cells, is believed to be an essential system for renal
disposition of cationic and anionic drugs, respectively. Our recent publications and current preliminary results
indicate a broad effect by chronic Cd exposure on renal transporters including OCTs, MATEs, OATs and MRPs.
However, the detail mechanism of transporter regulation by Cd and its broad impact on drug disposition and
response remain to be illustrated. We hypothesize that chronic Cd exposure could alter renal transporter
function, resulting in alteration in drug disposition and toxicity in the kidney. To test this hypothesis, we propose
to conduct research with three specific Aims. Firstly, by using a variety of cellular and molecular assays, along
with proteomic approach, we will uncover a molecular mechanism by which chronic Cd exposure enhances the
translocation of OCT and OAT uptake proteins from the cytoplasmic pool to cell membrane and consequently
increase the cellular accumulation of small molecules that are the substrates of these transporters (Aim 1). Most
clinical used drugs are either organic cations or organic anions. We then propose to demonstrate the impact of
Cd exposure on the disposition of cationic drugs by investigating the effects of Cd exposure on OCT and MATE
expression in mouse kidney tissues and human renal cells, and particularly the impact on cisplatin disposition
and nephrotoxicity using Oct1/2- and Mate1-deficinet mice (Aim 2). Lastly, the effects of chronic Cd exposure
on expression of the anionic drug transporters OATs and MRPs will be characterized in mouse kidney tissues
and human renal cells, and specifically Cd impact on the disposition and nephrotoxicity of the antiviral tenofovir
will be studied with Oat1/3-, Mrp4-deficient mice and OAT pharmacological inhibition (Aim 3). Successful
completion of this project will provide a foundation to uncover environmental Cd as a previously unrecognized
factor for the broad variation in drug disposition and response, contributing to a better drug theray."

Alcohol use disorders frequently have a pediatric origin. Pediatric primary care offices, where the majority of
adolescents receive health care, are a promising venue for early identification and intervention through
universal screening and brief counseling. However, while the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
recommends primary care-based alcohol screening and brief intervention for adults, it found insufficient
evidence to recommend it for adolescents. The goal of the proposed study is to address this evidence gap by
testing the effectiveness of a promising computer-facilitated Screening and Brief Intervention (cSBI) system for
delivery by pediatric primary care clinicians to adolescents at well-visits. This cluster-randomized controlled
trial will be conducted in the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) Pediatric Research in Office Settings
(PROS) national primary care practice-based research network. PROS has demonstrated success in >30
years of practice-based research, with >600 practices participating in recent studies. Drawing on more than 15
years of our prior research on adolescent alcohol screening and brief counseling in primary care offices, the
cSBI system was developed to provide a time-efficient and feasible way for pediatric practices to improve both
the frequency and quality of alcohol screening and counseling. cSBI includes: 1) computer self-administered
screening that adolescents complete prior to seeing their clinician, 2) computer-delivered personalized
feedback to the adolescent, 3) 10 interactive psychoeducational pages for the adolescent on substance use
health risks, 4) a Clinician Report Form with screen results and prompts that clinicians use to provide
motivational interviewing-based individualized counseling, and 5) clinician training materials and protocol. In
our New England-based pilot study, we found that, compared to usual care (UC), the cSBI approach: 1)
increased patient receipt of alcohol-related counseling during well-visits; 2) improved patients' ratings of the
quality of their clinician encounter; and 3) among those who reported past-year use at baseline (n=192), was
associated with a 34% lower risk of a heavy episodic drinking episode during 12 months follow-up. cSBI also
reduced risk of riding with an impaired driver, a major safety risk associated with alcohol, by 42% among those
with prior riding risk. A larger RCT of this approach, which employs an adequately-powered sample and tests
generalizability of effects beyond New England, is needed. We propose to randomize >30 pediatric primary
care clinicians in 10 practices nationwide to deliver UC or cSBI (1:1) to their eligible and assenting 14- to 17-
year-old patients arriving for well-visits. Our aims are to test cSBI's effect on heavy episodic drinking, and on
riding with an impaired driver/driving while impaired, during 12 months follow-up among 1,268 adolescents
screen-identified as at-risk. If effective, cSBI dissemination could leverage existing AAP platforms including
education, teaching, and advocacy, to its 67,000 pediatrician members, greatly increasing the potential for
population-level impact of alcohol screening and brief intervention for U.S. adolescents."

This application is for a Mechanistic Clinical Study (R01) entitled “Prevention of HF with IL-1 blockade: a
mechanistic study” submitted by Antonio Abbate MD, PhD and Benjamin Van Tassell, PharmD. Despite
improvements in early diagnosis and treatment, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains a
leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. Patients with STEMI are significantly increased risk for
developing heart failure. While numerous studies have identified inflammation as a risk factor for heart failure,
there are currently no anti-inflammatory therapies with a documented benefit in patients with STEMI. Among the
different inflammatory mediators, Interleukin-1 (IL-1) occupies a central role, not only because it is a key mediator
of systemic inflammation (i.e. fever) but also because IL-1 is sufficient to cause significant depression of cardiac
function, impaired cardiac reserve, and worsened cardiac remodeling in acute myocardial infarction. In a recent
study, treatment with anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist) in patients with STEMI significantly blunted
the acute systemic inflammatory response and fewer patients treated with anakinra developed heart failure
during the following year. This application will confirm and expand these findings by studying the mechanism by
which IL-1 blockade with anakinra may prevent heart failure. We propose the IL-1 blockade with anakinra
preserves cardiorespiratory fitness through cardiac diastolic/systolic reserve, affecting quality of life, and
incidence of heart failure in patients with STEMI. We propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, phase II clinical trial (n=84) with 1:1 allocation to anakinra or placebo for 14 days among patients with
acute STEMI and state-of-the-art cardiopulmonary exercise testing, cardiac imaging with Doppler
echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance, biomarkers and quality of life assessments up to 12 months."

There is strong and consistent evidence for an association between obesity and post-menopausal breast
cancer; however, the exact mechanisms are not clear. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) increases with
menopause, concomitant with increased adiposity, particularly visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Recent
preclinical data suggests that FSH may drive the deleterious shift in adiposity, independent of estrogen (E2).
Further, FSH receptors are now known to be expressed in breast tumors. To date, there have been no large-
scale human investigations of these FSH-adiposity-breast cancer associations. Using the Women's Health
Initiative (WHI), a long-term national epidemiologic study of postmenopausal women, we will test the
hypothesis that FSH drives adiposity postmenopausally, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Large
subsets of WHI participants completed repeat dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, and therefore
have available robust measures of adiposity (including a novel measure of VAT) and banked serum from the
randomized hormone therapy trials (N=1400) and the observational study (OS; N=1499). Second, using a
case-control design, we will test the hypothesis that higher baseline FSH levels associate with increased risk of
breast cancer using adjudicated cancer incidence data spanning >25 years follow-up (N=785 cases; N=2510
non-cases). Further, we will determine whether adiposity mediates the FSH-breast cancer risk associations.
For all analyses, we will account for exogenous HT use (conjugated equine estrogen ± medroxyprogesterone
acetate or reported HT use in the OS), endogenous estrogen (E2), and adipose-derived hormones that directly
or indirectly regulate FSH (e.g. leptin). Our study is the first comprehensive epidemiologic investigation of FSH
and obesity to measure and study FSH levels in the years prior to breast cancer diagnosis to assess the
potential role of FSH in breast cancer. This study, which includes rich hormone and body composition data will
enable immediate translation to more precise breast cancer prevention interventions aligned with new
medications in the pipeline or currently in use for other cancers and osteoporosis, such as FSH and FSH
receptor modulators, upstream GnRH antagonists (e.g. goserelin), and estetrol (E4)."
10806358,"Although the accumulation of Aβ and subsequent chronic inflammation and neuronal
dysfunction likely contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and clinical
manifestation, the mechanisms for AD initiation and progression in sporadic, late-onset cases
remain unclear. An abundance of pathological and genetic evidence points towards a role of the
endolysomal network and its effects on APP trafficking and processing as a potential initiator of the
disease.
 We recently found that tetraspanin CD151 restrains the releases of i) APP, ii) α-secretase,
and iii) pro-inflammatory molecules. Our recent studies also show that CD151 sustains proper
structure and function of endolysosomes, e.g., supporting proper turnover of proteins in
endolysosomes. These observations underline a putative mechanistic connection between
dysregulated endolysosome function, resulting from the diminished CD151 level in inflammation
and aging, and abnormal processing of APP, leading to chronic inflammation and AD. This notion
forms the basis of our hypothesis for this research project, i.e., CD151-dependent endolysosome
trafficking is required for proper degradation and limited release of APP.
 The goal of this project is to understand the mechanistic roles of CD151-regulated
endolysosomal proteolysis in the pathogenesis of AD. Specifically, we will assess both in vitro and
in vivo effects of CD151 removal on the i) endolysosomal trafficking and/or processing of APP and/or
its relevant secretases, ii) secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules, and iii) AD-related pathological
and behavior changes.
 From these in-depth mechanistic studies, we will understand if and how CD151-dependent
regulation of endolysosomes is important for the progression of AD, likely establish a novel
paradigm between molecular identity of endolysosomes and proteolytic determination of APP, and
possibly delineate the molecular switch that governs the Aβ deposition in brain. At the end of this
project, we will develop an integrated understanding of the unique features of endolysosome and
tetraspanin CD151 in the pathogenesis of AD, which will ultimately lead to the development of
therapeutic strategies against AD."

Many deadly cancers show mutations in a pathway driven by forms of cyclin D, Cdk4 or Cdk6, their inhibitory
proteins, the Rb retinoblastoma protein, and the E2F transcription factors. These include breast cancer,
melanoma, head and neck cancer, esophageal and pituitary cancers. We know that Rb suppresses E2F
transcription factors to control genes critical for cell proliferation, but Rb also has transcription-independent
activities that impact cell division and survival. Considerable interest is driven by the clinical efficacy of the
cyclin D/Cdk4 inhibitor palbociclib, suggesting that additional components of this pathway may be targets of the
inhibitor, or that new targets may reside within the pathway. Despite proteomic work identifying proteins that
associate with pathway components, the key molecular effectors and regulators of the Rb pathway and protein
post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate these factors remain unclear. Here we will focus first on
systematically identifying (1) the proteins, PTMs, and signal dependencies observed during G1/S progression;
(2) identifying which pathway components respond to Palbociclib by shotgun and phosphoproteomics; (3)
defining nuclear and cytoplasmic regulated complexes for Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and Rb/E2F components; (4)
building protein interaction networks to link PTMs to protein interactions and activity; (5) determining the
specificity of interactions among paralogs of the Cdk4/6, Cyclin D1/2/3, Rb and E2F components; and (6)
identifying TCGA cancer lesions found within components of this pathway. These measurements and
perturbations performed by the Proteomics Core will be assembled into a network of PTMs and protein-protein
interactions (PPIs), driving new hypotheses for this critical cancer pathway."

Polypharmacy (PP), or the concurrent use of multiple medications, affects up to 92% of older adults with
cancer. It has been associated with adverse outcomes in these patients including poor adherence to and
tolerance of cancer therapy, decrease in physical functioning, unplanned hospitalizations, falls, increased
symptoms, and lower survival. “Deprescribing,” or the planned discontinuation of medications which may be
potentially unsafe or inappropriate, is an intervention strategy which has the potential to decrease PP and
improve outcomes. Deprescribing has not been studied in older adults with cancer receiving chemotherapy.
Given the association of PP with reduced relative dose intensity (RDI) of chemotherapy, a ratio of dosing
received to standard dosing, a deprescribing intervention could improve RDI in older adults with cancer
receiving curative-intent chemotherapy; RDI of chemotherapy is a predictor of survival in these patients. This
proposal presents a five-year research and career development plan focused on investigating both the
preliminary efficacy and the optimal implementation of deprescribing interventions in older adults with PP and
curable cancers. The candidate, Dr. Erika Ramsdale, is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of
Rochester and is board-certified in both Oncology and Geriatric Medicine. This proposal builds upon her prior
work demonstrating that PP is prevalent in older adults receiving chemotherapy and that a pharmacist-led
deprescribing intervention is feasible to implement in an oncology clinic with high patient satisfaction. The aims
of the proposed study are: 1/adapt and refine potentially scalable deprescribing interventions; 2/investigate the
effects of deprescribing interventions on RDI and other adverse outcomes in older adults undergoing curative-
intent chemotherapy, and 3/identify barriers and facilitators of deprescribing interventions for patients,
oncologists, and pharmacists. Focus groups and interviews with pharmacists, oncologists, nurses, primary
care providers, and patient advocates will allow initial adaptation of the proposed interventions. A “pre-pilot”
cohort of 8 patients with PP and cancer planned to receive curative-intent chemotherapy will undergo a
pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention with additional iterative adaptations. Then, 72 patients will be
allocated to a pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention versus patient education intervention in a cluster-
randomized trial of 12 oncologist clusters. The proposal describes a comprehensive mentorship and training
plan to develop complementary skills in clinical trial design, implementation science, and data science
(encompassing informatics and statistics). Under the guidance of her primary mentor Dr. Supriya Mohile, co-
mentors Dr. Gary Morrow, Dr. Lisa Zubkoff, and Dr. Holly Holmes, and advisors Dr. Sally Norton and Dr. Martin
Zand, she will advance her skills in these areas with the long-term goal of becoming an independent cancer
care delivery researcher implementing and testing multi-level interventions, including technology interventions,
to address polypharmacy in older adults with cancer."

The purpose of this proposed Mentored Research Scientist Career Development (K01) Award is to
support the Candidate’s long-term career goal of leading a research program to elucidate sex-specific
vascular contributions to AD and related dementias (ADRD) by applying the most cutting-edge assess-
ments of cerebrovascular integrity and advanced epidemiologic methods. Whether there are sex differ-
ences in the cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD)-to-Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiological cas-
cade is currently unknown. The first aim of this proposal is to test for sex differences in tissue-based
cSVD markers, Aβ, tau, and the cSVD-AD pathway. The second aim is to evaluate the role of vessel-
based cSVD markers, measured by ultra-high field MRI, in the AD cascade and whether there are sex-
related differences. To successfully achieve the Candidate’s career development goals and research
objectives, the proposed K01 Award builds upon the Candidate's training in population neuroscience
of aging and state of the art methods of ultra-high field small vessel imaging in older adults and adds
four key areas of new training in addition to career and leadership development: 1) cohort harmoniza-
tion methods; 2) causal inference methods to address external validity of highly selected study samples;
3) PET neuroimaging of AD pathology; and 4) sex and gender effects on cerebral pathophysiology of
AD. This proposal incorporates several innovations that will allow the Candidate to better assess the
importance of cSVD for sex differences in the AD biomarker cascade in the population at large: 1)
application of state-of-the-art ultra-high field MRI to obtain direct vessel measures of early cSVD and
2) use of innovative neuroimaging harmonization and causal inference analytic approaches to over-
come the “catch 22” obstacle that typical neuroimaging biomarker studies are not high in external va-
lidity, but collecting neuroimaging in large, population representative cohorts is typically not feasible.
The application is also innovative in relation to the current theoretical framework guiding AD research,
testing boundaries of the extant dynamic AD biomarker model which does not include cerebrovascular
biomarkers. Achieving these training and research objectives will support the Candidate's development
as an independent investigator and a leader in sex-specific trajectories of AD. Ultimately, the Candi-
date’s broader career goal is to develop an impactful research program which identifies sex-specific
intervention targets and improves the lives of older men and women."

Non-AIDS defining cancers (NADCs) are projected to account for 89% of all cancers among people living with
HIV (PLWH) by 2030, with the vast majority diagnosed among older PLWH. This shift is concerning because,
as compared to people without HIV, PLWH reportedly have higher cancer-specific mortality for several NADCs,
and higher overall mortality after diagnosis of the most common NADCs. The explanation for higher mortality
among PLWH after a NADC is likely multifactorial and, at present, not fully understood. Given approximately
45% of PLWH are 50 years, with 84% of those between 50 and 64, it is critical to understand the intersection
between HIV, NADCs, and healthy aging in this population. To inform the development of effective NADC
prevention and treatment strategies for the aging PLWH population, it is important to be able to disentangle the
influence of HIV from the socio-behavioral factors associated HIV acquisition. To do this, a comparison group
with a comparable burden of risk factors, socioeconomic status, and access to care is needed. Approximately
40% of PLWH in the US are covered by Medicaid. Medicaid beneficiaries are a diverse population, and include
a comparison group for PLWH with similar risk factor burden and access to care. The Medicaid population is
an important complement to existing HIV resources, including those that (1) capture cancer incidence but not
downstream events, such as the HIV-Cancer Match cohort, (2) include rich cohort data, but have limited
specific types of cancer cases to allow for examining race and sex differences, like the NA-ACCORD, and (3)
other claims-based cohorts which capture, important, but different segments of the HIV and general population,
including SEER-Medicare. We propose to assess claims for more than 5 million Medicaid beneficiaries 50
years old from 14 states between 2001 and 2017, in the modern era of antiretroviral therapy, to: (1) quantify
the age-, race/ethnicity-, and sex- specific incidence of NADCs by cancer type among PLWH (2) evaluate the
association between HIV-infection and NADC-specific treatment-related outcomes, (3) evaluate the association
between NADC-specific diagnosis and new AIDS-defining illnesses and retention in HIV care, and (4) evaluate
whether a diagnosis of both HIV and NADC, by cancer type, is associated with a higher risk of age-related
outcomes as compared a diagnosis of HIV or NADC alone. Findings from this study will inform how aging in
the presence of HIV affects the risk and consequences of non-AIDS defining cancers, and impacts HIV care
and age-related outcomes among older adults. Importantly, we will evaluate our aims among a low-income,
diverse population of men and women 50 years old with a comparison population with comparable risk factors
and access to care."

Treatment with chemotherapeutic agents can have lasting effects not only on female fertility, but
also on normal hormonal homeostasis, by triggering premature menopause. Chemotherapeutics
can be particularly devastating to girls who are too young to have embryo or egg freezing as a
fertility-preserving option. Currently no treatment exists which can both protect the ovaries in
situ, and maintain long-term hormonal function. We have recently demonstrated that Mullerian
Inhibiting Substance (MIS) is a powerful ovarian suppressant which can protect both the ovary
and the uterus against the damages of chemotherapy. However, the mechanisms of protection
of these organs by MIS remain unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand how
chemotherapy damages fertility, and which protective pathways are elicited by MIS in the ovary
and uterus. These discoveries could facilitate the development of novel drugs that can protect
both fertility and endocrine function in female patients undergoing chemotherapy. We
hypothesize that MIS, or agonists of its receptor, can protect the ovarian reserve, prevent
uterine dystocia, and reduce the risk of premature ovarian insufficiency associated with
chemotherapy. Our rationale is that MIS is the only known hormone capable of blocking
primordial follicle activation, and thus understanding this pathway could identify an entirely new
class of therapeutic targets. Our specific aims will test the following hypotheses: 1) that MIS
protects the ovary from chemotherapy by inhibiting primordial follicle activation and granulosa
cell apoptosis; 2) that MIS prevents uterine labor dystocia caused by doxorubicin by modulating
uterine tissue repair; and 3) that newly identified agonists of the MIS receptor can be shown to
preserve fertility in mice treated with chemotherapy.
The proposed studies represent a significant contribution to our understanding of the
mechanisms of action of MIS in fertoprotection, with a potential for significant clinical impact.
Furthermore, they will provide novel insights into the mechanism of follicle dormancy, one of the
greatest remaining mysteries of reproductive biology. These studies are highly innovative by
providing for the first time a comprehensive assessment of how chemotherapy damages the
ovary and uterus at the single cell resolution through the use of single cell transcriptomics.
Thus, MIS and its small molecule analogs may provide a novel paradigm of a contraceptive that
can protect both ovarian and uterine function in female patients undergoing chemotherapy."

Chronic pain affects over 25 million adults in the United States and is a major cause of disability. Currently
available pain treatments such as opioids are often ineffective and associated with unacceptable side effects
including respiratory depression and addiction. A major goal for new pain therapeutics is to inhibit the sensory
neurons which transmit pain signals (nociceptors) selectively without affecting other neurons involved in
innocuous sensation or the central nervous system. However, nociceptor-specific therapeutic approaches
remain in their infancy. Viral-based gene therapy offers several attractive advantages in treating refractory pain,
as viruses can be engineered to deliver a wide range of molecules, can be administered locally or systemically,
and have been recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for a number of indications. However,
nociceptor-specific viral tools do not presently exist in large part due to the extraordinary heterogeneity of sensory
neurons that has made it difficult to identify molecular features that are unique to these cells. Recent advances
in single-cell genomics have enabled us to generate a cell atlas that describes the genes that are selectively
expressed in mouse and human nociceptors. This proposal aims to uncover the endogenous gene regulatory
elements that mediate nociceptor-specific gene expression patterns and engineer these elements into barcoded
adeno-associated viral libraries. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Mapping
nociceptor-specific gene regulatory elements in mouse and human and 2) Generation of a nociceptor-specific
AAV toolkit. The nociceptor-specific viruses we develop in this proposal will be immediately useful to the scientific
community for accessing nociceptors in wild-type mice and likely other species. In addition, because we will
prioritize gene regulatory elements that are conserved between mouse and human nociceptors, we are optimistic
that the viruses we screen in mice will also drive nociceptor-specific gene expression in humans. These next
generation nociceptor-specific gene therapies would be ideally suited for treating certain refractory pain disorders
because they can be administered locally to neuropathic sensory ganglia through standard outpatient procedures
and can be engineered to drive expression of ion channels that silence nociceptor activity only in the presence
of a specific drug (chemogenetics). This opioid-free approach could have significant translational applications
for patients with refractory chronic pain who often have no other options for relief."
10809578,"Cardiometabolic diseases affect millions of people worldwide and have numerous underlying risk factors. Commensal microbes that comprise the intestinal microbiome are implicated in the progression and onset of many of these diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis. Gut microbes have extensive metabolic capabilities, allowing them to produce or modify molecules that influence disease risk. Members of the gut microbiota have been known to convert cholesterol into the poorly absorbable metabolite coprostanol for almost 100 years, however the microbial genes responsible for this metabolism were not known. In recent work, we analyzed paired gut metagenomic and metabolomic data to identify a novel group of cholesterol dehydrogenases that metabolize cholesterol when expressed in vitro. Using clinical and metagenomic data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), we observed lower serum cholesterol in subjects whose microbiomes encode these cholesterol dehydrogenases. The cholesterol dehydrogenases we originally described convert cholesterol to cholestenone and coprostanone to coprostanol, and we have since identified the intermediate enzyme that converts cholestenone to coprostanone. In this proposal, we will functionally characterize metabolism of sterols in the gut and determine the impact of this process on cardiometabolic disease. In Aim 1, we will identify determinants of host-microbe interactions by collecting and analyzing clinical variables with stool and serum samples from the Gen3/Omni2 FHS cohorts. We will generate coupled stool and serum metabolomics and metagenomics datasets, perform culturomics to assemble a microbial strain library, and identify host exposomes from clinical data. We will then utilize these data to identify and prioritize microbially- derived or modified circulating metabolites associated with CVD for further mechanistic investigations. In Aim 2, We will couple bioinformatics with microbiology and biochemistry for targeted identification of enzymes/proteins that alter sterol structures. This effort will allow us to probe the diversity of gut microbial sterol metabolizing enzymes and their substrates in order to determine specific microbes and genes with the capacity to modify cholesterol. Taking a systems-level approach, we will colonize mice with cholesterol-metabolizing microbial communities to determine how microbial metabolism modulates serum cholesterol and pathways central to cardiovascular disease. In Aim 3, we will functionally link microbiome enzyme activity to sterol metabolism and metabolic disease. We will employ cell-based transcriptional and proteomic assays to interrogate the effects of microbially-modified sterols on local sterol sensing pathways in epithelial cells and measure the effects of circulating sterol metabolites on human immune cells."
10810946,"Project Summary/Abstract
Child maltreatment is a serious problem in the U.S. and worldwide. An estimated 1 in 7 children are maltreated
each year, and most recent annual U.S. data suggest that over 618,000 child maltreatment cases were
substantiated. Approximately 30% of substantiated child and protectice services (CPS) cases lead to child
removal from the home and placement in foster care. Support networks, or safety nets, are a protective factor
associated with child abuse prevention. Research shows that, among vulnerable families in the general
population, strong safety nets, including informal and formal supports, are important because they protect
against risks and benefit parental health, parenting practices, and child wellbeing. Despite the documented
importance of safety nets for vulnerable families, we know much less about the safety nets of families involved
with CPS. Importantly, safety nets may work differently for CPS involved families (e.g., social isolation is a
characteristic of parents involved with CPS, parental lack of engagement in formal supports also is a
documented issue). Not understanding how informal and formal safety nets potentially complement or clash
with one another may contribute to less than desirable outcomes for families involved with CPS (e.g.,
inconsistent participation in services, child removal from the home). Given the potential protective power of
safety nets, not knowing how safety nets function specifically for families involved with the CPS is a significant
gap because we spent over $33.0 billion U.S. federal, state, local dollars on child protective services in the last
fiscal year. With a sample of families involved with the U.S. CPS, this project will identify: (a) parents’ informal
and formal supports (i.e., safety nets) over time; (b) how their safety nets are linked with child outcomes; and
(c) the extent to which their safety nets uniquely, additively, and interactively influence the longitudinal
outcomes of youth involved with CPS. This is important because parental engagement in intervention services
upon CPS involvement is key for positive family outcomes, yet we know very little about the combination of
informal and formal supports—and each have strengths and limitations. This project innovatively applies safety
net frameworks developed with low-income, vulnerable but non-CPS involved families, to families involved with
CPS. Results will move the field forward by filling an important research gap, and direct evidence-based shifts
in child welfare practices by identifying how safety nets function over time and with what results."

Almost half of all people receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder discontinue treatment within the first
year, due to substance use and medication stigma and other recovery challenges such as stress, emotional
dysregulation, and social isolation. We aim to improve retention in buprenorphine treatment through a
smartphone-delivered, stigma-informed recovery support intervention. We propose to develop embodied
conversational agents (ECA), i.e., animated computer agents that simulate natural and intuitive face-to-face
conversations, proven successful in several clinical trials in assisting people with health-related challenges.
Intervention participants will be engaged to interact with the ECA and maximize its uptake so that they can
better cope with stigma, stay connected with recovery services and continue to receive buprenorphine.
The ECA will deliver an acceptance-based intervention originating in cognitive-behavioral therapy, delivering a
combination of didactic components, educational stories, experiential activities, motivational interviewing and
mindfulness exercises to help participants overcome negative thoughts and emotions related to internalized
substance use and intervention stigma. ECA activities will be based on our recently completed acceptance-
based stigma intervention, shown to increase care engagement of people with opioid use disorder. In
instances where participants experience a crisis with increased relapse risks, a clinic dashboard will generate
staff alerts prompting clinician outreach. In year one, we will co-design and pilot-test the ECA system involving
10 OBAT patients. Guided by usability engineering and health stigma frameworks, we will design ECA
activities and the clinic dashboard to help people on MOUD respond more effectively to manifestations of
stigma and build recovery capital. In years 2 and 3, we will conduct a multi-arm 3:1 randomized, controlled pilot
study, enrolling 100 people initiating buprenorphine treatment in three intervention subgroups of 25 participants
each. Intervention group participants will be engaged in ECA use with different strategies to maximize uptake
and compared to 25 control participants receiving usual care at the BMC office–based addiction treatment
clinic. We will estimate the ECA’s effects for the primary outcome of retention in buprenorphine treatment 12
months post randomization, assessed for all intervention participants vs. control participants and pairwise for
each of the three subgroups vs the control group separately. Similarly, we will assess the intervention’s effects
on adherence to buprenorphine and opioid use at 6 and 12 months; and on changes in stigma and recovery
capital scores (exploratory outcomes). This project will also test processes, instruments, and interactions
between users, the system and the OBAT clinic, informing a subsequently planned R01 hybrid type
implementation and effectiveness RCT. By addressing stigma and recovery challenges, this intervention can
help improve buprenorphine treatment retention and support long-term recovery from opioid-use disorder."

Forty-two percent of older adults have one or more physical limitations performing daily tasks that are essential
for maintaining independence in the community. Age-related weakness is an important contributor to physical
impairments, as weakness predisposes older adults to a 4-fold increase in physical limitations. For decades,
age-related weakness was largely attributed to the loss of muscle mass, but recent data indicates that mass
plays a lesser role than originally thought, highlighting that other neurological and/or muscle quality related
factors are critical in the development of weakness. Despite the significance of maintaining physical strength in
aging, the majority of the research has focused on maintaining muscle mass. Considerably less is known
regarding the neural mechanisms potentially contributing to age-related weakness. This knowledge gap
represents a barrier to the development of new interventions to enhance strength and function in older adults.
In this application we will test the central hypothesis that age-related weakness is due, in part, to upregulation in
motor neuron (MN) SK channels (small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels) that results in type-
dependent reductions in intrinsic MN excitability and firing rates. Prior work indicates that aging results in reduced
number of MUs (the α-MN and the muscle fibers that it innervates) and lower firing rates. However, prior work
has stopped short of determining whether age-related reductions in MU numbers are related to clinically-
meaningful weakness, and determining the ionic mechanisms underlying reduced MN firing rates in aging. In
this application we propose a series of parallel, cross-sectional and longitudinal animal (Aims 1 and 2) and
human experiments (Aim 3) to test our central hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine if MN excitability dysfunction is
involved in age-related weakness and determine its temporal relationship to MU loss in mice. Aim 2 will identify
the cellular mechanisms underlying MN excitability dysfunction in aged mice. Aim 3 will determine the role of MN
excitability and number in clinically-meaningful, age-related weakness in older adults. This work aligns with
stated goals from the National Institute on Aging (NIA). The knowledge to be gained from this work has the
potential to fundamentally shift the fields of sarcopenia and frailty research towards MN excitability as an early
biomarker for the development of weakness, and identifying key MN ion channels that could serve as a
neurotherapeutic targets for treating or preventing age-related weakness."
10813077,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Progressive myoclonus epilepsy type 7 (EPM7) is due to a recurrent pathogenic variant in the gene KCNC1,
which encodes the voltage-gated potassium (K+) channel subunit Kv3.1. EPM is a class of devastating
conditions defined by onset of tremor, seizures, and ataxia in a previously normal child or young adult, with
relentless deterioration to wheelchair dependency as well as epilepsy and myoclonus. Further research is
required to clarify the functional role of Kv3 channels in normal brain function and how genetic variation in KCNC1
leads to EPM7 and other forms of neurological disease, so as to facilitate progress towards novel therapies,
preventative measures, or cure. Such insights may prove generalizable to other forms of EPM, which remains a
class of untreatable and incurable disorders.
This 5-year collaborative application employs a comprehensive approach and newly-generated tools to test the
hypothesis that the clinical phenotype of EPM7 is due to loss of Kv3.1 function, leading to the selective
dysfunction of Kv3.1-expressing fast-spiking neurons in discrete locations throughout the brain. Targeted
pharmacologic modulation of Kv3 channels with a potent, specific Kv3 activator will recover cellular and synaptic
abnormalities of Kv3.1-expressing neurons, leading to decreased susceptibility to seizure and improvement in
cerebellar dysfunction in an experimental model of EPM7.
Proposed experiments will determine the relationship between specific KCNC1 variants, physiology, and clinical
phenotype (mild intellectual disability with/without epilepsy; EPM7; or severe early-onset myoclonic epileptic
encephalopathy) in a large cohort of human patients with KCNC1-related neurological disorders compiled by the
applicant. To link KCNC1 variants to ion channel dysfunction, we will compare the biophysical properties of
normal Kv3 K+ channels to channels containing variant Kv3.1 subunits, as well as the ability of a novel Kv3-
specific pharmacological agent to normalize pathological channel activity (Aim 1). The impact of variant KCNC1
on the intrinsic excitability and synaptic and circuit function of Kv3.1-expressing neurons will be pursued using a
new mouse model of EPM7 generated by the applicant (Kcnc1-R320H/+ mice, which recapitulate the core clinical
phenotype seen in humans) (Aim 2). Then, we will attempt to ameliorate disease pathology via administration
of targeted therapeutics in vivo (Aim 3).
Results will provide novel information as to the role of Kv3.1 in cellular, synaptic, and circuit function and define
the pathogenic mechanisms of KCNC1-related neurological disorders towards development and implementation
of novel, targeted therapies in human patients."

 As a naturally existing amber suppression system, the pyrrolysine (Pyl) incorporation machinery has turned
into an enormous tool for undergoing amber suppression-based noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) mutagenesis
in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. By ectopically expressing tRNAPyl and pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase
(PylRS) or a PylRS mutant that charges tRNAPyl with an ncAA, about 200 ncAAs have been genetically encoded
by the amber codon in various cells. As one of the original pioneers in the research field of engineering the Pyl
system for the genetic incorporation of ncAAs, the PI’s group has contributed more than one third of the total
encoded ncAAs. These ncAAs contain a large variety of functionalities, allowing a myriad of applications in both
academia and industry possible. After more than a decade of engineering the Pyl system for the ncAA
incorporation, the field is now able to use the Pyl system-based ncAA mutagenesis technique to conduct grand
explorations to address fundamentally important biological questions. In the past, the PI’s lab has devised a
variety of ncAA mutagenesis-based approaches for the synthesis of proteins with posttranslational lysine
modifications (lysine PTMs). A novel method that allows direct functionalization of ubiquitin and ubiquitin like
proteins for their conjugation with other proteins has also been developed in the PI’s lab. With all these methods
coming to fruition, the PI’s lab is shifting its research focus to use their developed techniques to study basic and
fundamentally important biological questions. Five specific directions will be pursued. The first direction is to use
the ncAA mutagenesis technique to produce designer nucleosomes (nucleosomes with defined lysine PTMs) for
probing histone lysine sites and PTM types targeted by epigenetic erasers including SIRT6, SIRT7, HDAC1, and
LSD1 (HDAC1 and LSD1 in their native complexes). The second direction is to use reconstituted designer
nucleosomes as probes to enrich their binding partners from cells whose identities can be determined using
mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. The third direction is to conduct cryo-EM analysis of designer
nucleosomes bound with SIRT6, SIRT7, HDAC1, and LSD1 (HDAC1 and LSD1 in their native complexes) to
elucidate the structural basis of the four enzymes in their recognition of targeted lysine sites and PTMs in
chromatin. The fourth direction is to synthesize different triubiquitin isoforms and use them as probes to enrich
binding partners from cells whose identities will be confirmed with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.
The last but not least direction is to synthesize cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), which is a frontline sensor in
human cells that detect double-stranded DNA from pathogens and triggers innate immune responses, with lysine
PTMs and to study the functional roles of lysine PTMs in regulating activity, cellular localization and cellular half-
life of cGAS. A long-term goal of the PI’s research is to push applications of the Pyl system-based ncAA
mutagenesis technique in combination with other chemical biology techniques to enhance basic biological
research."

The goal of this program is to understand how informational signaling proteins that pattern tissues distribute in
space and time during development. We study this process in Drosophila, investigating the Decapentaplegic,
Hedgehog, FGF, EGF, Wg, and Notch-Delta signaling systems. The mechanisms that move these proteins
from their sources and distribute them to their targets involve cellular machines and organelles whose actions
precisely control their movement, and our work has identified novel structures we named “cytonemes” that
mediate their dispersion. This proposal describes the approaches we will take to further characterize
cytonemes and the machines and organelles that make them work.
Cytonemes are specialized filopodia that extend between cells that produce signaling proteins and their
signaling targets. Our work has now established that cytonemes are key elements of paracrine cell-cell
signaling, and their properties led us to propose that signaling proteins move between non-neuronal cells in a
manner similar to the way neurons exchange signals with post-synaptic target cells – by exchanging
information at synaptic contacts that connect cell extensions such as axons that span the distance between
signaling and target cells. Findings made during the current grant period show that both the composition and
activities of cytonemes are remarkably similar to axons and chemical synapses. Cytonemes are constituted
with proteins that have been shown to function and to be required at neuronal synapses, such as the cell
adhesion proteins Capricious and Neuroglian, and are calcium dependent, excitable, and glutamatergic. They
require the glutamate receptor, glutamate transporter, voltage-gated calcium channel, synaptobrevin, and
synaptotagmin. We have also learned that cytonemes have alternating regions of thin and wide diameter akin
to “beads on a string”, and borrow deep into invaginations of target cells. These unexpected properties have
fascinating implications for mechanisms of pathfinding and signal transduction, and the work we propose both
develops new tools for imaging cytonemes and builds upon our previous findings to determine the roles,
composition and functions of these remarkable organelles and this mechanism of contact-based signaling."

This proposal describes a five-year program to investigate the roles of paired-like homeodomain 2 (Pitx2)
signaling during cellular injury response and fibrotic scar formation after myocardial infarction (MI). MI accounts
for millions of deaths worldwide annually. Therefore, developing an effective regenerative therapy is one of the
major goals of modern cardiovascular biology. Pitx2, when overexpressed in cardiomyocytes, is capable of
partially repairing myocardium in a mouse MI model. Pitx2 function is induced and promoted by the upstream
nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (Nrf2), a known regulator of redox balance. Unlike most of the regeneration-
promoting factors that induce cell cycle reentry in cardiomyocytes, the Pitx2 signaling only has a mild effect on
cardiomyocyte proliferation. Instead, Pitx2 regulates the expression of antioxidant scavengers and components
of respiratory chain, both are critical for cell survival and homeostasis. Our Preliminary studies also suggest a
role of Pitx2 in myofibroblast activity and fibrosis formation. Therefore, targeting Pitx2 for therapeutics provides
alternative strategies which focus on cell survival and removing fibrosis. However, an in-depth study of Pitx2 is
needed for designing an efficient targeting strategy. The Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
overexpression of Pitx2 promotes the degradation of Nrf2 by inducing the expression of E3 ubiquitin-protein
ligase Rbx1. This proposed negative feedback loop may promote the degradation of Nrf2, a key factor for the
nuclear translocation and activity of Pitx2. We aim to explain why Pitx2 overexpression in myocardium can only
partially repair the myocardium after MI. Transgenic mice with modified Pitx2 and/or Rbx1 expression will be
subjected to MI to examine the hypothesis. We will also test an improved therapeutic strategy by
overexpressing Pitx2 and Nrf2 simultaneously in infarcted cardiomyocytes. The Specific Aim 2 will focus on the
downstream effects of Pitx2 signaling and test the hypothesis that Pitx2 activity in cardiomyocytes inhibits the
transition of cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts after MI. Preliminary data suggest that Pitx2 signaling in
cardiomyocyte can affect myofibroblast activity. We proposed an interaction between cardiomyocytes and
cardiac fibroblasts, coordinated by Pitx2, that can regulate fibrosis formation after MI. Mouse models with
modified Pitx2 expression and in vitro primary cell cultures will be used to examine how cardiomyocyte-derived
signaling can regulate fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition, myofibroblast migration, and ECM deposition."

The objective of this proposal is to develop and pilot a systems-level strategy in pediatric
primary care to enhance identification and management of suicidal ideation and behavior in
Latinx youth, particularly those in immigrant families with parents who have limited English
proficiency (LEP). We will focus on the use of trained community health workers (CHWs) to
increase clinic capacity and quality of suicide risk screening and early intervention, with a focus
on safety planning, parent psychoeducation and care coordination. Our specific aims are 1: To
develop site-specific implementation protocols for the integration of CHWs into SIB screening
and safety planning for Latinx youth and their families; 2: To pilot the implementation of the
program in a six-month open trial in four pediatric primary care practices representing a range of
usual practice settings; and 3: To engage a stakeholder network to explore barriers and
facilitators, including costs and billing strategies, to implementation of this approach across a
broad range of pediatric primary care settings. In Aim 1, we will use Implementation Mapping, a
systematic process incorporating the perspectives of users (e.g., families), implementers (e.g.,
clinic staff), adopters (e.g. clinic administrators) and sustainers (e.g. healthcare service delivery
experts and payors) to guide development of strategies to adopt, implement and maintain an
evidence-based intervention in the four participating pediatric practices. In Aim 2, we will assess
feasibility, acceptability, and impact on organizational (e.g., increase in screening and CHW
referral, engagement in follow-up mental health visits) and patient-level outcomes (e.g.,
improved family functioning, parenting self-efficacy). Quantitative data (e.g., changes in rates of
screening) will be examined using an interrupted time series analysis. In Aim 3, we will conduct
semi-structured interviews with stakeholders and convene the stakeholder network to develop
an implementation plan for a larger trial. We will then integrate pilot trial and qualitative data
using mixed methods analysis to assess feasibility and acceptability at the organizational,
provider, and patient levels and convene to develop an implementation plan for a larger trial.
Successful completion of this deployment-focused pilot study would prepare us for
a future multi-site cluster randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of the
implementation of suicide prevention interventions delivered by CHWs in health care settings on
rates of suicidal ideation and behavior for Latinx youth in pediatric primary care, with the long-
term goal of addressing mental health service disparities and preventing youth suicide."
10813098,"Our speech is composed of rhythmically timed elements, closely associated with syllables. This
feature is conserved across the animal kingdom, from fish to songbirds to monkeys, suggesting
that the tempo embedded within vocalizations is innately encoded. Indeed, others have
hypothesized that the rhythmicity of sound production is created by hardwired neural circuits in
the brainstem, but evidence to support this theory is lacking.
 Vocalizations are produced by the concerted activity of articulator (laryngeal and tongue)
and breathing muscles. Moreover, vocalizations must seamlessly integrate with or perhaps even
override the breathing rhythm. Given this, we hypothesized, as have others, that if a vocalization
motor patterning system existed, it would be anatomically and functionally connected to the neural
circuits for breathing in the brainstem. We also hypothesized that this same circuit would
intrinsically encode the rhythmicity of syllables within vocalizations. These two concepts - the
ability to autonomously pattern a rhythmic behavior - would define such a neural circuit as a
vocalization central pattern generator ‘CPG’, the first of its kind.
 To discovery this predicted vocalization CPG, we have studied the neural control of innate
murine neonatal cries, which are analogous to the cries of human infants. We found that murine
cries have a stereotyped syllabic structure and motor program. These two features of innate cries
suggest an underlying cry CPG. We have found a novel cluster of several dozen brainstem
neurons that are required to execute cries and premotor to multiple muscles used in vocalizations.
Here, we seek to characterize these neurons to determine if they are indeed a bonified
vocalization CPG. First, we will study if these neurons produce an autonomous oscillation as well
as the connectivity to correctly pattern the activity of muscles used in vocalizing. And then, we will
ectopically activate these neurons to find out if they are sufficient to elicit cries.
 The significance of this proposal is multifold. First-and-foremost, we will identify and
characterize a long-sought vocalization CPG. This forms a foundation to map the brain-wide
circuitry used in innate and learned vocalization. Second, we will determine how the vocalization
and breathing CPGs interact. An intriguing possibility is that our most vital neural circuit that
controls breathing might be overridden. In fact, even how distinct mammalian CPGs cooperate to
produce complex behaviors remains poorly understood. And ultimately, this work will enable
dissection of the mechanisms of speech pathologies in autism spectrum disorders as well as
apraxia, dysarthria, or stutter."

Background: Misinformation on social media, or the sharing of false or incomplete information without intent
to cause harm, is contributing to vaccine hesitancy among parents and impeding uptake of the HPV vaccine
among adolescents in the United States. Innovative communication strategies that can be rapidly developed
and deployed to correct evolving misinformation about HPV vaccine on social media and increase uptake of
HPV vaccine are needed. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that theory-based corrective messages directly
addressing the content of misinformation will improve HPV vaccine series initiation and completion as
compared to general corrective messages and a non-message control group. Proposal: We will efficiently
identify recently circulating misinformation on social media using natural language processing (NLP) methods,
develop and test a theory-based corrective messaging tool using a validated message testing protocol, and
assess the efficacy of the tool on increasing HPV vaccine series initiation and completion among adolescents
in an online, block-randomized controlled trial with three arms and longitudinal follow-up. Participants (n=2500)
will be parents of adolescents ages 8-11 recruited from social media and followed up over a 12-month period.
Importance and Innovation: If successful, in addition to improving HPV vaccination uptake, the methods from
this study have the potential to be adapted to address other forms of misinformation swiftly and efficiently in
public health such as that surrounding COVID19, childhood vaccinations, or cancer prevention and treatment
strategies."
10813735,"Our earlier mechanistic analyses of estrogen action in brain led to the discovery that estrogen is a master
regulator of the bioenergetic system in brain that promotes glucose transport, glucose metabolism,
mitochondrial respiration and ATP generation. Collectively, the data provided compelling evidence for estrogen
as a systems biology metabolic regulator in brain and illuminated compensatory mechanisms consistent with
an aging female brain that is starving. For estrogen to function as master regulator of the bioenergetic system
in the female brain, estrogen must be integrating nuclear and mitochondrial genomic responses. Further from a
systems level perspective, it would be necessary for estrogen to also regulate cytoplasmic signaling
mechanisms for real time feedback on the functional outcomes of nuclear and mitochondrial gene transcription.
The fundamental issues to be investigated are the mechanisms whereby estrogen integrates bioenergetic
responses across two genomic compartments while simultaneously monitoring energetic demand and
performance in real time. The proposed program of research is designed to test two hypotheses. First,
estrogenic control of the bioenergetic system in the female brain requires: 1) both nuclear and mitochondrial
genomes; 2) integration of gene expression across both genomic compartments and 3) activation of rapid
signaling cascades to provide real time feedback on bioenergetic performance. Second, we hypothesize that
loss of estrogen in the aging female brain leads to a systematic dis-integration of estrogenic control of nuclear
and mitochondrial genomes followed by decline in bioenergetic sensing mechanisms. Estrogenic control of the
bioenergetic system of the brain and the dismantling thereof has basic, translational and clinical significance.
From a discovery perspective the proposed program of research is unique in exploring the mechanisms
underlying estrogenic integration of nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression and the real time feedback
mechanisms that control the bioenergetic system of the brain. Further, the process by which this control
system is dismantled in the aging female brain is uncharted territory of high significance for understanding
bioenergetic aging in brain. Translationally, determining the mechanisms underlying the systematic dismantling
of estrogenic integration of bioenergetic compartments in brain has the potential to detect therapeutic targets to
sustain bioenergetic function in the aging female brain. Clinically, the aging transition of menopause, unique to
the female, is a process that dismantles both reproductive ability and potentially bioenergetic capacity in brain.
This is particularly relevant to age-related neurological conditions associated with deficits in glucose
hypometabolism such as Alzheimer's, depression and multiple sclerosis which have greater prevalence in
postmenopausal women. Research proposed herein aligns with NIA Strategic Research Goals A and C and
the “need to better distinguish patterns of brain aging” https://www.nia.nih.gov/about/living-long-well-21st-

During the past few decades, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of oropharyngeal
cancer (OPC), which is attributable to the epidemic of oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
Patients with HPV-positive OPC respond well to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and have a more
favorable prognosis than HPV-negative patients. However, standard treatment is associated with
significant toxicity and likely represents over-treatment for many patients with HPV-positive disease.
Several randomized clinical trials have tested novel deintensification strategies with the goal to
reduce toxicity and improve patients’ quality of life while preserving the high cure rate. These trials
enroll patients based on cancer stage and smoking history. However, current clinical prognostic
factors are rather crude and do not accurately predict disease progression on an individual level.
Reliable prognostic models are critically needed for personalized risk-adaptive therapy of OPC. To
address this unmet need, we propose quantitative CT features to characterize intratumoral spatial
heterogeneity and disease invasion/spread, which are known drivers of treatment resistance and
disease progression. In addition to knowledge-based image features, we will develop complementary
data-driven deep learning models to predict disease progression by using a retrospective multi-
institutional dataset of 1771 patients. Further, we will integrate imaging with clinical data to improve
prediction and establish their validity by rigorous prospective validation in 1780 patients enrolled in 3
randomized clinical trials. Finally, we will employ a radiogenomic approach to elucidate biological
basis of the imaging signatures. If successful, the proposed models will allow more accurate
prediction of prognosis and improve risk stratification of OPC. This has significant therapeutic
implications by optimizing the selection of patients for treatment deintensification, which will increase
the likelihood of success of future clinical trials and pave the way for precision medicine in OPC.
Because the information is derived from standard CT scans, this would be readily integrated into
current clinical workflow, widely applicable to underserved populations in low-resource settings, and
therefore would help reduce health disparity in the US."

Astrocytes are critical regulators of innate immunity in the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulation of CNS
innate immunity by neuroinflammatory activators such as pathogens and brain injury, as well as in response to
neurodegeneration, cause astrocytes to undergo a transition to a reactive phenotype called astrogliosis. While it
is well accepted that astrogliosis can act as a protective mechanism to minimize CNS damage, the mechanisms
that regulate astrogliosis are not well understood. Our preliminary results and data from the literature support
our general hypothesis that PARP7 controlled MARylation critically shapes the innate immune responses in
the CNS. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of PARP7 in astrogliosis and whether PARP7 represents
an actionable target for CNS pathologies that arise as a consequence of activation of CNS innate immunity. The
objective of the proposed work is elucidate the mechanisms by which PARP7 regulates innate immunity in
astrocytes. PARP7 has emerged as a critically important member of a large enzyme family known as PARPs,
especially in the innate immune response. Similar to other PARP family members, PARP7 catalyzes the post-
translational modification known as mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation), which involves the transfer of
ADP-ribose from NAD+ to amino acids on target proteins. The MARylation targets of PARP7 in astrocytes are
unknown. To decode the mechanisms by which PARP7 regulates innate immunity in astrocyte, we need to
identify the direct targets of PARP7 in astrocytes. Identifying the direct targets of PARP7 has been challenging,
however, due to the fact that PARPs share the same substrate NAD+. To overcome this limitation, we describe
the development of engineered PARP7—orthogonal NAD+ analogue pairs for identifying the direct targets of
PARP7 in astrocytes lysates (Aim I). We also describe the generation of membrane-permeant variants of our
orthogonal NAD+ analogues, which are critical for identifying PARP7 targets in intact astrocytes using stimuli
that activate the innate immune response in astrocytes (Aim II). Lastly, we describe a strategy for improving
the selectivity of PARP7 inhibitors (Aim III). Selective inhibitors of PARP7 are essential chemical probes for
evaluating the function of PARP7-mediated MARylation in the innate immune response in astrocytes. We
anticipate that these studies will not only clarify our understanding of the function of PARP7-mediated
MARylation in innate immunity in astrocytes, but could also lead to new therapeutic strategies for CNS
pathologies, particularly neuroinflammatory (e.g. multiple sclerosis) and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g.
Alzheimer's disease). More generally, the results obtained from these studies will have far-reaching impact on our
understanding of MARylation in cell signaling."
10812804,"Heart failure is the leading cause of mortality, and about 6.2 million adults in the United
States have heart failure. Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has
typical heart failure symptoms with mostly diastolic LV dysfunction but preserved
ejection fraction. HFpEF is characterized by pronounced coronary microvascular
dysfunction (CMD), the causal contribution of which is unclear. CMD is associated with
coronary artery diseases (CAD), diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), ischemia with the non-
obstructive coronary artery (INOCA), and HFpEF. Patients with CMD exhibit impaired
acetylcholine-induced endothelial-dependent relaxation. Impaired endothelium-
dependent vasodilation (EDD) decreases coronary blood flow and myocardium perfusion
and might lead to myocardial ischemia even without an obstructive coronary artery. We
hypothesize that the myocardial deficiency perfusion caused by CMD will lead to
myocardial ischemia, diastolic cardiac dysfunction, and fibrosis in HFpEF. So CMD plays
a critical role in HFpEF.
Moreover, our ex vivo study shows a deficiency of miR-21 that restores the NO-
dependent coronary vasodilation. This application will address the underlying
mechanism of how miR-21 regulates the coronary microvascular function, cardiac
function and remodeling in HFpEF in a mouse model of HFpEF induced by a long-term
high fat and high sugar diet. Such a preclinical modelof HFpEF has been validated in our
preliminary data. We hypothesize that restoring “normal” coronary microvascular
function (restoring endothelial-dependent dilation) by modulating miR-21can ameliorate
HFpEF. We will test our hypothesis by an interdisciplinary approach encompassing a
range of approaches and disciplines from molecular and cell analyses, vascular biology
to physiology and pathophysiology, engendering the study of a novel mechanism of
coronary microvascular dysfunction, such as tissue-specific knockouts and lineage
tracing with 3D fluorescent imaging, measurement of vasodilation and myocardial blood
flow in vivo by contrast echocardiography and cardiac function by echocardiography
along with RNA-seq, sc RNA-seq, etc. Completing this project may lead to a new
strategy to treat microvascular dysfunction and HFpEF and improve the cardiovascular
prognosis of HFpEF."
10812578,"SUMMARY
Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in the human body, with a wide range of functions, from locomotion
to breathing, vision, blood pressure control, metabolism, and endocrine regulation. Muscle homeostasis and
regeneration are largely dependent on a small population of stem cells that reside quiescent in the muscle tissue
until activated by a stimulus, typically an injury. Tight regulation of the activation process is essential for tissue
homeostasis: too little activation would impair the tissue’s ability to regenerate in response to damage, while too
much activation could lead to tumor formation or premature depletion of the stem cell pool. Neutrophils attracted
to injured muscle secrete proteolytic enzymes, and we have recently observed that one such enzyme, neutrophil
elastase, appears to promote muscle stem cell activation. Moreover, we have observed that triple knockout of
all three neutrophil serine proteases practically abrogates muscle regeneration in response to acute injury. The
overreaching goal of this proposal is to investigate the physiological function of neutrophil serine proteases in
the muscle stem cell niche and decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms. Specifically, our first aim is to
define how the muscle stem cell niche as a whole (cells, matrix and soluble factors) are affected by loss of each
NSP and all three combined. Our second aim is to identify the molecular mechanisms that are regulated in a
cell-autonomous manner by the NSPs in the context of MuSC activation and first division. Finally, our third and
last aim is to validate in vitro and in vivo the candidate biological functions discovered in aim 1 and 2. In
conclusion, we expect that, in addition to answering the main question of which processes and mechanisms
neutrophil serine proteases regulate during muscle regeneration, and how, the results from this work will provide
a platform for future investigations into how stem cell niches are continuously remodeled by proteases to ensure
prompt and efficient regeneration as well as stem cell and tissue homeostasis."
10814195,"Summary. Our overarching goal is to render therapeutic drug monitoring as convenient and highly time resolved
as the continuous glucose monitor has rendered the monitoring of blood sugar. The realization of this goal would
transform many aspects of both biomedical research and clinical practice. It would, for example, enable
personalized dosing based on a patient’s accurately determined, rather than poorly predicted, drug metabolism,
an outcome of high relevance to the treatment of infectious diseases, which commonly employs drugs of
dangerously narrow therapeutic index, and to improving women’s health, as pharmacokinetic sex differences
lead to a doubling of adverse pharmacotherapeutic outcomes in females. Ultimately such a technology could
enable feedback-controlled drug dosing, which, by responding in real time to metabolic variations, would improve
the safety and efficacy of drugs that suffer from dose-limiting toxicity. To achieve our goal, however, requires
two significant innovations: (1) a technology able to monitor arbitrary drug molecules in situ in the intestinal fluid
(ISF) of the subcutaneous space and (2) vastly improved knowledge regarding how the pharmacokinetics of
drugs in the ISF relate to the pharmacokinetics seen in plasma. Under the prior round of grant funding, we
achieved the first of these necessary advances. Specifically, we demonstrated that minimally-invasive
Electrochemical, Aptamer-Based (EAB) sensors support the seconds-resolved, real-time measurement of drugs
in situ in the plasma (venous), cerebrospinal fluid (brain), and ISF (subcutaneous space) of our live rat animal
model. Here we propose to tackle the second innovation. That is, using intravenous and subcutaneous EAB
sensors we propose to advance understanding of the relationships between plasma and ISF pharmacokinetics
across a diverse set of antimicrobial and immunosuppressant drugs for which therapeutic drug monitoring is an
important element of the standard of care. We believe the resulting orders of magnitude improvement in
measuring these relationships is a critical step towards our long-range goal of rendering high-precision
therapeutic drug monitoring convenient and cost effective."
10814183,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The emotion of fear is a powerful trigger for memory storage, helping us avoid cues associated with aversive
outcomes. However, fear memories become maladaptive and trigger inappropriate emotional responses in
common psychiatric diseases such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder,
and panic disorder. Women are twice as likely as men to experience fear-based psychiatric conditions, and
greater symptom severity leads to poorer quality of life in women with these illnesses. Unfortunately, the
neurobiological mechanisms underpinning this sex difference in susceptibility remain poorly understood due to
a lack of female subjects in preclinical research. By understanding how females encode and express fear
memories differently than males, we will pinpoint sex-specific mechanisms and treatment strategies for fear-
based psychiatric disease. The purpose of this project is to identify the molecular-, cellular-, and circuit-based
mechanisms underlying female susceptibility to fear-based mental illness. Based on preliminary experiments,
this work will focus on the lateral septum (LS), a sexually dimorphic hub of the limbic system known to gate
maladaptive emotional behaviors. We show that the LS is robustly activated during cued threat (also known as
fear) memory formation in females but not males, that this sex-specific activation is causally linked to the
strength of the threat memory, and that neurons of the female LS threat memory ensemble directly project to
regions that drive cue-evoked emotional responses. The experiments proposed in this application will expand
upon these initial findings to test the central hypothesis that female-specific engagement and subsequent
synaptic strengthening of a hitherto unrecognized LS circuit enhances cued threat memory in females versus
males. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that selective recruitment of threat-related LS neurons enhance
threat memory encoding and expression in females versus males through disinhibition of projection neurons of
the hypothalamus, ventral hippocampus, and periaqueductal gray. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that
excitatory projections from the medial prefrontal cortex are necessary and sufficient for LS memory ensemble
recruitment and enhanced memory encoding in females versus males. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test the
hypothesis that sex differences in the molecular architecture of LS neurons drive sex-specific memory
allocation. These experiments have the potential to transform our understanding of how basic brain circuits for
fear memory storage and expression differ between the sexes. Our long-term objective of this work is to help
clinicians uncover novel gender-specific therapeutic targets for fear-based psychiatric disease."
10814490,"ABSTRACT – UCSF E-STaR OVERALL
The aspirations of an integrated Learning Health System (LHS) are to deliver care that is of the highest quality,
is safe, and is optimally efficient. These goals guide all UCSF-affiliated health systems, including UCSF Health,
SF Health Network/Zuckerberg SF General and the SF Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The diversity of
patient populations and delivery systems represented by UCSF-affiliated health systems, along with their
evolution as integrated LHS, is a ripe, natural training environment for developing LHS scientists. To achieve
greater impact, UCSF needs a larger workforce of LHS scientists from diverse backgrounds, working in teams
with clinical operators, data stewards and informaticians, and engaged with multiple stakeholders (patients,
caregivers, clinicians, institutional leadership) to co-produce real-time improvements in practice patterns,
patient-centered outcomes, and health system performance. As an AHRQ/PCORI-sponsored LHS K12 Career
Development Program and LHS Center of Excellence, UCSF has designed an outstanding research training
and career development program for 8 individuals who have already demonstrated an impact. This UCSF E-
STaR Center proposal will create and scale up LHS-specific training and research infrastructure: Aim 1. To
establish multidisciplinary Cores that share resources and facilities with healthcare systems to
support research and training for LHS scientists, particularly in areas of embedded research training,
patient and stakeholder engagement, informatics, and outcome evaluation. The Administrative Core (AC)
will provide overarching Center leadership, stakeholder engagement and coordination, recruitment, program
evaluation, and internal and external communications. The Research Education Core (REC) will implement the
Scholar training program; the Research and Data Analysis Core (RDAC) will provide consultation and services
for study design and analysis, facilitating data access and dedicated IT support; Aim 2. To enroll Scholars
from diverse backgrounds, and provide them with the research, engagement, and leadership skills
necessary to pursue successful careers as LHS scientists. The AC and REC will coordinate recruitment,
training, and retention activities. Performance and outcomes will be captured in the Program Evaluation; Aim
3. To enable embedded research that advances and continuously improves healthcare quality, equity,
and patient-centered outcomes, and to disseminate results locally and nationally. RDAC will implement
processes to systematically ensure patient-centered outcomes are measured, captured, and aggregated
across embedded research projects. Expected Outcomes: At end of 5 years, the UCSF LHS E-STaR Center
will have trained >60 Scholars across at least 6 unique health systems, and provided consultative LHS support
to >100 additional scientists. Their research projects will increase the quality and health outcomes for patients
of all backgrounds, with results disseminated through local health systems, publications in the medical
literature, and presentations at national meetings."
10908460,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling has emerged as a valuable tool in
the drug development process for both novel and generic drug products. In particular,
simulation tools can be utilised for generic drug products to assess virtual bioequivalence
between the reference and test products. Dermal PBPK modelling has been applied to the
development of topical formulations by predicting drug absorption into skin in virtual
populations that are constructed using realistic physiology data. It is important to recognise
that topical products undergo changes immediately upon application due to formulation
metamorphosis, which may alter the critical characteristics of the formulations. To accurately
simulate drug permeation through the skin, precise parameterisation of the dynamic changes
that occur during formulation metamorphosis is crucial. A primary objective of this grant
proposal is to improve the formulation parameterisation integrated in the MPML MechDermA
model by integrating dynamic formulation compositions and feedback to critical quality
attributes using advanced prediction methods. The other primary objective is to systematically
verify the model’s predictive capability by assessing its ability to account for variations in drug
product attributes and to predict the influence of these variations on the local bioavailability.
Specifically, Aim 1 will focus on the enhancement of the formulation toolbox by enabling the
input of complete formulation composition data (Q2) and implementing predictive methods to
estimate formulation Q3 properties based on known Q2 characterisation. The proposed
framework will be used in pursuit of Aim 2, wherein individual volatile constituents will be
allowed to evaporate and dynamic re-calculation of formulation Q2 and Q3 metrics
implemented. In addition to evaporation, the depletion of excipient through skin absorption will
be investigated under Aim 3. Commercial and custom desoximetasone drug products
featuring modified formulation attributes will be designed and characterised under Aim 4.
These formulations will serve as challenges for the PBPK models, which will be used to verify
the models’ ability to differentiate between formulation variations and assess
bio(in)equivalence. Aim 5 will focus on the evaluation of skin hydration following formulation
application involving the development and validation of a PBPK model of skin hydration and
absorption of water from topical drug products. Aim 6 will develop a model for simulating
microdialysis and open-flow microperfusion data; this model will be leveraged to simulate
available data on local concentrations in vivo and further verify local concentration predictions."
10814589,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Research Education Core)
Historically, training programs have not prepared researchers to directly engage in rapid, iterative learning
within a health care system that promotes practice informed by evidence and evidence informed by practice.
Yet, embedding researchers within the walls, teams, and priorities of health systems encourages dialogue
between researchers, clinicians, and administrators, and increases the responsiveness of research to the
needs of practice without sacrificing scientific rigor. The LHS E-STaR of the North (LEaRN) Research
Education Core (REC) will develop scientists capable of strengthening the rigor and application of research
evidence and of improving the implementation of innovative practices in health care organizations. The LEaRN
REC will leverage and expand the infrastructure established under the Minnesota Learning Health System K12
Mentored Career Development Program (MN-LHS) to train a diverse group of LHS scientists who embed
themselves into health care operations and bring value to decision-making processes by conducting rigorous
research responsive to the needs of clinical practices and patients. The MN-LHS has been exceptionally
successful, training 14 LHS scientists (clinicians, clinician investigators, and doctoral-level scholars) from five
healthcare delivery systems and representing primary care, subspecialties, nursing, pharmacy, anthropology,
sociology, engineering, biostatistics, and epidemiology. Substantial institutional support will accelerate the
creation of a community of LHS scientists, ensure that the scientists are exposed to a wider range of questions
emerging from clinical practice, and offer diverse opportunities for authentic embeddedness. The LHS
scientists emerging from the LEaRN Center REC will be prepared to balance the demand for rapidly
generated, practical evidence with the rigors of peer-review and scientific standards, rapidly translating
research to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes. The overarching goals of the LEaRN REC are to
provide 1) tailored educational experiences that leverage an existing, robust educational infrastructure, 2) a
novel competency-based curricula, and 3) health system partners that will serve as learning “labs” for LHS
research, offering unrivaled expertise in training embedded clinical scientists using patient-centered LHS
philosophies and methods. The goals of the LEaRN REC will be achieved by pursuing three aims: leverage
and expand our MN-LHS program, identifying and educating a new generation of embedded LHS scholars for
independent research careers in patient-centered and community engaged research (Aim 1); enhance the
diversity of LHS scientists, their science, and their mentors (Aim 2); and cultivate engagement opportunities to
ensure the LEaRN REC is responsive to the needs of patients, communities, and health systems (Aim 3). The
LEaRN REC will address current gaps in LHS training by supporting research projects designed with system
leaders, patients, and community members. The REC will recruit and train a new generation of deeply
embedded, actively engaged scientists who can leverage state-of-the-art methods for rapid-cycle research to
improve health outcomes of our most vulnerable populations."
10814340,"Summary
 More than 90% of all cancer-related deaths are caused by metastasis, the spread of cancer from its origin.
By the time most cancer metastases become clinically visible, the disease has progressed too far to benefit from
early-stage interventions such as surgery or radiation. Thus, new approaches accessing specific diagnostic
biomarkers are highly desired to improve therapeutic outcomes. Microenvironmental signatures such as
extracellular matrix (ECM) alterations, stromal composition, or immune components exhibit critical determinants
of metastatic dissemination broadly across cancers. Herein, the main goal of this proposal is to converge the
disease hall markers and rational design of biomolecular engineering to develop multidisciplinary approaches
towards precision diagnostics of cancer metastasis. As metastases start to invade, they alter the extracellular
matrix through aberrant proteolytic activities that could be leveraged as biomarkers. The applicant set out to
systematically identify proteases expressed in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) by transcriptomic and
proteomic analysis. To improve the detection sensitivity, it is proposed to integrate the proteolytic activity to
formulate a library of enzyme activated sensors by reengineering the ECM targeting nanobody with
extraordinarily tumor targeting efficacy for maximal on-target signal generation (Aim 1). To optimize the detection
specificity, the multiplexity of these activity-based sensors will be extensively expanded for disease classification
using CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid barcode readout. Preliminary investigation into the in vivo DNA barcodes
revealed that they could be detected noninvasively as a urinary reporter, but could also enable portable detection
on paper (Aim 2). Beyond initial diagnosis, disease stratification and treatment monitoring are critical to
establishing a robust therapy. The novel sensors will thus be evaluated for noninvasive tumor monitoring and
imaging in disease recapitulating metastatic CRC models (Aim 3). Successful completion of these three aims
would offer a tumoral activation responsive, genetically encoded tracking (TARGET) platform can 1) unveil new
biology at the metastasis-specific tumor microenvironment, 2) provide a completely noninvasive way to track
tumor metastasis, and 3) offer a pipeline for validating novel therapies, which are currently unachievable by
single modality agents. This project requires innovative integration across several fields. The candidate has
assembled an exceptional team to help her achieve the goals of technology development and career transition,
including her mentor Dr. Sangeeta Bhatia (MIT, medical engineering) and Drs. Tyler Jacks (MIT, tumor genetics),
Dr. Richard Hynes (MIT, extracellular matrix), Dr. Frank Gertler (MIT, cell motility) and Dr. Shawn Chen (NIH,
theranostics) on the mentoring committee. This training period will allow the candidate to gain experience in
tumor microenvironment network, pre-clinical cancer models and analytical chemistry. In the future, the principles
of this modular platform could apply to other disease areas. The research program here aligns well with the
candidate’s long-term goal to develop multi-scale engineered tools in the context of cancer."
10814590,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Research Data Analysis Core)
Healthcare faces massive disruption due to crises of cost, clinician workforce burnout, and subpar and
inequitable health outcomes. Simultaneously, an ongoing digital transformation promises more continuous,
precise, virtual, and patient-engaged care and possibilities to expedite the translational of scientific discoveries
directly into healthcare. Based upon the learning health system (LHS) critical priority areas identified by the
National Academy of Medicine Leadership Consortium Action Collaborations for an LHS, the proposed LHS
E-STaR of the North (LEaRN) Research Data Analysis Core (RDAC) is designed serve as a bridge and as a
nexus to coordinate and facilitate the dissemination, implementation, and extension or use of outputs—in
research and in practice—from LEaRN projects and other patient-centered outcomes and comparative
effectiveness research (PCOR/CER) initiatives. Community- and Patient-Engaged Research (CPEnR) will be
core to all RDAC activities—patients and communities will be engaged in LEaRN projects from research
inception through dissemination to help ensure that healthcare innovations are responsive to the voices and
needs of communities and patients. The RDAC will enhance the rigor and impact of LEaRN projects by
providing rigorous, cutting edge evaluation methods (e.g., evidence mobilization, pragmatic trial design,
informatics methods) and ensuring that projects are effectively disseminated. LEaRN’s Hub partner sites—M
Health Fairview, Minneapolis VA Health Care System, Essentia Health, HealthPartners, and Hennepin
Healthcare—bring diverse practice settings and patient populations, as well as research that closely aligns with
several AHRQ/PCORI priority areas: 1) transplantation and renal disease; 2) aging and dementia; 3) maternal
health and maternal morbidity and mortality; 4) primary care; 5) mental health and addiction; 6) surgery,
trauma, and critical care; and 7) social determinants of health and equity. The goals of the LEaRN RDAC will
be achieved through the following three aims: Co-create and execute PCOR and CER projects while
strengthening LEaRN partnerships and processes (Aim 1); Optimize Hub site, the Center for Learning Health
System Sciences (CLHSS), and joint research capabilities to address barriers to PCOR/CER research
processes including capabilities of distinction (Aim 2); and Disseminate LEaRN scientific outputs for both
internal and broader patient, community, practice, and academic benefit (Aim 3). The LEaRN RDAC will
address current gaps in effectively connecting LHS scientists with clinical practice sites, projects, research
capabilities and mentors and vice versa, overall resulting in high-quality PCOR/CER projects, LHS science
advancement, and optimized dissemination of scientific outputs for maximal impact."
10814343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the most common cardiovascular condition in preterm infants, is associated with
mortality and harmful longer-term outcomes including chronic lung disease (CLD) and brain injury. Although
treatment does not benefit all infants with PDA, likely due to spontaneous closure, treatment of some infants with
symptomatic PDA is necessary. Medications are often used to close persistent preterm PDA in the initial four
weeks postnatal, but fail to close the PDA in 1/3 of infants, in whom an intervention is the only remaining definitive
closure option (failed pharmacological management). A treatment dilemma exists in the first postnatal month for
the subset of infants with persistent, hemodynamically significant, and clinically symptomatic PDA (HSPDA) after
postnatal week one following failed pharmacological management. Invasive, intrathoracic PDA surgery was tra-
ditionally employed for infants with HSPDA, but associations between surgery and adverse neurodevelopment
prompted widespread adoption of non-interventional, supportive treatment. This watchful-waiting approach
avoids or delays procedure-related complications, but prolongs developing brain and lung exposure to PDA-
related hemodynamics. Evidence is emerging that duration of HSPDA exposure is an important predictor of CLD
and/or death. Percutaneous catheter-based closure (PPC) is a novel, minimally-invasive means of closing a
HSPDA. A duct occluder (ADO-II AS) was recently approved (1/2019) by the US FDA for preterm infants weigh-
ing ≥700 grams. However, the effectiveness of PPC in improving important neonatal outcomes relative to sup-
portive (non-intervention) HSPDA management has never been evaluated via a randomized trial (RCT). The
uncertainty is whether PPC should be performed early (days 7-30 postnatal) for all infants with HSDPA to prevent
PDA-related complications or only rarely as a last resort following a prolonged trial of supportive management.
The objective in this application is to determine if PPC improves cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental out-
comes via a multicenter RCT comparing the two strategies. Aim 1 will determine the effect of PPC versus sup-
portive treatment on ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 30 days post-randomization (non-survivors will be scored as
having zero VFDs). Aim 2 will determine the effect of PPC versus supportive treatment on secondary cardiopul-
monary, safety and neurodevelopmental outcomes. Aim 3 will evaluate whether neurodevelopment at 3-4
months corrected age is mediated by improved neurodevelopmental profiles at 34-36 weeks postmenstrual age.
Aim 4 will evaluate potential effect modifiers of HDPSA (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity, gestational age, age at ran-
domization) on VFDs and secondary outcomes. This trial will immediately advance the care of extremely preterm
infants with HSPDA following failed medical management by identifying whether PPC or supportive treatment
better improves cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes."
10814980,"HERCULES: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE – SUMMARY 
The Administrative Core (Admin Core) functions to support and develop critical leadership, organizational, and

of interest (Aim 4). Drawing on the strong foundation developed during the first two rounds of Center funding,
the IHSFC will expand in several key areas: 1) with the very successful programs in targeted and untargeted
analytical support, we will focus in Aims 1 and 2 on new innovations within our laboratory and analytical
methods; 2) with research support structure that bridges clinical and population-based research in Aim 3, we
will emphasize outreach and broad utilization of the IHSFC; and 3) building on tested exposomics tools and
technology, we will emphasize and prioritize a broader vision of translational research on the exposome in Aim
4. In doing so, the IHSFC will promote discovery in established and emerging environmental health concerns
and will foster development, implementation, and assessment of interventions to address these concerns.
IHSFC activities will be driven by the HERCULES exposome and translational research frameworks that
incorporate community knowledge and concerns. The IHSFC team has established national and international
research leadership in exposure science, chemistry, quantitative biology, metabolomics, and clinical and
population studies in broad environmental health areas. Within the Center, the IHFSC will work closely with the
CEC to enhance bidirectional understanding of exposome-related concepts, research, and their importance in
human health among HERCULES Member and community partners. The IHSFC will continue its key role as a
driver of the EHDSC, specifically to deliver data, enhance EHDSC utilization, and facilitate development of
exposome-related tools. The IHSFC will support investigators seeking to submit proposals to the PPP and will
support PPP-funded novel research projects that facilitate translation and integration of exposome-related

10814986,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Zebrafish Biomedical Research (ZBR) Facility
Core
The OSU Environmental Health Sciences Core Center (EHS CC), has developed a new, integrated approach to
address major elements of the NIEHS strategic plan. The environmental health sciences community is
becoming increasingly aware of the value that aquatic models can provide to identify chemical hazards and to
dissect the molecular pathways that influence disease. Over the last 10 years, with substantial EHS CC, NIEHS,
and Institutional investments, the Zebrafish Biomedical Research (ZBR) Facility Core has pioneered the
zebrafish model as an ideal vertebrate platform for discovery and translational research. The ZBR has created
one of the world's largest zebrafish toxicity facilities. We can assess responses to chemicals, nanoparticles, and
mixtures in over 3,000,000 animals annually. We operate the world's only certified specific pathogen-free
facility. We have developed innovative software and instrumentation that enable us to identify bioactive
compounds and to identify adverse outcome pathways. Our studies enable investigators to prioritize chemicals
for mammalian and epidemiological studies, and they provide a path toward biomarker and therapeutic
discovery. We operate the ZBR as a full-service facility for a dynamic cadre of EHS CC investigators and
stakeholders. Our central goal is to remove the technical and knowledge barriers so they can advance their
research programs by exploiting the unique advantages of zebrafish. The ZBR interfaces seamlessly with the
Chemical Exposure Core (CXC) and the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) and the Community
Engagement Core (CEC) to advance EHS research. The ZBR will specifically 1) help EHS CC investigators
understand the advantages and limitations of conducting environmental health sciences research with non-

studies; 3) provide unprecedented high-throughput research platforms to evaluate toxicity and to determine
toxicity mechanisms."

The HERCULES Community Engagement Core (CEC) plays a critical role in the Center mission of learning
how the exposome affects health and community well-being and using that knowledge to improve human

exposome concept to address community concerns. The CEC works with communities in the Atlanta metro
area, a diverse region facing myriad environmental injustices. Due to this complex regional exposome,
Atlanta’s environmental health (EH) community has coalesced around HERCULES and the exposome theme,
forming an active and engaged Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) representing both those who are impacted
and those who provide resources and oversight, including neighborhoods, non-profits, universities, and
government agencies. Our SAB oversees, guides, and develops CEC activities and budgets. Together, we
have had great success in achieving our previous goals of disseminating research findings, developing models
of engagement that enhance community capacity to address local EH concerns, and strengthening capacity for
community-engaged research among both community partners and EH scientists, leading to real impact,
including a Superfund Remediation and changes to a city’s zoning ordinances. Building on those
achievements, we used an iterative process of engaging, building trust with, and learning from our SAB,
community, and Center members, to develop our current Aims and activities. The CEC will facilitate multi-
directional dialogue and collaboration around EH and justice issues within the Atlanta community (Aim 1),
guide and support HERCULES members and students in community engagement and collaborative efforts that
are mutually beneficial, culturally responsible, & share power (Aim 2), and enhance community capacity to
address local EH concerns and partner in collaborative shared-power efforts (Aim 3). We will continue to
achieve multi-directional dialogue and collaboration by engaging our SAB to guide and inform our activities,
which include a partnership with the HERCULES Pilot Project Program to guide and support Center members
and students in community-engaged pilot projects as well as proposing CEC-led Translational Pilot
Projects that further advance HERCULES research across the Translational Research Framework. We will
offer two model community engagement programs that establish multi-directional dialogue, facilitate
engagement and collaboration, and enhance community capacity: 1) the four-phase Exposome Roadshow and
Community Grant Program supports a community to organize, plan, take, and sustain action around a priority
EH issue, and 2) our Data Science Workshops, a partnership with Emory’s Environmental Law Clinic and the
Environmental Health Data Sciences Core and Integrated Health Science Facility Core, addresses
community data needs, training residents to identify, collect, and use data to address local EH concerns."
10814989,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Chemical Exposure Facility Core (CXC)
The Chemical Exposure Facility Core (CXC), directed by Kim Anderson, supply passive sampling devices
(PSDs) and analytical services to advance environmental health science. Members of the EHS CC will apply
PSDs and our analytical methods to provide decision support for stakeholders such as community
organizations, manufacturers, regulators, legislators, NGOs, health care providers, and pharmaceutical firms.
Accurately assessing the breadth of a person's exposures to environmental toxicants is central to the challenge
of studying environmental health effects. The CXC offers directly analytical methods for over 1,500 organic
chemicals and facilitates additional chemical analyses through our additional campus resources. The lack of
low cost, easy-to-use personal sampling technology hinders epidemiological studies, especially in
disadvantaged populations. Over the last several years with OSU and EHS Core Center investments have built
personal sampling wristband technology with unique analytical methods. We made these investments,
specifically because Public Health faculty and Community partners were enthusiastic about its broad potential
to fill a key gap in Public Health. Our passive wristband sampler was developed to provide a relevant,
quantifiable assessment of chemical bioavailable exposure. The passive sampling platform including
wristbands will form the foundation for providing new and critical resources for Center researchers to measure
organic chemicals that are a crucial component of the chemical exposures. Over 1,500 volatile and semi-volatile
organic chemicals can be quantified. Through our core, in partnership with the Integrated Health Sciences
Facility Core and Community Engagement Cores, we enhance and stimulate many partnerships and
collaborative efforts using the analytical methods and passives sampling/wristband platform as the
gravitational force that bring researchers, public health experts, community organizations and citizens
together. Passive samplers naturally stimulate collaborative research relationships and interdisciplinary teams.
The Core will provide center investigator and study participants and their communities, novel and appropriate
data visualization of our wristband data. The CXC will extract and analyze chemical mixtures, thereby enabling
EHS CC members to measure concentrations of environmental toxicants."
10814990,"HERCULES: PILOT PROJECT PROGRAM – ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The HERCULES Pilot Project Program will build on our experience and success to support and expand
innovative exposome research at Emory University and Georgia Tech, in order to broaden the impact and
influence of the Center on the respective institutions and to continue to grow capacity of the Center in its
leadership in translational exposomic and environmental health-related research and technologies.
HERCULES Pilot Awards from the current cycle resulted in over 17 publications and received $9.5 million in
external funding for the research developed by their Projects. Community-engaged pilots were funded each
year and led to impacts on their community partners ranging from federal remediation efforts to local policy
change. The Pilot Project Program will fund six full, year-long, pilot projects per year as well as up to four
smaller ENHANCE grants that will provide HERCULES members with short-duration, limited funds on a time-
sensitive basis, to expedite new environmental health-focused NIH R- or P-level grants and/or gather data
needed for revision of a reviewed NIH application. The mechanism for review of the full applications is
augmented by a new collaboration with the NIEHS Environmental Health Core Center at North Carolina State
University. While the primary criterion for funding will be the perceived likelihood of the project to seed a
successful R-level NIEHS grant application, additional criteria are alignment with the NIEHS Strategic Plan,
cross-departmental (school or institutional) collaborations, investigators entering the field of environmental
health or exposome research, use of HERCULES Cores, and support for early career investigators, to whom
we will continue our commitment to their development with a target of at least two awards per year. The Pilot
Project Program will synergize with and enhance the activities of the Community Engagement Core by
earmarking at least one award per year for a community-engaged research project. We will also work with the
Career Development component of the Administrative Core to identify and provide guidance to those who
might benefit from pilot support. Pilot Program announcements and scientific review will also emphasize use
of the Integrated Health Sciences Facilities Core, and the Environmental Health Data Sciences Core.
Awardees will receive free or subsidized use of Core services during their Award. Through its function of
innovating exposome research, the Pilot Project Program is central to attaining our vision of serving as an
intellectual hub in the advancement and translation of exposome research to improve public health."
10820467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The gut microbiome aids in the digestion of complex polysaccharides, the absorption of vitamins, and the
conversion of primary bile acids, drugs, and other bioactive compounds into metabolites that can be absorbed
by the host. Thus, the metabolic activity of commensal microbes is closely intertwined with human physiology
and the nutritional impact of our diet. However, there is limited understanding of how variation in the ecology of
our intestinal flora modulates the biological impact of diet on human health and nutrition. Recent work has shown
that differences in the composition of the gut microbiome can help explain person-to-person heterogeneity in
glycemic responses, blood lipid profiles, and weight loss. In this proposal, we present an innovative platform for
personalized metabolic modeling of the gut microbiome using metagenomic and dietary data as constraints. We
propose the integration of tissue-resolved metabolic models of relevant host tissues, including a cell-type-specific
metabolic reconstruction of the gut epithelium, into our existing microbial community model to improve estimates
of metabolic fluxes between the gut microbiota, the diet, and the host. We will call this host-diet-microbiome
metabolic model ‘CyberGut.’ Using existing multi-omic data from a cohort of >3,000 adults, we will constrain and
validate CyberGut with paired measurements of diet, host blood metabolomes, and gut microbiomes. In addition,
we will generate cross-sectional training and validation data consisting of paired blood and fecal metabolomes,
fecal microbiomes, and detailed 3-day dietary recall data from a new cohort of 100 healthy participants. Using
these data, we will refine and test two novel and independent diet-inference algorithms, which leverage stool
metagenomes and stool untargeted metabolomes, respectively. Furthermore, using samples taken from a subset
of this new cohort (N=40), we will perform ex vivo stool culturing experiments, designed to directly quantify
metabolic fluxes and bacterial growth rates in vitro. These fluxomic data will be used to directly test in silico
CyberGut flux predictions in response to a diverse panel of dietary and host metabolite interventions. In addition
to contributing to the refinement and testing of our CyberGut model, the paired diet, microbiome, and
metabolomic data, including replicate fluxomic assays, generated in this proposal will be an invaluable resource
to the precision nutrition and human microbiome research community. In summary, we will build, refine, and test
a novel platform for tracking dietary intake and predicting personalized nutritional responses to diet, which has
the potential to fundamentally alter how we design and test dietary interventions."
10817923,"Cancers have different nutritional requirements from their healthy counterparts. Herein,
targeting the enzymes and thus the metabolic networks that constitute these different metabolic
requirements is attracting numerous drug development efforts. While targeting enzymes in
cancer-specific metabolic pathways has been successful, whether metabolism can be affected
to similar extents by nutritional manipulation in specific and controlled manners is largely
unknown. Methionine availability affects one-carbon cycle flux, DNA and histone methylation
and thus epigenetic programming. Dietary methionine restriction (MR) also promotes metabolic
health and extends insect and mammalian lifespan, two anti-cancer features. Thus, we
hypothesize that dietary MR could inhibit tumor growth and enhance anti-cancer therapy. Our
preliminary data show that dietary MR, a cost-effective approach, alters plasma methionine
effectively in both healthy mice and humans. MR mediates promising tumor outcomes: in two
RAS-driven colorectal cancer (CRC) patient-derived xenografts (PDX) models, it delays tumor
growth and sensitizes tumor to 5-Fluorouracil, a frontline chemotherapy for CRC; and in an
autochthonous KRASG12D+/-;TP53-/- soft tissue sarcoma model, it reaches a striking
synergistic effect with radiation. In these models, cysteine and methionine metabolism is the
most impacted metabolic pathway in the tumor and the plasma. However, the molecular
mechanisms by which dietary MR interacts with metabolism and eventually mediates tumor
outcome are unknown. To explore the mechanisms, I propose to focus on CRC PDX models
through the following two aims. In Aim 1, I will first employ a state of the art metabolomics
approach established in our laboratory to evaluate the metabolic alterations in tumor and non-
tumor tissues by dietary MR or a combination of MR and 5-FU. Upon consolidation of the
findings in vitro, I will conduct dietary interventions by supplementing cysteine or betaine to
determine the contribution of methionine as a sulfur donor and a one-carbon donor to tumor
growth in CRC PDX models, respectively. In Aim 2, I will first characterize the epigenetic and
genetic adaptions to dietary MR in tumor and CRC cell linesusing bisulfite sequencing, ATAC-
seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq. With these data, I will construct a metabolic network and perform
a functional screen of metabolic pathway genes using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The outcome
will reveal the metabolic, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms underlying dietary MR-mediated
tumor inhibition alone and in adjuvant with 5-FU in CRC. It is also anticipated to provide target
metabolite and genes for future hypothesis generation and novel therapy targeting cancer
metabolism."
10819826,"We aim to understand the biophysical mechanisms that enable the distinct intrinsic dynamics of projection-
defined dopamine (DA) neuron subpopulations by a combination of modeling and in vivo/in vitro experimental
strategies. We focus on how intrinsic dynamics differ between defined DA subpopulations, and how those
differences shape the integration of synaptic input within the circuit, including newly identified modes of burst
generation in DA neurons in vivo: plateau bursting and rebound bursting. We contrast a compressed dynamic
firing range DA population (DACR) with an extended dynamic range (DAER) based upon the maximum
frequency exhibited in response to depolarization, thereby probing differences in suprathreshold dynamics. We
also contrast ramp rebound (DAramp) and burst rebound (DAburst) populations based on the qualitative differ-
ences in post- hyperpolarization responses, which probe subthreshold dynamics. These categories are asso-
ciated with distinct axonal projection targets, implying participation in different circuits. One focus is on the
contributions of NaV channel gating and KV7 channel function to the extended versus compressed dynamic
range phenotype. The other focus is on the contribution of CaV3, KV4 and HCN channels to the rebound
ramp versus rebound burst phenotype. In each case, we apply projection-specific molecular interventions and
record extracellularly from freely moving mice to probe the causal role of altered intrinsic dynamic signatures
for motivated behavior. Computational modeling of distinct subpopulations (Canavier lab) guides experiments
based on mathematical insights on how the dynamics of bursting and pacemaking emerge from the ensemble
of ion channels. Patch-clamping in vivo DA mouse neurons with defined projection targets and selective
genetic manipulation of subpopulations (Roeper lab) provides critical insights into how the activity of distinct
subpopulations relates to behavior. We will generate predictions with computational models of DA
neuronal subtypes and test via in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological experiments in a synergistic
loop to define the causal contributions of identified biophysical mechanisms to relevant firing patterns. In Aim
1, we test the hypothesis that lower availability of auxiliary NaV subunit FGF13 in DAER allows higher maximal
rates in vitro than in DACR, that DAER firing range is further extended by plateau bursts, and that high
frequency bursts increase motivation or learning rate in a DA subpopulation specific manner. In Aim 2, we test
the hypothesis that the interplay between CaV3 (but not HCN) and KV4 in the dendrites determines whether the
DAramp or DAburst phenotype is expressed, and that the homogeneous responses of the DACRburst in the dorso-
lateral striatum (DLS) facilitate synchronized rebound bursting responses to disinhibition that facilitate move-
ment initiation. A better understanding of the intrinsic properties of distinct subpopulations of dopamine neurons
will be invaluable in targeting therapies for disorders with abnormal dopamine signaling, such as substance
abuse disorders, Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects >300 million people worldwide. It is a leading contributor to disability
and suicide, and thus a cross-cutting risk factor for many adverse life and health outcomes. It is heritable, and
genome-wide association recently been informative. However, nearly all current MDD samples are not enriched
in individuals with the highest clinical severity (i.e., the extreme tail of the phenotype distribution), a critical
weakness for clinical prediction. We propose to focus on “phenotype extreme MDD”. We will define these
individuals empirically on a population scale over years of follow-up in order to capture individuals with markedly
worse MDD clinical features (e.g., treatment-resistance, dense patterns of treatment, psychosis) and poor
outcomes (e.g., poor social function, disability, suicide). Cases with phenotype extreme MDD disproportionally
contribute to the global burden of MDD. We show that we can identify these individuals and preliminary data
suggest these individuals have a greater inherited burden of MDD risk alleles. We will address an additional
weakness in the field via multiple, highly powered layers of replication in independent cohorts. We need to know
quickly whether a promising model can replicate and generalize, and we have built the infrastructure for this.
In Aim 1, we will empirically identify “phenotype extreme MDD” in a training set of ⅓ of the Swedish population
with replication in independent samples (the other ⅔ from Sweden and harmonized datasets from Denmark and
Norway) and then generalization to independent samples from the UK (Generation Scotland, UK Biobank), and
the US (PsycheMERGE). In Aim 2, we will validate the empirical phenotype extreme MDD definition using
genomic data in the Aim 1 populations (i.e., pedigree- and SNP-heritability, contrast with other MDD definitions,
evaluate whether individuals with phenotype extreme MDD carry higher genetic risk scores for MDD). In Aim 3,
we will develop clinically useful prediction algorithms for extreme MDD: can we predict at first presentation who
will subsequently develop phenotype extreme MDD? We will have exceptional statistical power for all Aims.
Successful completion of these aims will enable our transformative, tertiary-preventive intention of valid and
clinically useful prediction of the subsequent development of phenotype extreme MDD early in a person’s
treatment history. This is foundational to achieve the overarching translational goal of deploying these models
on national scales in order to improve the health of MDD patients who are most severely ill."
10823227,"Project Summary & Abstract
Pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV (WLWH) and latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) are at
high risk of progressing to active TB. Safe and effective treatment during the latent phase is critical to
preventing active TB, in addition to reducing TB-related maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. Isoniazid
(INH) has been used for decades to treat active and latent TB infection, and there are several international
efforts to expand the use of INH preventive therapy (IPT) to address global TB burden. A recent large-scale
clinical trial in pregnant and postpartum WLWH revealed high rates of severe hepatotoxicity with IPT (~6-7%
vs. <1% based on historical data in non-pregnant adults) during the postpartum period (IMPAACT P1078).
Available evidence suggests reactive INH metabolites are involved in the development of hepatotoxicity with
INH. However, there are currently no data on the pharmacokinetics of INH metabolites in pregnant or
postpartum women. Additionally, there are immunologic and metabolic changes that occur during and after
pregnancy, which may further predispose this population to a higher risk of developing hepatotoxicity during
the postpartum period. Mechanistic insights are needed to inform the safe use of IPT in this population.
This proposal will leverage existing samples collected under the P1078 study to comprehensively examine PK,
immunologic, and metabolic changes in pregnant and postpartum WLWH on IPT using a case-control design.
The following aims are proposed: (1) to quantify INH metabolite PK in pregnant and postpartum WLWH
receiving IPT, (2) to identify biomarkers of hepatotoxicity in pregnant and postpartum WLWH receiving IPT,
and (3) to model relationships between INH metabolite exposures, toxicity biomarkers, and the development of
hepatotoxicity. In Aim 1, INH metabolites will be measured from intensive and sparse PK samples to quantify
INH metabolite PK in pregnant and postpartum women. In Aim 2, an enriched case-control design will be
applied to evaluate baseline and on-treatment biomarkers of hepatotoxicity using metabolomics and cytokine
arrays. Aim 3 will integrate data generated from Aims 1 and 2 to examine relationships between INH
metabolite exposures, metabolic and immunology biomarkers, and the development of hepatotoxicity. This
work will be complemented by a mentoring team comprised of experts in pharmacology, metabolomics,
immunology, and statistics, in addition to collaborators from the P1078 study. Dr. Brooks will also pursue
focused training and coursework in biostatistics, PK modeling, metabolomics, and hands-on experience in the
laboratory setting.
Dr. Brooks's career goal is to become an expert in the clinical pharmacology of TB medications and
mechanisms of immune-mediated adverse drug reactions. The proposed work in Dr. Brooks's K08 application
will provide her with a strong foundation to develop into an independent investigator in this field. Furthermore,
this work will address critical knowledge gaps in a vulnerable population to help support the safe uptake and
expansion of TB preventive therapies on a global scale."
10823228,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most prevalent pediatric chronic illnesses and requires a complex
treatment regimen. Youth with T1D, particularly those from ethnic minority and lower income backgrounds,
struggle to adhere to treatment demands; fewer than 30% achieve recommended levels of glycemic control.
Youth with poorly controlled T1D are at risk for health complications. Behavioral Family Systems Therapy for
Diabetes (BFST-D), a family-based behavioral intervention, is efficacious in improving health outcomes for
youth with T1D and initial effectiveness data suggest a brief version of BFST-D (bBFST-D) is associated with
improved glycemic control when delivered as part of standard care. However, few receive these services,
particularly those most at-risk, which complicates further evaluation of bBFST-D effectiveness when delivered
as part of standard care. Increasing the uptake of bBFST-D may lead to improved overall health of this
population. Implementation strategies are methods for integrating evidence-based practices into standard care.
The proposed K23 career development award aims to address these gaps in research and provides the means
by which Dr. Julia Price will complete scholarly training and practical experience to become an independent
investigator in pediatric T1D. The proposed study will develop a toolkit of implementation strategies to increase
the reach of bBFST-D by first conducting qualitative interviews with stakeholder groups to identify barriers and
facilitators of this care (Aim 1). The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) will guide
these interviews. Second, using results from Aim 1 and drawing from literature identifying conceptually unique
implementation strategies, a toolkit of implementation strategies will be developed (Aim 2). Iterative feedback
from a Diabetes Advisory Board comprised of stakeholders will facilitate this development process and support
identification of three implementation strategies to pilot. Third, the feasibility and acceptability of the selected
strategies will be evaluated through a single-case experiment at the PIs institution, and exploratory outcomes
(effectiveness of these strategies, change in patient health outcomes among those attending bBFST-D as part
of standard care) will also be examined (Aim 3). To explore potential healthcare disparities, provider referral
patterns across youth demographic variables will be examined. Through a combination of formal didactics and
direct mentored training experiences with her mentoring team (Drs. Kazak, Deatrick, Haire-Joshu, Bunnell,
Wysocki), Dr. Price will acquire skills and expertise in the following areas: 1) mixed methods research, 2)
implementation science, 3) optimizing electronic health record use for research and for implementing evidence-
based healthcare, and 4) designing and conducting clinical trials. Nemours, a national leader in pediatric T1D
behavioral research and health informatics, will provide Dr. Price with the ideal environment to successfully
complete the proposed project and achieve her goals of becoming an independent investigator and applying
for R01 funding to conduct a large multisite randomized hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial of bBFST-D."
10823337,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Migraine is a major pediatric health problem impacting 10-12% of youth. Poor sleep is a common comorbidity,
particularly insomnia symptoms, which are reported by 65-71% of adolescents with migraine. Insomnia
contributes to greater headache-related disability, more frequent headache, higher pain intensity, greater
anxiety and depressive symptoms, poorer quality of life, and increased health care use. History of childhood
migraine places youth at risk for a lifelong pattern of migraine and disability and high health care costs in
adulthood. Thus, finding effective methods that support youth in the self-management of migraine is a priority.
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for pain is an established treatment approach for youth with migraine;
however improvements in sleep are inconsistent. In fact, our preliminary data suggest that poor baseline sleep
is a risk factor for youth to achieve less improvement in pain outcomes with CBT for pain. Sleep and migraine
share a cyclical relationship, and data indicate that insomnia symptoms increase migraine severity in adults
and children. CBT for insomnia has demonstrated efficacy for improving insomnia symptoms in adults with
migraine and other pain conditions, however, effects on pain have been inconsistent. Post-hoc analyses
suggest that changes in pain may occur only after there are sustained improvements in sleep, but this has
never been empirically tested. In the proposed study, we will address these gaps in knowledge by using an
innovative 2-Phase trial design to: 1) test efficacy of CBT insomnia intervention for youth with migraine and
comorbid insomnia, and 2) investigate how changes in sleep may modify response to CBT pain intervention.
We will study a cohort of 180 youth, ages 11-17 years, with migraine (with or without aura, chronic migraine)
and comorbid insomnia. In Phase 1, youth will be randomly assigned to receive internet-delivered CBT
insomnia intervention or internet sleep education control over 4-weeks. In Phase 2, all youth will receive
internet-delivered CBT pain intervention over 8-weeks. Assessments will occur at baseline, immediately after
Phase 1 intervention, immediately after Phase 2 intervention, and repeated 6 months post-intervention. The
primary outcome for Phase 1 is insomnia symptoms. The primary outcome for Phase 2 is headache-related
disability. Secondary outcomes are sleep quality and sleep patterns, headache frequency and pain intensity,
anxiety and depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Sleep hygiene and pre-sleep arousal will be assessed as
potential mediators. We will use a comprehensive multidimensional assessment of sleep and headache
including self-report questionnaires, ambulatory actigraphy monitoring, and 14-day daily diaries. Given the high
prevalence of insomnia in adolescents with migraine, extension of CBT insomnia intervention to this population
will address an important gap in clinical practice and in conceptual understanding of the relationship between
sleep and migraine. By testing a separate CBT insomnia intervention, we will be able to apply this treatment in
the future to other pediatric populations (e.g., cancer, arthritis) who commonly experience comorbid insomnia."

Infectious diseases are a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality, accounting for 29% of worldwide
deaths. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a useful tool in pathogen detection, strain identification, and drug
susceptibility testing (among other applications). A primary issue for NGS for rapid pathogen genomic analysis
is that raw patient samples typically have a low bacterial load, requiring culturing that can take weeks to months
before a sufficient microbial load is generated. However, culturing is economically and logistically unsustainable
and presents with other biological issues that may confound results. Additionally, enrichment of the pathogen-
specific genes is highly dependent on sample extraction efficiency. Using nucleic acid testing (NAT) and NGS
methods, efficient DNA extraction is essential for the successful and accurate identification of microorganisms
or populations of microbes. Poor DNA extraction when analyzing clinical and environmental samples consisting
of resilient microbes leads to inconclusive or inaccurate diagnostic results. There is a need for high-efficiency
extraction of nucleic acids from hard-to-lyse microorganisms in direct patient samples to facilitate reliable clinical
diagnostic workflows. Triangle Biotechnology (Triangle Bio) is developing a novel and proprietary
technology for efficient, high-throughput, reproducible, and unbiased microbial lysis, based on a
cavitation-enhancing nanodroplet reagent for use with low-cost sonication devices. The proposed
nanodroplets preferentially target to microbes with resilient cell walls and deliver focused mechanical shear
forces. In Phase I, Triangle Bio demonstrated a 6-100x and 2-5x improvement in DNA extraction from
Mycobacterium smegmatis (a model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mtb]) and Enterococcus faecalis (a Gram-
positive bacteria), respectively, compared to commonly used commercial kits. In Phase II, the company will
establish a platform of nanodroplet formulations applicable to a wide range of infectious pathogens with
significant clinical impact. Triangle Bio will accomplish this research through the following three aims: 1) Identify
targeting ligand candidates compatible with 12 representative microbial species and three clinical sample
matrices (Y1), 2) Validate binding and cavitation performance of candidate formulations and optimize workflow
conditions for clinical sample matrices spiked with four target microbial species (Y2-Y3), and 3) Evaluate
workflows by demonstrating improved performance of targeted NGS for diagnosis of drug-resistant Mtb (Y3).
Successful implementation of this technology could have significant impacts on a wide range of applications
requiring reliable microbial lysis techniques, including but not limited to NGS for infectious disease detection and
diagnosis, NGS based food safety testing for infectious pathogens, and clinical and environmental microbiome
studies where resilient microbes can be underrepresented in metagenomic analysis."

We and others have demonstrated that antigens derived from infectious viral infections persist in the host for
extended periods of time, well beyond the time in which the infection is cleared from the host. Our lab has
specifically identified that antigens derived from both vaccination and viral infections persist or are archived by
the host lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC)s, identifying the source of archived antigens. We have published
that this archived antigen maintains a more effector like pool of antigen specific memory cells which enhances
the clearance of a secondary infectious challenge. Identification of key mechanisms involved in antigen
archiving during vaccination is critical for our understanding of enhanced protective immunity to vaccination.
While we have established many important criteria for antigen archiving and protective immunity, in this
renewal application we aim to dive deeper into the cell types involved and the processes required. We aim to
better appreciate how the expression of subset specific genes, now discovered in both lymphatic endothelial
cells and dendritic cells, may be required for antigen handling, the implications of which could affect antigen
archiving and protective immunity. We have established a novel methodology leveraging the 10x genomics
platform to identify DNA-antigen conjugates for the study of antigen dispersal over long periods of time. With
this methodology and technology in hand we now have the capability to accurately and faithfully measure cell
types that acquire antigens as well as the exact number of antigens within each cell over time. Using these
studies we have identified several novel findings based on antigen amount and transcriptional signature to lead
us to the hypothesis that specific LECs and DCs, based on their transcriptional program, contribute to the
acquisition, retention and exchange of antigens. Furthermore, this handling of antigens by LECs and DCs can
be manipulated by other inflammatory events that cause antigen release and presentation, and as a result,
improve immune responses to secondary and heterologous infections."

10823341,"Summary
It is well known that sleep loss is associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences, but to
date the impact of sex differences in response to sleep loss are poorly understood. We and others have shown
that women have greater neurobehavioral performance impairment than men when exposed to one night of
acute sleep loss. Furthermore, when this effect is examined separately by menstrual cycle phase, women in the
follicular phase exhibit greater impairment compared to both men and women during the luteal phase, suggesting
a possible endocrine mechanism. Indeed, we have shown that these differences in performance may be driven
by sex-steroid-mediated changes in core body temperature (CBT), specifically involving the ratio of progesterone
(P4) to estradiol (E2) between the follicular and luteal phases. These findings have important implications for
understanding the interactions of sleep loss and female sex hormones on neurobehavioral performance and
other health consequences. An important open question, however, is how these menstrual-phase-dependent
differences impact performance under more realistic patterns of chronic sleep loss. Millions of women routinely
obtain less than the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep per night during the week and attempt to catch up on sleep
on the weekend. In men, we have shown that any apparent improvement during such recovery sleep is transient,
and that subsequent sleep loss results in more accelerated deterioration in performance. It is unknown how this
variable pattern of chronic sleep loss and recovery sleep impacts performance in women during the follicular and
luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. The proposed work will fill this important gap in knowledge. In our proposed
11-day inpatient study, healthy premenopausal women will be randomized to either chronic variable sleep
deficiency (with a repeated pattern of two nights of 3 hours time-in-bed followed by one night of 10 hours time-
in-bed, equivalent to our prior study in mean) or a sleep satiation control (10 hours time-in-bed throughout) during
either the follicular or luteal phase of their menstrual cycle. This protocol will allow us to quantify both the impact
of chronic variable sleep deficiency on neurobehavioral performance in women and differences in the response
to chronic variable sleep loss across the menstrual cycle. We will also investigate the role of CBT, P4, and E2 in
mediating these responses. As an exploratory analysis, we will also evaluate the impact of chronic variable sleep
loss on E2 and P4 levels to investigate the effect of insufficient sleep on circulating levels of female sex hormones
across the menstrual cycle.

10898922,"Historically, preclinical research has focused disproportionately on males. This bias has limited the progress of science to advance national health and welfare. In 2016, to encourage inclusion of both males and females in research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) implemented a policy requiring the consideration of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in all funded studies. Although inclusion of females has improved, sex-based data are often not being analyzed using rigorous approaches. Our preliminary analysis of SABV-compliant studies showed that when authors report sex-specific effects, they tested statistically for such effects only 29% of the time. Instead, claims of sex-specific findings typically rest on assertion alone. Our past findings indicate clearly that the implementation of SABV by researchers has not been as rigorous as it could be and that the process of peer review of SABV-compliant research needs to improve. False claims of sex differences can lead to the wasting of resources on ‘differences’ that do not exist, and to inequities in access to effective treatments. Similarly, false claims of non-differences can lead to missed opportunities to provide effective health care for people of all sexes and genders. The intended goals of SABV, namely to enhance reproducibility and to facilitate sex-based precision medicine, are not being met. In this project we will determine the impact of inappropriate analytical approaches on the accurate reporting of sex-specific effects, identify factors that inform decisions about analytical approaches to sex-based data, and disseminate tools for designing and evaluating studies that consider SABV. We will use a mixed method approach that includes analyses of published journal articles, interviews with scientists, and outreach. In Aim 1, we will conduct a large-scale analysis of the biomedical literature to show how inappropriate statistical approaches to sex-based data are impacting the rigorous implementation of SABV. In Aim 2, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with authors of some of those publications to identify the factors that facilitate best practices. Together, the first two aims will inform the development of a workflow for appropriate analysis of sex-based data. In Aim 3, we will make our optimized workflow publicly available and disseminate it widely. A large part of this effort will involve journal editors and other likely reviewers to apply the tools directly in the context of publishing, thus increasing rigor in the reporting of sex differences and, in turn, the effectiveness of SABV policies."
10804773,"Project Summary: Amphetamines (AMPHs) are a class of psychostimulants that includes compounds
commonly used for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g. attention deficit disorders) as well as drugs
of abuse. The abuse liability of AMPHs stems from their capacity to elevate synaptic levels of dopamine (DA)
and activate natural reward pathways in the brain. AMPH does this, at least in part, via reversal of the dopamine
transporter (DAT), a membrane protein physiologically responsible for import of DA into presynaptic neurons.
Reversal of DAT leads to mobilization of cytoplasmic DA through non-vesicular DA release (DA efflux). The
psychomotor stimulant properties of AMPH, as well as induction of reward, are dependent upon this efflux. In
fact, inhibition of DA efflux reduces both the ability of AMPH to increase locomotion as well as AMPH preference.
 A growing amount of data shows reciprocal communication between the microbiome and the brain.
Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) is a member of the human microbiome that enhances behavioral
responses to AMPH by secreting butyrate, inhibiting histone deacetylase complex activity, and increasing
expression of the dopamine transporter. Interestingly, not only does F. nucleatum enhance host responses to
AMPH, AMPH increases abundance of F. nucleatum in both rodents, and humans, suggesting a feedforward
paradigm that reinforces both imbalances in the microbiome (dysbiosis) as well as amphetamine use disorders.
 How AMPH enhances the abundance of F. nucleatum is not known. F. nucleatum is a gram-negative
anaerobic rod that uses biofilm formation with aerobic or facultative partners to generate a protective barrier that
stabilizes F. nucleatum colonies in the host. Our data demonstrates that AMPH enhances biofilm formation
between F. nucleatum and the facultative bacteria Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). Of note, F. nucleatum
and S. mutans are both bacterial species that are highly associated with dental caries and gingivitis, periodontal
diseases commonly comorbid with AMPH use disorders. Interestingly, biofilm formation in S. mutans is
dependent upon glucosyl transferases (Gtfs), enzymes that aid in assembly and organization of the extracellular
matrix of biofilms, and AMPH enhances expression of these Gtfs.
 We hypothesize that Gtfs, expressed by S. mutans, are required for formation of F. nucleatum:S. mutans
mixed species biofilms, increases in abundance of F. nucleatum, and enhancement of host responses to AMPH.
We test this hypothesis in the following aims:
S.A. #1: Determine how Gtf activity regulates AMPH-enhanced biofilm formation, between F. nucleatum
and S. mutans, and host colonization.
S.A. #2: Define how Gtf activity alters AMPH-induced behavioral responses."

Microglia are immunocompetent cells that interact dynamically with multiple cell types to shape brain
development and maintain neural circuits. It has been hypothesized that dysfunction of microglia may
contribute to the development and clinical course of schizophrenia (SZ). However, recent evidence has shifted
our understanding from a model that involved neuroinflammatory microglial response. Instead, evidence
supports a SZ model whereby microglia show dysfunction that disrupts neuroplasticity, neurocircuit
development, and neurotransmission, ultimately altering glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling along
relevant frontostriatal circuits and onset of psychosis in late adolescence or adulthood. Molecular imaging
agents for clinical and translational study of microglia in the brains of diseased populations or model systems,
including SZ, are eagerly pursued. In this proposal we focus on the colony stimulating factor 1 receptor
(CSF1R), which is an imaging target expressed on the cell surface of microglia. CSF1R is an attractive imaging
target because it is chiefly expressed by microglia, and not other cell types in brain parenchyma. Toward
measuring CSF1R in vivo, we developed [11C]CPPC (CPPC), a PET radiotracer that has optimized properties
for neuroimaging. This project also builds on our previous studies of microglia in early stages of psychosis, and
recent published evidence supporting low CSF1R in brain tissue of patients with SZ. Based on published
evidence and preliminary data, we hypothesize lower CSF1R, consistent with downregulation of this microglial
marker, in the striatum and in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of individuals with recent onset of SZ
compared to healthy controls. Within SZ, we hypothesize that lower CSF1R in striatum will be associated with
amotivation. Lower CPPC binding in DLPFC will be associated with impaired cognitive control and lower
working memory performance. Study of the relationship between microglial marker signatures and clinical
sequelae in SZ in the intact human brain is ideal since these cells change their phenotype outside this natural
milieu. Our study may position CPPC PET as a promising tool for human and back-translational research
aimed at studying, monitoring, or reprogramming the microglial response in SZ or related animal models."
10929504,"Project Summary/Abstract
Implementing effective prehospital medical care could prevent over half of injury-related deaths. As a first step
toward development of prehospital care systems, several low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) in sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) have instituted lay first responder (LFR) programs training non-medical professionals
with high exposure to injury in first aid and safe transport of injured patients. Although promising, lack of
research infrastructure and medical records in SSA has limited prior evaluation of the feasibility and
effectiveness of LFR implementation in increasing quality prehospital care. Cameroon is disproportionately
affected by injury and lacks a prehospital care system, likely contributing to treatment delays and preventable
morbidity and mortality. Development of a lay first responder program could increase access to
prehospital care and facilitate timely treatment of injuries but only if it is feasible and effective for the
Cameroonian context. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce the burden associated with injury in
Cameroon. This study’s overall objective is to increase access to quality prehospital trauma care in Cameroon
by using an implementation science approach to develop and evaluate a data-driven LFR program in
Cameroon. The study hypothesis is that is implementation of a data-adapted lay first responder program is a
feasible and effective method of increasing access to prehospital care among injured Cameroonian patients.
To accomplish our objective, this study will pursue three specific aims: 1) Develop a Cameroon-adapted LFR
program using a two-stage, mixed-methods approach; 2) Evaluate feasibility of LFR program implementation in
the Cameroonian context; and 3) Evaluate effectiveness of LFR program implementation in the Cameroonian
context. Validating LFR as a feasible means to increase access to prehospital care will remove a major
roadblock in delivering timely trauma care and provide a critical target for reducing the detrimental impact of
injury on this population. Understanding associations between LFR implementation, physiologic parameters
and outcomes will allow data-informed, iterative improvement of LFR training. Development of a reproducible
method for context-adaptation of LFR could be rapidly scaled for wider implementation throughout Cameroon
and validated in other LMIC contexts and sectors."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the protein tyrosine phosphatase N2 (PTPN2) gene are
confirmed risk markers in both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), Crohn’s disease (CD) and
ulcerative colitis (UC). PTPN2 loss-of-function variants reduce PTPN2 activity and are associated with
more severe disease in IBD patients. While we and others have utilized PTPN2 knockdown and
knockout models to generate preliminary insights into the potential contributions of PTPN2 loss-of-
function in IBD development, there is very little information as to how PTPN2 clinical variants
compromise intestinal homeostasis. A major contributor to this knowledge gap lies in the lack of suitable
model systems to study PTPN2 variants in intestinal epithelial cells, the critical cell type that comprises
the gut barrier. To address this, we propose to utilize IBDGC resources to 1) identify gene clustering,
expression, and biological pathways altered in IBD patients carrying the PTPN2 rs1893217 loss-of-
function variant; 2) generate novel in vitro models that will allow us to mechanistically probe key targets,
perform challenge and rescue (using pharmacologic and genetic approaches) experiments; and 3)
generate novel gut-on-chip models to integrate these findings into a more physiologically relevant
experimental system.
Outcomes & Impact: This proposal will capitalize on our expertise in studying roles of PTPN2 in
multiple facets of IBD pathophysiology by utilizing the unique resources of IBDGC to develop cutting-
edge models for a greater translational understanding of how PTPN2 variants contribute to IBD. These
models will also represent a significant advance to the field for discovery biology and for future
‘personalized’ drug development studies."

 This proposal describes a five-year mentored research career development project focused on evaluating
gene editing delivered via extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a novel approach for contraception. Almost half of
United States pregnancies are unintended, and available contraceptives often have undesirable side effects and
are effective only when utilized properly. Therefore, new easy-to-use contraceptive products with less side
effects are required. A survey of postpartum women indicated about 50% prefer permanent sterilization
compared with other contraceptives. The only permanent contraceptive available is surgical sterilization; while
routinely performed, there are anesthetic risks, high surgical cost, and requires facilities and personnel that are
absent in most low income locations. Non-surgical options for permanent contraception are currently unavailable.
 By secreting proteins that allow sperm capacitation, fertilization, and early embryo development, the
oviduct (fallopian tube) is essential for fertility. Oviductal epithelial cell progesterone receptor (PGR) and oviduct
specific glycoprotein (OVGP1) gene knockouts in mice induce infertility and reduce litter sizes, respectively.
Gene editing using CRISPR-cas9 has recently gained popularity in a clinical trial for sickle cell anemia and has
been used to edit neoplastic genes resulting in tumor shrinkage in rodent models in vivo. However, tissue-specific
targeting of CRISPR-cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and in vivo transfection are challenging. EVs contain
proteins and nucleic acids within a lipid bilayer and are naturally secreted for intercellular communication.
Because EVs are produced in vivo for cell transport, they circumvent immune clearance, avoid hypersensitivity
reactions, and gain entry to cells that may not be accessible for foreign compounds alone. The overall goal of
this proposal is to evaluate the utility of EVs for targeting RNPs to oviductal cells. Specifically, we will evaluate
in vivo biodistribution of EVs deposited intrauterine in a mouse model to determine dissemination of EVs (Aim
1). Then, we will determine in vitro gene editing of EVs loaded with RNPs by designing guide RNAs to knock out
essential fertility genes (PGR, OVGP1) in oviductal organoids (Aim 2.1) prior to assessing in vivo gene editing
in a mouse model followed by a breeding trial to evaluate utility as a permanent contraceptive (Aim 2.2). In
addition to generating knowledge on mechanisms influencing oviductal function, this project will lead to
optimization of conditions for efficient delivery of CRISPR-cas9 RNPs to oviductal cells. Findings could lay the
foundation for development of a non-surgical, permanent contraception for women.
 The candidate is a postdoctoral fellow at Colorado State University and has assembled a diverse team
of experts to serve on her advisory committee. This proposal builds upon the candidate’s previous research
background and will augment her expertise in reproductive biology with specialized training in gene editing, EV
characterization and engineering, and mouse colony management. Furthermore, the training and development
plan is comprehensive and tailored to her needs, which will facilitate her transition to an independent researcher."

Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are common infections that represent a significant burden on healthcare
systems worldwide. In 2006 alone, UTIs were the source of 11 million physician visits and cost the
United States over $3.5 billion. A significant portion of these infections are Catheter-Associated UTIs
(CAUTIs), accounting for up to 40% of hospital acquired infections globally. A major cause of CAUTIs
is Proteus mirabilis, an understudied Gram-negative member of the Enterobacterales order. This
organism is most noted for its ability to swarm on agar and form urinary stones in infected patients.
Previous studies have used a mouse model of UTI to identify factors that contribute to fitness and
virulence in the urinary tract. While these datasets strongly implicate transcriptional regulators, there is
much to learn about transcriptional networks in this species. Toward this end, I have developed the
framework to employ Transcriptional Regulator Induced Phenotype (TRIP) screening to identify
specific regulators that contribute to uropathogenesis. TRIP leverages a library of strains containing
inducible expression constructs that each encode a single regulator. Pools of these strains will be
inoculated into the mouse model of UTI to assess comparative fitness. Sequencing and bioinformatic
analyses will be used to assess relative fitness of TRIP strains and identify strains with a competitive
edge in the bladder environment. After identifying these key regulators, I aim to define the downstream
regulatory networks using RNA-sequencing and employ genetic approaches, biochemical assays, and
the murine model of UTI to ascertain the molecular mechanisms behind the fitness advantage. Using
a systematic bioinformatics approach, I have identified 232 putative transcriptional regulators in the
HI4320 genome. Only 3 of these regulators have defined regulons published in the literature. Thus far,
35/232 (15%) of the constructs have been generated. During library construction, I have validated the
TRIP framework using a variety of techniques (growth curves, qRT-PCR, and plasmid maintenance
experiments). These studies indicate that stable expression of regulators is not broadly toxic, the
selected promoter is inducible, and the construct vectors are stable both in vitro and in vivo. This project
represents the first in vivo application of TRIP and will identify regulators and characterize key
regulatory networks that drive Proteus mirabilis uropathogenesis."

to science, education and mentoring, clinical practice, and professional leadership and service.
During his 30-year career of NIH-supported research, he has made seminal discoveries that
have advanced our understanding of the normal biology and regulatory processes governing
key lung cells, and the mechanisms by which these processes are dysregulated during
inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. His research program is predominantly focused on two
important cell types – alveolar macrophages (AMs) and lung fibroblasts (Fibs) – with qualifying
R01 awards currently funding studies of each. The current AM project builds upon our prior
report that AMs secrete suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) within extracellular vesicles
(EVs) that can be internalized by epithelial cells (ECs) to dampen pro-inflammatory JAK-STAT
signaling. Objectives during the award period are to characterize: a) mechanisms by which AM
packaging of SOCS3 within EVs can be modulated; b) the global proteome of AM-derived EVs;
c) effects of AM EVs (and artificial SOCS3-containing liposomes) on allergen-activated
inflammatory signaling in bronchial ECs; and d) effects of vesicular SOCS3 on malignant
transformation of ECs and tumorigenic properties of cancer cells. In a new direction, we will
elucidate the stimuli, signaling, transcriptional, and regulatory mechanisms governing self-
replication of AMs in comparison with other macrophage populations. The current Fib project
builds upon ongoing studies to understand signaling and transcriptional mechanisms involved in
pro-fibrotic properties of Fibs. Objectives during the award period are to characterize: a) the
actions and responsible mechanisms of forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) – a transcription factor best
known as a proto-oncogene but never previously studied in Fibs – in mediating Fib
differentiation to highly pathogenic myoFibs and their apoptosis resistance; b) the interplay of
FOXM1 with other transcription factors; and c) the mechanisms by which prostaglandin E2-cyclic
AMP signaling inhibits FOXM1 and Fib activation, and the role of induction of several molecular
brakes in such inhibition. New directions include characterizing mechanisms by which the drug
bortezomib inhibits Fib activation independent of proteasomal inhibition and elucidating
mechanisms to explain opposing actions of cyclic AMP on proliferation of Fibs vs. ECs. This
OIA will support the PI's program of innovative and translationally relevant research in lung cell
and molecular biology while allowing him to increase his commitment to mentoring and
educational and professional service."
10795965,"Synaptic communication in the nervous system is accomplished by two major classes of synapses, chemical
and electrical, which operate in different ways. Electrical synapses are formed by gap junctions between neurons
and allow passage of electrical current directly between cells, providing fast and often bi-directional
communication. Cellular control of the magnitude of this communication refines local and long-range neural
network functions, and is an important component of network plasticity. Electrical synapse plasticity plays a
particularly important role in sensory adaptation in the vertebrate retina, where changes in coupling of some
networks exceed an order of magnitude.
 The long-term goals of this established research project are to elucidate the mechanisms that control
plasticity of electrical synapses. In recent work, we have discovered an intimate relationship between the actin
cytoskeleton and functional control of coupling in Connexin 36 (Cx36) gap junctions. This appears to integrate
the main components of excitatory and inhibitory signaling and switching between those modes. This project
will investigate those links, using a combination of cell culture and mouse retina model systems. We will test
three specific hypotheses about regulation of Cx36 functional coupling in the following ways: (1) Signaling protein
complexes that regulate Cx36 coupling are associated with the actin cytoskeleton. Using proximity labeling and
quantitative proteomic techniques, we will identify signaling components involved in the regulation of Cx36
coupling. We will further investigate the dynamic changes in proximity of these components to Cx36 during
regulatory signaling. (2) Phosphorylation of Cx36 alters its association with signaling components. We will
investigate how phosphorylation of certain residues of Cx36 regulates the association of some signaling
components. (3) RhoA and Cdc42 signaling pathways modulate functional plasticity. We will investigate how
pathways that control cytoskeletal remodeling influence coupling of Cx36.
 The proposed studies will elucidate mechanisms central to control of electrical synapse functional plasticity.
Knowledge of these mechanisms will provide a great deal of insight not only into the control of visual adaptation
processes in the retina, but also electrical synapse plasticity throughout the brain. This will allow the
development of targeted therapies for disorders in which gap junctions play a role."

For years, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) has provided key leadership within
the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). The leaders of this UG1 application and other faculty members
hold major NCTN roles, including chairing clinical trials and committees. From March 2014 through August
2017, UTSW enrolled 520 patients on adult NCTN trials across 13 disease categories. During that time, UTSW
faculty authored or co-authored 27 publications directly related to NCTN trials, and have chaired, co-chaired, or
served as cooperative group committee chairs on 13 cooperative group trials. Substantial recent growth
positions UTSW to expand accrual and scientific contributions. After receiving initial NCI designation in 2010,
the Harold C. Simmons Cancer Center received comprehensive designation in 2015. Since 2015, two new
hospitals affiliated with UTSW have been constructed. We have a vibrant drug discovery program; SPORE
grants in lung cancer and kidney cancer; an Advanced Imaging Research Center; and a Patient Centered
Outcomes Research (PCOR) Center. As the only academic medical center and medical school in the
Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) Metroplex (population 7.2 million) and the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer
Center in North Texas, UTSW reaches a large and diverse population that otherwise would not have access to
NCTN trials. In recent years, up to 29% of our patients enrolled on NCTN clinical studies were Hispanic, and
up to 21% were African American. The specific aims of the UTSW UG1 are the following: Aim 1. Contribute
to NCTN trial accrual. We will continue to enroll patients with diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds on
therapeutic and non-therapeutic trials. Aim 2. Contribute to NCTN scientific direction. We will bring UTSW
basic, translational, and imaging research into hypothesis-driven clinical trials. Aim 3. Provide NCTN
leadership. UTSW faculty will continue to chair and co-chair clinical trials and committees in the various
NCTN groups, and by participate in NCI activities and initiatives. Aim 4. Promote career development of
junior faculty and trainees. UTSW faculty will provide mentoring and guidance in the NCTN. Aim 5. Support
NCTN administrative efforts. UTSW faculty will continue to serve on NCTN and NCI regulatory and auditing
committees. At multiple steps, the design and conduct of cancer clinical research has become more
challenging. Financial pressures have limited the protected time of clinical investigators nationwide. Increasing
cost and complexity of clinical trials has prolonged activation timelines and restricted eligibility. UTSW is poised
to meet and overcome these challenges. With designated funding and mentoring programs, we continue to
develop clinical investigators and disease experts. We have capitalized on a large and diverse patient base, as
well as growing bioinformatics capabilities, to optimize the identification, screening, and enrollment of clinical
trial subjects. Together, these approaches position UTSW to continue to help lead and expand NCTN efforts."

 Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly in developed
nations, representing a significant socioeconomic burden. Even though its multifactorial nature is well
recognized, the pathogenesis of AMD is not fully understood. This has led to the current absence of treatments
for dry AMD and lack of reliable ways to determine risk prediction for progression. Thus, there is great need for
better understanding of AMD pathobiology and identification of biomarkers.
 Our group has reported (PMID 28542375, 28916333 and 30672297) and there is new data showing
that metabolomics—the qualitative and quantitative analysis of metabolites (molecules <1 kDa)—is an
appropriate approach to address these needs. While the metabolome is downstream of the genome,
transcriptome, and proteome, it is simultaneously impacted by a wide range of environmental exposures.
Therefore, the metabolome closely represents phenotype, as demonstrated in complex conditions, such as
cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. To evaluate the role of metabolomics in AMD, we initiated a cross sectional
study in which we prospectively recruited 491 patients, obtained an ophthalmological exam and collected
fasting blood and urine samples. Analysis of the blood samples identified changes in the metabolomics profile
of patients with AMD compared to controls, with differences across AMD severity stages. These differences
were mostly found in the lipid pathways, in particular glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids, and purines.
 In this application, our goal is to provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of AMD, and to identify
metabolomic signals that can lead to future biomarkers of this disease and its progression. To do so, we will
further characterize the metabolome of AMD. This will be achieved by: 1) performing tissue metabolomics in
donor eyes with AMD and control eyes using mass spectrometry (Aim 1A), and assessing correlations
between the metabolomic profiles of AMD in tissue and biofluids (i.e. plasma and urine) (Aim 1B); 2) re-
assessing our study cohort with early and intermediate AMD, five years after the initial enrolment, with the
same protocols, to compare the metabolome of AMD-progressors versus non progressors (Aim 2); and 3)
studying the associations between genes linked with AMD risk and metabolomics profiles (Aim 3A), and
identifying new metabolite-AMD associations (Aim 3B).
 This project will provide a unique strategy to increase the current understanding of AMD pathogenesis.
By performing tissue metabolomics and studying metabolomics-gene interactions, this proposal will help in
identifying new targets for prevention and earlier intervention, thus reducing the burden of AMD. Additionally,
this work has the potential to identify biological biomarkers of AMD and disease progression at five years in
accessible biofluids, which may contribute to improved screening and risk assessment of AMD and usher in an
era of precision medicine for this blinding condition."

 The stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome (SCLL) is unique in that it is the only cancer syndrome
that results consistently from the ligand independent activation of FGFR1 tyrosine kinase. Presenting as a
myeloproliferative disorder it rapidly progresses to AML and in many cases patients develop biphenotypic T-
cell or B-cell lymphomas. The consensus thinking is that FGFR1 promotes a stem cell expansion which can
progress and develop depending on the subsequent acquisition of oncogenic events. This disease provides a
unique opportunity to investigate basic genetic events associated with maintenance of a stem cell phenotype
as well as the events that allow progression to AML. We have developed mouse models for SCLL using
retroviral transduction and transplantation of human and mouse stem cells which recapitulate the primary
human disease. These models have facilitated a detailed analysis of the genetic events that accompany
progression of SCLL allowing development of strategies to treat this disease. We recently identified a series of
unexpected and unique insights into the development of the disease which are paradigm shifting. While the
consensus understanding has been that the phosphoactivated kinase leads to disease development as a result
of direct activation of target proteins, we have demonstrated recently that the chimeric kinases can be
enzymatically cleaved to a truncated form (nFGFR1) that carries only the kinase domain and that this is
located exclusively in the nucleus and is not phosphorylated. Transduction experiments show that the nFGFR1
is capable of transforming hematopoietic stem cells on its own which maintain a stem cell phenotype. These
observations suggest that transformation is due to a transcription factor role of nFGFR1 leading to activation of
specific genes and further, that drugs currently designed to target the phosphorylated parental kinase will not
cure the disease. The systems we have developed will allow identification of the nFGFR1 targets and allow
rational design of synthetic lethal approaches to eliminate the stem cells and mature leukemic cells. Our
genomic study of SCLL has demonstrated a role for specific microRNAs in disease development. During this
process we demonstrated that SCLL cells are immunogenic and that miR339 facilitates escape from immune
tolerance and promotes escape from the immune suppression of the microenvironment. The cell systems we
have developed allow mechanistic studies of the underlying causes. This study is particularly timely, since one
key open question in the field is the molecular mechanisms behind how tumor cells manipulate their
microenvironment so as to actively create immmuno-suppression and tolerance, and thus evade the immune
system. These tumor-intrinsic pathways are still largely unknown. The miR339 system provides a striking
“on/off” system of inducible immunosuppression, that instantly converts tumor cells from immunogenic and
non-lethal to immunosuppressive and lethal. This facilitates the opportunity to obtain a better understanding of
the mechanism of escape from immune suppression in the context of AML."

Tracheomalacia is the most common structural abnormality in the lower airway. The estimated incidence in
children ranges from 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 2,500. Tracheomalacia is very often associated with congenital
syndromic disorders and congenital tracheomalacia associated with impaired cartilage integrity often
represents the ones with severe symptoms, less regression percentage and higher mortality rate. Currently,
surgical intervention is the only option, which requires disproportionately high allocation of health care
resources. The lack of knowledge on the tracheal cartilage development and the pathophysiological
mechanisms lead to impaired tracheal cartilage integrity prevent searching for alternative interventions for
congenital tracheomalacia. BMP signaling has been demonstrated as a critical growth factor necessary for
chondrogenesis and cartilage development, however, how BMP signaling is regulated during tracheal cartilage
development has not been investigated. EvC syndrome (OMIM 225500) is an autosomal recessive
chondrodysplasia. Neonatal death subsequent to airway collapse has been documented in patients with EvC
syndrome. Our preliminary studies using Evc2 mutant mice uncover the potential novel mechanisms on the
regulated BMP signaling both in foregut mesenchyme and in tracheal mesenchyme. We have demonstrated
that well-orchestrated BMP signaling in foregut and tracheal mesenchyme is necessary for tracheal cartilage
developing into correct shape. Our preliminary studies lead us hypothesize that: Hedgehog-BMP axis at
foregut mesenchyme determines the BMP signaling levels in tracheal mesenchyme and the subsequent
chondrogenesis; after trachea and esophagus separation, extracellularly stored BMP ligands play a critical role
in inducing BMP signaling in tracheal mesenchyme for subsequent chondrogenesis; and that administration of
FK506 has the potential to correct the congenital defective tracheal cartilage in Evc2 mutant mice. This
hypothesis will be investigated by the following three aims: 1) To demonstrate that the Hedgehog-BMP axis
within the foregut mesenchyme is critical for tracheal cartilage development; 2) To evaluate roles of
mesenchymally synthesized and extracellularly stored BMP ligands in inducing chondrogenic differentiation in
tracheal mesenchyme; 3) To demonstrate that pharmacological elevation of BMP signaling will rescue the
defects in tracheal cartilage development. The outcome of the proposed work will uncover the molecular
networks govern the tracheal cartilage development, which will directly set up the knowledge base for the
practical therapeutic solutions."

Pancreatic cancer goes undiagnosed for a number of reasons including, anatomical location, vague and non-
localizing symptoms, and a lack of adequately sensitive and specific biomarkers of disease. Combined with lack
of blood biomarkers, early detection of pancreatic cancer remains a significant challenge. Unfortunately, this
limits therapeutic strategies that are most efficacious. Consequently, approximately 20% of patients with
pancreatic cancer are eligible for curative surgery. Of those patients, approximately 75% will have recurrent
disease within the next 5 years, even those patients thought to have had negative margins. Despite the abysmal
statistics for patients with pancreatic cancer, there are now several pancreatic cancer imaging probes in
preclinical and clinical development to try to improve disease removal. Moreover, the increased use of
neoadjugant or induction thereapy has resulted in additional patients that become eligible for surgery, if they
restage at a lower stage. The opportunity to develop molecularly-targeted probes to pancreatic cancer to improve
surgery and the increased numbers of patients that may benefit from surgery are key motivating factors for this
project. Mucin-16 (MUC16) is an attractive marker for pancreatic cancer since it is highly overexpressed in
malignancies, but not inflamed or healthy pancreas. Recently, we evaluated a murine antiMUC16 antibody,
termed AR9.6, with cross-reactivity to human MUC16. In these preclinical studies, we demonstrated durable
pancreatic cancer enhancement to at least 6 days postinjectin using IRDy800-labelled AR9.6 compared to an
isotype control. Using a pancreatic cancer xenograft, AR9.6-IRDye800 was able to effectively enhance orthotopic
and metastatic disease. Metastasis detection is an added benefit because it would prevent patients from
unecessary surgery. Murine antibodies, however, are not suitable for clinical translation. Consequently, a
humanized form of AR9.6 has now been developed by our collaborative team. An Initial investigation of
IRDye800 conjugated to humanized AR9.6 suggests strong binding to MUC16 and in vivo targeting. Therefore,
the goal of this project is to perform the preclinical development of NIRF-labelled, humanized AR9.6 to
detect PDAC for improved R0 resection and to detect peritoneal metastasis. This goal will be addressed
by three specific aims: To (1) develop and evaluate humanized AR9.6-NIRF for targeting of MUC16; (2) ascertain
the preclinical contrast-enhancement and safety profile of humanized AR9.6-NIRF conjugates; and (3)
demonstrate surgical efficacy of IRDye800-AR9.6 in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize
that the aberrant MUC16 overexpression in pancreatic cancer will allow specific targeting pancreatic cancer with
fluorescently labelled huAR9.6. Completion of this research project will result in a fluorescence-guided surgery
contrast agent that will be able to (1) improve the rate of R0 pancreatic cancer resections and (2) be able to
identify peritoneal metastasis, which will prevent unnecessary surgery and allow optimized treatment strategy."

T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia (T-LGLL) is an incurable, underdiagnosed proliferation of clonal CD8+
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes that results in severe neutropenia and anemia, with resultant recurring infections,
transfusion dependence, and death. There are no FDA-approved therapies for T-LGLL, and current immune-
suppressive based therapies have marginal efficacy. Even if a response is attained with current therapies,
patients shift between immune-suppressive agents, are subject to the adverse effects of these drugs, and for
those with any effect, indefinite therapy is required. Urgent investigation into the pathogenesis of T-LGLL and
development of rational, targeted therapies are needed. T-LGLL is a cytokine-dependent disease, driven by
interleukin-15 (IL-15) which has been identified as the ‘master switch’ crucial to induce and potentiate T-LGLL.
IL-15 induces pathogenesis in T-LGLL through up-regulation of STAT3, with resultant decrease in Fas/Fas-
Ligand mediated apoptosis with resultant T-LGLL proliferation and cytopenias. We evaluated BNZ-1, a
γc-inhibiting peptide that blocks IL-15, in patients with T-LGLL in only the second major, multicenter trial
completed in T-LGLL. Clinical responses were observed in 20% of patients, but in vivo data revealed that nearly
all patients had dramatic apoptosis of T-LGLL cells 24 hours post-BNZ-1, though apoptosis persisted only in
responding patients at day 29. These results (in revision, Blood), provide in vivo proof that BNZ-1 induces T-
LGLL cell apoptosis, and that T-LGLL cells are dependent on IL-15 in vivo in patients. To evaluate the
mechanisms of resistance to IL-15 deprivation induced cell death, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) on samples from a non-responder. We identified the emergence of unique T-LGLL sub-populations
on day 29, with corresponding up-regulation of anti-apoptotic pathways PI3K and NF-kB; implicating up-
regulation of these alternate pathways in T-LGLL as key mechanisms of resistance of T-LGLL to IL-15
deprivation. Yet, validation in a larger sample set is needed to confirm these findings and identify therapeutic
targets. To address these translational and clinical gaps, we will perform scRNAseq and single-cell T-cell
receptor sequencing (scTCRseq) on remaining clinically annotated samples from 3 responders and 3 non-
responders from the BNZ-1 trial to test our hypothesis that resistance to IL-15 deprivation with BNZ-1 is caused
by expansion of resistant T-LGLL populations with upregulation of anti-apoptotic pathways (e.g. NF-kB, PI3K).
In Aim 1, we will perform scRNAseq at serial timepoints (baseline, 24 hours post-BNZ-1, 29 days post BNZ-1),
to identify key anti-apoptotic pathways, genes, and therapeutic targets in resistant populations. In Aim 2, we will
apply scTCRseq to evaluate T-LGLL clonal populations (clonotypes), and determine the impact of IL-15
deprivation on gene expression and anti-apoptotic pathways in these groups. Upon completion, we will gain
crucial mechanistic insights on the critical genes and anti-apoptotic pathways in T-LGLL that lead to resistance
to IL-15 deprivation and identify therapeutic targets for a future NCI R01 proposal and BNZ-1 combinatorial trial."
10794987,"ABSTRACT: Enzymopathies are a disturbance of enzyme function, including genetic deficiency or a defect in
specific enzymes. Current treatment methods are insufficient and rely on hematopoietic stem cell transplant
(HSCT) or lifelong enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). ERT can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year
and HSCTs are highly precarious, with a subset resulting in death from graft versus host disease or infection
brought on by prolonged immunosuppression. An alternative approach would be to modify a patients more
malleable and accessible cells, such as lymphocytes, to express large quantities of active enzyme and re-infuse
these cells into the patient to produce the lacking enzyme. This excess enzyme can be excreted from engineered
cells in vivo and taken up by endogenous cells, a process termed cross correction. Recently, there has been a
large amount of work on genome engineering of human T cells, typically for cancer immunotherapies. However,
the subsets of T cells that are long-lived are metabolically inactive and not ideal for constant protein production.
Conversely, B cells can generate large amounts of protective antibodies and continue to do so for years after
conversion to long-lived plasma cells. It has been demonstrated that these plasma cells are not merely re-seeded
by memory B cells but instead are the result of becoming long-lived antibody producing cells that do not
proliferate. The fact that B cells can become long lived and inherently have the metabolic activity to generate
large quantities of protein (i.e. antibody) led us to hypothesize that these cells might be an ideal platform for gene
therapy of enzymopathies. To enable the use of engineered B cells for therapy we recently established the use
of CRISPR/Cas9 for gene knock-in and knockout in primary human B cells (Johnson et. al., Sci Rep. 2018 Aug
14;8(1):12144). Now, we will apply these approaches to engineer B cells for the treatment of enzymopathies and
perform preclinical testing. Here, we propose to: 1) optimize expression vectors and integration sites for optimal
expression of therapeutic transgenes in human B cells and 2) perform proof-of-concept studies to use
engineered human B cells to treat enzymopathies. Specifically, we will treat a mouse model of
mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) on a NOD/SCID/Il2rγ background by transplantation of engineered human
B cells. MPS I is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disease caused by deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA)
enzyme resulting in accumulation of glycosaminoglycan storage material and multi-systemic disease. Affected
individuals suffer from hepatosplenomegaly, corneal clouding, skeletal dysplasias, cardiopulmonary obstruction,
and in the severe form (Hurler syndrome) progressive neurologic impairment. B cells will be engineered to
express a BCR of known antigen specificity transcriptionally linked to IDUA with subsequent immunization to
generate long lived plasma cells in vivo. The studies proposed in this R01 application thus constitute a
comprehensive analysis of the use of engineered B cells to treat enzymopathies with the ultimate goal of treating
enzymopathies in humans."
10794990,"Project Summary / Abstract
Our skin is a multi-layered structure that acts as a protective barrier against the environment. Barrier function
is typically associated with the surface of the skin; however, it is currently unclear whether the hair follicle also
forms a barrier. Here, we have generated mice that enable spatially and temporally restricted deletion of the
lipid transporter ABCA12, which is mutated in patients with harlequin ichthyosis (HI), the most severe skin
barrier disease. We will utilize these mice as tools to study the contributions of the hair follicle to skin
homeostasis, while examining how hair follicle-related processes are perturbed in HI. We hypothesize that the
hair follicle may affect both normal and ichthyotic skin in the following 4 ways: 1) The upper hair follicle may
directly provide barrier function. 2) The hair follicle may influence the behavior of the adjacent epidermis non-
cell autonomously. 3) The upper hair follicle is likely a site of rapid desquamation that allows for the release of
sebum. 4) The upper hair follicle may assume a wound-like state and contribute cells to the epidermis upon
barrier disruption. Altogether, these studies will contribute fundamental knowledge to our understanding of the
upper hair follicle domain, a poorly studied region of the skin that is perturbed in diseases such as acne,
hidradenitis suppurativa and keratosis pilaris. At the same time, this work will also consider HI from a novel
angle, with a focus on the hair follicle. Finally, our studies will characterize a viable, immunocompetent mouse
model of HI to explore novel therapies."
10795096,"Using a combined ATACseq and RNAseq approach our studies have provided the first evidence that changes
in chromatin accessibility are crucial to the differentiation state-specific expression of a wide variety genes
essential to the transition from lens epithelial to fiber cells. These studies also identified key DNA regulatory
regions and transcription factor binding sites likely to regulate a wide-range of lens genes, most importantly
FOXO4. Genes with requisite roles in lens cell differentiation that contain a consensus DNA binding sequence
for FOXO4 include EPHA2, NrCAM, δ-crystallin, Notch1 and FYCO1. The FOXO family, including FOXO4, is
regulated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of FOXO4 by PI3K/Akt sequesters it in the
cytoplasm and suppression of PI3K/Akt signaling is required for FOXO4 import to the nucleus for its role in
regulating gene expression. The function of FOXO4 has never been examined in the lens. We propose to
establish the role of PI3K/AKT regulation of FOXO4-dependent gene expression in lens fiber cell
differentiation. This will be accomplished by 1) identifying the requirement for PI3K/Akt inhibition for the nuclear
translocation of FOXO4 in the transition of lens epithelial to fiber cells; 2) establishing the link between
PI3K/Akt inhibition and the expression of lens differentiation-specific genes containing FOXO4 binding
sequences; 3) demonstrating the binding of FOXO4 to distinct chromatin accessible DNA regulatory regions in
genes crucial to lens differentiation using targeted-CHIP assays; and 4) establishing the spectrum, range and
spatial expression patterns of genes regulated by FOXO4 during lens cell differentiation. We also discovered
that the PI3K/Akt signaling axis plays an essential role in regulating the timing and mechanism that removes
mitochondria, ER and Golgi from the central light path and that multiple PI3K-downstream signaling pathways
are required for the process of eliminating nuclei to form the lens Organelle Free Zone (OFZ). This process is
required to create a mature lens capable of focusing light images on the retina. We will explore how PI3K
signaling pathways regulate the elimination of nuclei and other organelles to form the lens Organelle Free
Zone in studies aimed at 1) identifying the functions of individual PI3K p110 catalytic subunits in regulating
formation of the OFZ; 2) confirming that the induction of autophagy following inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling
axis is responsible for the removal of mitochondria, ER and Golgi from the developing lens; 3) determining the
link between inactivation of different PI3K signaling pathways and activation of the mechanistic targets required
to eliminate nuclei to form the OFZ; and 4) investigating the potential link between the ring of Akt activity at the
border of cortical and nuclear fiber cells and the regulation of the outer boundary of the OFZ."

 A disturbingly high number of young children around the world experience stunted growth and development
with irreparable consequences through the lifespan. Recent estimates show 250 million children less than five
years of age are not reaching their developmental potential, and 151 million have stunted growth.1,2
Determinants of stunted growth and development are multi-factorial, including interactions between biological,
behavioral, social, and environmental conditions, yet the evidence-base is minimal for integrated approaches
to tackle the interwoven factors. Our group recently found significant impacts from an egg intervention on
young child growth and biomarkers of nutrition and brain development. The effects on important psychosocial
indictors of child development, however, were not assessed. Building on these findings and those of our pilot
study of a group-based, multicomponent intervention (Grandi Byen, Haitian Creole for “grow well”), we propose
a larger RCT to examine a greater breadth of egg intervention outcomes, the synergistic effects of adding
psychoeducational parenting to the egg intervention, and mediating biological, behavioral and social factors.
The 3-arm longitudinal RCT, to be carried out in Cap-Haitien, Haiti, where our group has nine years of
research experience, established partnerships, and a strong research infrastructure. It is representative of
resource-poor urban contexts globally, where parents face common economic and environmental challenges
to child growth and development. The trial will compare the following groups for effectiveness in reducing
young child stunted growth and enhancing overall development: 1) multicomponent Grandi Byen intervention
(responsive parenting, nutrition, hygiene + one egg per day for 6 months); 2) nutrition intervention (one egg per
day for 6 months); and 3) standard well-baby care. Infants will be enrolled between 6-8 months of age and
followed longitudinally for one year. The specific aims are:
 Aim 1 (primary): To demonstrate the reproducibility and feasibility of egg-based interventions in reducing
childhood stunting, and test its impact on development. Hypothesis 1: Linear growth will be increased by 0.30
LAZ in children receiving one egg per day compared to standard care. Hypothesis 2: Children receiving the
egg intervention will have better cognitive, motor and language development compared to standard care.
Question 1 (exploratory): Does an egg-based intervention impact social-emotional development?
 Aim 2 (primary): To investigate the incremental benefit of Grandi Byen compared to egg only and
standard care groups on primary outcomes of child growth and development. Hypothesis 3: Children of
mothers receiving Grandi Byen will increase linear growth by 0.10 LAZ compared to the egg intervention.
Hypothesis 4: Children of mothers receiving Grandi Byen will have higher scores on child cognition, language,
motor, and socio-emotional development, with an effect size of 0.36 on cognition, compared to standard care.
An economic evaluation will be conducted to compare the efficiency of the interventions.
Aim 3 (secondary). To explore pathways of intervention impacts on child growth and development by
delineating the additive and synergistic effects of biological (nutrient biomarkers, bone age, and enteric
disease), psychosocial (responsive parenting, cognitive stimulation), and environmental (hygiene and
sanitation, diet) factors.
 This study expands upon this earlier work by bringing together a transdisciplinary team spanning the
biological and social sciences to work in partnership with Haitian collaborators. We will merge methods and
concepts to produce comprehensive perspectives on several high priority areas including social, economic and
biological factors that impact child brain development and function, nutrition among infants and very young
children, determinants of bone health; and traumatic stress associated with growing up in abject poverty."
10924057,"Despite increased awareness and provision of resources, there remain significant disparities in the
demographics of the workforce in science, engineering, technology, and mathematics, medicine (STEMM).
These disparities are the result of a “leaky pipeline” in which there is attrition of certain historically
underrepresented groups at each stage of training and career advancement. In 2019-2020, 71% of doctoral
degrees in STEMM fields were awarded to individuals who were categorized as White race and ethnicity. In
2019, although a higher number of women obtained a doctoral degree in a STEMM field compared to men, more
than twice as many people employed in management or higher positions in the same fields were male compared
to female. Prior studies showed that diversity within teams has many benefits, including innovation and strong
information processing. Several conceptual frameworks have identified social supports that are mediated by
enhanced self-efficacy and scientific identity to improve persistence to pursue a career in a STEMM field. Career
development programs that offer evidence-based interventions that are rooted in these empirical models may
be an individual-level approach to increase representation of historically underrepresented groups in biomedical
sciences. The purpose of this project is to offer mentorship to early career trainees who are conducting research
within the mission of NIDDK. The potential impact of this project is increased representation of early-career
researchers from diverse backgrounds conducting research relevant to the priority areas of NIDDK. Specifically,
this project targets individuals who are at the predoctoral and postdoctoral level and pursuing the next phase of
progression towards becoming a Principal Investigator. The long-term potential implications include the potential
to realize both direct benefits for program scholars as well as broader indirect effects for future researchers."

Iron-sulfur enzymes perform some of the most challenging transformations in biology. Of these, [Fe4S4]
enzymes are the most ubiquitous and catalyze dozens of known transformations (and likely many more) that
play direct and indirect roles in human health and disease. This proposal concerns the mechanisms of the >
100,000 members of the radical S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) superfamily of enzymes. Understanding their
reaction mechanisms on a molecular level is critical for identifying disease targets and designing mechanism-
based inhibitors. An emerging theme in mechanistic studies of these enzymes is the intermediacy of species
containing Fe–alkyl bonds whereby generation of the reactive 5’-deoxyadenosyl radical may proceed by
homolytic Fe–C bond cleavage. However, the exact electronic and geometric structure of this intermediate, its
function in catalysis, the strength of its Fe–C bond, and the mechanisms by which these steps might occur are
not clear, and there is no precedent in synthetic Fe–S clusters for this structure type or reactivity. We therefore
propose to address these questions using structurally and functionally faithful synthetic [Fe4S4]–alkyl
complexes. We will prepare [Fe4S4]–alkyl complexes with rationally tunable properties and formulate and test
hypotheses concerning the geometric and electronic structure requirements for achieving Fe–C bond
homolysis. These requirements will be elucidated through systematic kinetic and spectroscopic studies.
Overall, this work will reveal the role of organometallic chemistry in catalysis by radical SAM enzymes and
yield insights into how Nature utilizes reactive Fe–C bonds in human health and disease."

 Delayed identification of infant head malformation is causing unnecessary medical complications and societal
costs. A critical challenge in the early detection is the absence of tools available to pediatric offices to perform
quantitative head shape assessment during well-child visits. Delays in diagnosis limit the opportunity for early,
less invasive and effective treatment options. In this Fast-track SBIR project, PediaMetrix Inc. has joined forces
with pediatric hospitals and providers to develop and evaluate SoftSpotTM, which is the first mobile digital tool for
3D data collection and analysis of infant cranial malformations at the point-of-care.
 Head malformations during infancy can be synostotic (i.e., craniosynostosis) or nonsynostotic (such as
deformational plagiocephaly and brachycephaly or DPB). Both types of conditions require immediate attention
and benefit from early treatment to avoid long-term health complications. The prevalence of DPB increased
dramatically in recent years, from 5% to approximately 20%-30%, causing the condition to be called a pediatric
epidemic. Craniosynostosis is less common affecting 1 in 2,000 children. To improve the early management of
these conditions and to prevent more complex treatment and associated morbidities, it is essential to monitor
the growth of the infant head at the point-of-care.
 To address this unmet clinical need, we will develop and evaluate a mobile digital tool that will enable
pediatricians to capture and analyze 3D scans of every infant for the early diagnosis and management of cranial
malformations. In the Phase I of this project, we will develop a novel technology to rapidly capture and analyze
3D data of the top of cranium in just seconds. We will use machine learning methods to automatically compute
the head shape parameters, including the head circumference which is routinely performed during every child
visit, but currently with an outdated and unreliable measuring tape. Our technology will be designed for the
general cranial evaluation of all infants during well-child visits. In Phase II, we will develop methods for the 3D
reconstruction and analysis of the full cranium from a smartphone. We will also train deep learning models to
classify types of craniosynostosis and other cranial conditions and conduct clinical evaluation and user-feasibility
studies.
 The overall mission of PediaMetrix is to provide accurate decision support tools for pediatric health at the
point-of-care. This will be achieved through machine learning and quantitative imaging algorithms that in
combination with smartphone technological advances will be packaged as mobile digital health solutions
accessible to pediatric health providers at any time and location. Successful demonstration of SoftSpot3DTM will
lead to a significant reduction of the number of children left with untreated cranial conditions in addition to

Sound localization – determining where in space a sound originates – is a cardinal task of the auditory system.
While much progress has been made in uncovering the fundamental neural processes that mediate sound
localization, there still remain significant gaps that limit our understanding of the underlying circuit. Here we
focus on the role played by one key component of the sound localization circuit, the medial nucleus of the
trapezoid body (MNTB), and its inhibitory output.
The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that fast MNTB inhibition is essential for the neural
computation of ITDs and IIDs at the two sound main localization nuclei, the medial and lateral superior olive
(MSO and LSO, respectively). In addition, we propose that MNTB inhibition will have a sufficiently large effect
on the generation of wave III of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), such that suppression of MNTB will
alter this wave. ABRs are a method that non-invasively measure in-vivo the activity of brain stem neurons, and
we focus on wave III because in rodents this wave is commonly associated with activity of neurons in the sound
localization nuclei.
To test the hypothesis, we will optogenetically manipulate MNTB and record MSO activity to discriminate
between several competing models of sound localization by MSO neurons (Aim 1). Then we will optogenetically
manipulate MNTB and record low-frequency LSO activity to study a population of low-frequency LSO neurons
(Aim 2). Finally, we will optogenetically suppress MNTB and record responses and effects on the ABR (Aim 3).
This manipulation mimics similar ABR alterations in common hearing conditions affecting binaural hearing.
Overall, the aims are designed to enhance our understanding of sound localization mechanisms in the auditory
brainstem, the brain area that performs the first separation of multiple sounds from each other based on their
spatial location. There are a number of medical conditions in which alterations in this pathway lead to a
patient's decreased ability to localize sound and function in a noisy environment. A better understanding of the
neural mechanisms in this circuit in the healthy auditory system will help design treatments for these
conditions in the future."

The project addresses vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) using a design that
enrolls persons with the autosomal dominant gene for Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with
Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Exploration of VCID by focusing on the rare heritable
monogenic disorder, CADASIL, will advance knowledge of the full spectrum of this vascular dementia from
asymptomatic gene carriers through dementia and will facilitate studies evaluating vascular contributions in
different neurodegenerative processes including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD).
CADASIL is caused by a mutation in the gene Notch3, which encodes a receptor protein expressed in vascular
smooth muscle cells and pericytes. When mutated, expression of the gene leads to generalized degeneration of
vascular smooth muscle cells affecting small and medium sized arteries. To provide insights into the impact of
small vessel disease (SVD) in CADASIL (and AD, ADRD, and VCID more generally) on parenchymal damage
and cognitive decline, non-invasive Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides quantification of brain
structure, function, and some measures of vascular health; however, current clinically available MRI techniques
lack sensitivity and specificity to address key vascular hypotheses as many measures only indirectly study
cerebrovascular disease, primarily focusing on the damage already caused by SVD, not the vessels themselves.
Our group is uniquely positioned to address these key gaps in our knowledge base, both due to our MRI
technology and as a member of the first CADASIL consortium study in North America. We propose an ensemble
of novel MRI techniques optimized to provide vascular specific measures in a non-invasive imaging protocol. By
characterizing in vivo measures of vascular stiffening at the macrovascular and microvascular levels in CADASIL,
we will provide insights into the degree and mechanisms of VCID and establish baseline data to compare the
longitudinal time course of CADASIL with normal age-related cerebrovascular changes, including SVD. We
previously found that our MRI stiffness measures can detect vascular changes in amyloid positive AD participants
even prior to demonstrating cognitive dysfunction. Our pilot data in CADASIL suggests pronounced vascular
disease involving all levels of the cerebrovascular system. In close collaboration with three additional CADASIL
consortium sites, a multidisciplinary team at the University of Wisconsin will first utilize newly developed, state-
of-the art, quantitative MRI vascular imaging methods to understand the distribution and severity of vascular
changes in CADASIL (Aim 1). We will then study the influence of altered intracranial vasculature on CADASIL
neurodegeneration and cognition (Aim 2), and finally, we will study the degree of vascular involvement in
CADASIL in comparison to cognitively unimpaired, normal aging participants (Aim 3). Upon completion we will
be uniquely positioned to incorporate these techniques into large cohort studies investigating SVD, VCID, and
extending into other ADRD vascular mechanisms as well as evaluate risk and protective factors."
10807273,"ABSTRACT: Colorectal cancers are the third most frequently occurring cancer in the military, occurring in up to
8% of Veterans. Veteran rectal cancer patients are often diagnosed earlier relative to the general population, but
do not have improved survival rates; indicating limitations of the existing “one-size-fits-all” therapeutic protocol.
The lack of personalized therapy in rectal cancers disproportionately impacts Veteran colorectal cancer patients
who tend to be older (median age 67.5 years) and often have a higher comorbidity burden than the general U.S.
population. A major clinical question thus remains selection of an appropriate combination of neoadjuvant
therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery to ensure optimal patient outcomes for Veteran rectal cancer patients.
For instance, total neoadjuvant therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation) can enable ~30% of
rectal cancer patients to achieve a pathologic complete response (no residual tumor). These patients are ideal
candidates for organ-preserving strategies and non-operative management, such as a “watch-and-wait” (W&W)
protocol. Conversely, up to 20% of patients may not exhibit any pathologic regression after neoadjuvant therapy,
but instead suffer tumor invasion to surrounding structures (lymphatic, vascular, or perineural) and thus a higher
chance of life-threatening distant metastasis. Both of these issues particularly impact Veteran rectal cancer
patients due their increased age, additional financial and psychological stresses, and survival benefits when
administered targeted adjuvant therapy to combat metastasis. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of clinically
validated markers predictive or diagnostic of response to chemoradiation in rectal cancers and MR imaging has
limited sensitivity/specificity for detecting treatment response or mutational/invasion status. This suggests a
critical need for accurate and objective non-invasive markers to (a) identify Veteran rectal cancer patients who
have achieved complete response after neoadjuvant therapy so they can be safely recommended W&W, as well
as (b) predict which Veteran patients will see added benefit from chemotherapy beyond chemoradiation alone.
Our initial set of novel artificial intelligence-based descriptors (known as radiomics) that capture heterogeneity,
morphometry, as well as specialized measurements of lesion complexity on MRI have shown significant success
for (a) distinguishing pathologic responders to chemoradiation with up to AUC=0.86, (b) predicting high-risk
metastatic rectal tumors with up to AUC=0.81, as well as (c) capturing heterogeneity in pathologic tissue
organization associated with response and metastasis well as mutation status (N>200 patients, 3 institutions
including the Northeast Ohio VA). In this VA Merit Award, we propose to develop and optimize our AI radiomic
descriptors to build clinically actionable computational image Rectal Response Classifier (ciRRC) tools to
help (a) proactively select high-risk Veterans who will gain additional benefit from targeted chemotherapy based
on predicted chemoradiation resistance or tumor invasion, and (b) identify Veteran rectal cancer patients with
minimal/dying tumor regions who can be safely recommended non-operative organ-preserving management.
In Aim 1, we will optimize our specialized heterogeneity, morphometry, and lesion complexity radiomic features
to capture imaging signatures from pathologically mapped tumor habitats on MRI (via spatial alignment of ex
vivo digitized whole-mount specimens with MRI) and thus distinguish pathologic tumor response of rectal tumors
using a multi-institutional cohort of rectal cancer patients. In Aim 2, we will develop a ciRRC-Dx model for
identifying patients at high-risk for distant metastasis or non-response and thus will see added benefit from
adjuvant chemotherapy; using baseline MRI scans from retrospectively accrued Veteran rectal cancer patients.
Additionally, we will evaluate biological associations of ciRRC features with mutation status (of KRAS, BRAF,
and NRAS genes) as well as physiological invasion (lymph, vascular, perineural). In Aim 3, we will develop a
ciRRC-Tx model for selecting complete responder patients who could be candidates for W&W, which will be
validated on a multi-institutional cohort of Veteran rectal cancer patients from across Midwest VAHS centers."
10807747,"Lumbosacral spinal stenosis (LSS) is a leading cause of limited mobility, reduced independence, and poor
health outcomes in older adults; and is especially prevalent in older adult Veterans. Several years ago, major
randomized clinical trials indicated that surgical intervention for LSS was more effective than usual (medical)
management. Nonetheless, there are many patients for whom surgery is not the ideal therapy. In some cases,
patients are not `good surgical candidates' due the presence multiple medical conditions such as [uncontrolled
type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2)]. Other patients are considered less ideal for surgery because pain is a
prominent feature of their low back syndrome while simultaneously walking limitations, e.g., neurogenic
claudication, is less prominent. There is evidence that these patients are less likely to have good surgical
outcomes, and yet little is known about what other therapies might be effective. It is precisely the sickest and
most vulnerable patients with LSS who are in greatest need of alternative therapies. We propose a therapeutic
trial utilizing a low-cost, well-established non-invasive clinical device, repurposed for the relief of LSS-
associated pain. Current RR&D emphasis includes non-pharmacological treatments to improve
rehabilitation outcomes including pain and mobility. This proposal is based on the latest in peripheral
nerve research but takes a non-invasive approach to address a problem impacting a substantive percentage of
the millions of older adults with low back pain and dysmobility. Our specific aims include:
1. Gather and evaluate preliminary evidence that non-invasive postural therapy (NIPT) improves
rehabilitation outcomes including pain ratings and mobility over a 6-week pilot study of older adult
Veterans with LSS. In this study, 20 [older adult Veterans will receive instruction and equipment to support
holo-diurnal (all day-and-night) activity modification, e.g., modified walker use, adapted meal preparation /
leisure activities, and sleep positioning, to enhance sagittal flexion continuously and comfortably. Following 1
week baseline activity and sleep assessment, an initial 3-week treatment period (NIPT) will include activity
monitoring and daily pain assessment. During a second 3-week period, patients will use NIPT ad libitum,
activity and sleep monitoring will be repeated during week 6. The primary outcome measure is participant
mobility measured by actigraphy and pedometer. Secondary outcomes are patient-reported pain intensity and
interference, mobility, quality of life (PROMIS, EQ5D), and system usability; walker usage as measured by
tracking devices; as well as objective assessments of sleep duration and quality as measured by activity
monitoring.]
2. [Assess feasibility of, barriers to, and facilitators of non-invasive postural therapy (NIPT) holo-
diurnal implementation for older adult Veterans. The primary outcome in this arm of the study will be to
identify, through mixed methods approaches - the feasibility, barriers, and facilitators to implementing this
treatment intervention. We will recruit Veterans and health care providers (HCPs), e.g., primary care providers,
and physical therapists, for key informant interviews as well as questionnaires assessing feasibility of NIPT and
the extent to which HCPs view this as an option for older adult Veterans with dysmobility, pain, and
multimorbidity.]
The evidence gathered in this trial will support the development of future studies of non-pharmacological
therapies for older adult Veterans with low back pain and low back conditions."
10807440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emotional disorders are among the primary causes of disability and impairment worldwide. Predicting their future
course can be used to improve disease management and to deliver more timely and individually tailored
treatment. However, accurate forecasting is notoriously difficult. A major challenge is that the static features
traditionally used for prediction (i.e., cross-sectional symptom data) are not theoretically optimal for forecasting
disease progression. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that emotional disorders are characterized by
behaviors that unfold dynamically over time. A more principled disorder conceptualization is needed that
emphasizes dynamic time-series features of emotional psychopathology. To address this gap, dynamical
systems and complex network theory have been proposed as theoretical models that can explain the dynamic
behavior of emotional disorders. In the current proposal, we will create a precision-medicine framework for
predicting emotional disorder symptoms that leverages theoretically relevant time-series measures using
modern “forecasting” machine learning methods. Patients with emotional disorders will be recruited to undergo
a 4-week ecological momentary assessment period during which symptom and affect data will be collected 5
times per day and passive sensor data will be continuously monitored. Aim 1 will evaluate the predictive utility of
“forecasting” machine learning using EMA-based dynamical systems and network features in predicting future
transdiagnostic symptom domains. Aim 2 will evaluate the added predictive utility of incorporating dynamic time-
series features from passive sensor data alongside EMA data in predicting future transdiagnostic symptom
domains. In Aim 3, we will develop dynamic time-series phenotypes of emotional disorders using both self-
reported EMA and sensor data. The current proposal will result in the first forecasting machine learning
framework designed to leverage temporally dynamic features for predicting the future course of symptoms,
thereby better capturing the dynamic nature of emotional psychopathology. This is significant as it facilitates
more accurate monitoring and just-in-time interventions for emotional disorders, alleviating one of the major
causes of disease and burden worldwide. Furthermore, a tailored training plan was created to cultivate
competencies in advanced time-series computational techniques and career development, including expertise
in (1) early warning signals in dynamical systems and network theory, (2) time-series machine learning
(forecasting), (3) unsupervised machine learning, (4) passive sensor data, and (5) grantsmanship and transition
to academic independence, with guidance from Dr. Paola Pedrelli (primary mentor), Dr. Richard McNally (co-
mentor), Dr. Jordan Smoller (co-mentor), and Drs. Rosalind Picard and Amanda Baker (consultants). Research
and training activities will harness the exceptional resources at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical
School. This training plan will facilitate a future research program leveraging computational modeling to advance
precision medicine and personalized care for emotional disorders."
10809682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
More than 2 million children under 5 die each year in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Children recently discharged
from hospital suffer a particularly high risk of death and no interventions target this period. Recent clinical trials
found 13%-49% mortality reductions associated with community-wide singe-dose azithromycin in SSA, and
mechanisms of this effect are poorly understood. The Toto Bora trial (NIH/NICHD-HD079695) is a double-blind
placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT) testing the effect of a 5-day course of azithromycin
administered at hospital discharge to Kenyan children under 5 years on mortality and re-hospitalization in the
subsequent 6-months. Utilizing samples from this trial, we have the unprecedented opportunity to elucidate
mechanisms of post-discharge morbidity, mortality, and growth faltering AND determine mechanisms of
azithromycin’s effect. We will test for enteropathogens and resistance genes in fecal samples and Escherichia
coli collected from children at hospital discharge and 3-months thereafter using qPCR and link this molecular
data to re-hospitalization, vital status, and anthropometric data collected throughout the 6-month post-discharge
period. Results from this highly efficient nested study will inform targets for vaccines and pathogen-directed
medications that could reduce post-discharge morbidity and mortality. Specific molecularly-determined pathogen
or resistance markers that predict azithromycin’s effects on mortality, morbidity, and growth will elucidate
mechanisms by which empiric azithromycin reduces child mortality and may identify specific populations who
can be treated with azithromycin to maximize benefit while minimizing resistance."
10809684,"Project Summary: Students with blindness face explicit bias and systemic exclusion in chemistry. The
chemistry laboratory remains especially inaccessible—“off limits”—to students with BLV. The exquisite 3D
imagery of chemistry also remains inaccessible, as visualizing each image in a textbook would require a
large hand-held model. Excluding students from the “central” science—from its tools, data, and imagery—
can inhibit learning in other STEM fields. In the state of Texas, 11,000 children and young adults (age 0-
22) have blindness or low vision (BLV). The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI)
educates ~ 600 K-12 students per year. The objectives of this project are to increase access to chemistry
labs, instrumentation, data, and imagery for high school students at TSBVI (grades 9-12). The project
team involves: (i) five PhD-level chemists (three have been completely blind from childhood or birth), (ii)
one special educator at Baylor University, (iii) five TSBVI teachers and accessibility specialists, and (iv)
the Laboratory Safety Program Manager at Baylor University. Special Research Experiences (SRE’s)
have been planned at Baylor University for 30 new TSBVI high school students per year. These two-day
experiences will be accompanied by pre-lab and post-lab tactile curriculum, safety training, and role
modeling from PhD chemists with blindness. In Aim 1, accessible curriculum is being developed for SRE’s
via 3D printing, tactile printing, Braille printing, and audio recording. In Aim 1, millimeter-scale “micro
models” of 3D images are also being designed and developed (as an alternative to conventional large
tactile models). The ability of TSBVI students to visualize these micro models by oral and manual
stereognosis is tested during SRE’s. In Aim 2, lab spaces at Baylor are being modified to be accessible
to TSBVI students, to conduct the four SRE’s described in Aim 3. Outfitting the lab involves use of “high
tech” solutions (e.g., robots that weigh, dispense and mix solids and liquids) and “low tech lab hacks”. In
Aim 3, four different Special Research Experiences will be provided to 15 new TSBVI students per
semester (students assigned a different SRE each year). Two SRE’s involve the synthesis of industrially
important molecules, using a robotic reactor at Baylor University that is safely enclosed inside an air-tight,
blast-proof glove box. Two other SRE’s allow students to use electron and atomic force microscopy and
tactile printing to visualize nanoscale molecular assemblies (e.g., protein fibrils and carbohydrate scales
of butterfly wings). The four experiences will provide students with knowledge of microscopy; mass
spectrometry; simple organic reactions; and protein aggregation. Students will learn that they can visualize
the highest resolution imagery from microscopy via tactile graphics. Students will learn that they can safely
do chemical synthesis using robots inside glove boxes. The hypothesis, tested in a randomized control
trial, is that SRE’s will increase TSBVI student interest, confidence, and sense of belonging in STEM."
10810302,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A central goal in HIV/AIDS vaccine research is the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). During
the previous funding period, the Bjorkman lab used novel design strategies to develop HIV-1 envelope (Env)
trimer-based immunogens to elicit bNAbs against single and multiple epitopes, including the V3 glycan patch,
CD4 binding site (CD4bs), and triple V3/CD4bs/V1V2 targets. In publications among the 32 supported by the
current HIVRAD, the Bjorkman and Nussenzweig labs were the first to show that sequential immunizations
with multimerized immunogens on protein nanoparticles elicited heterologous neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in
inferred germline (iGL) mice, and more impressively, in wildtype (wt) animals with polyclonal Ab repertoires
[mice, rabbits, and rhesus macaques (RMs)]. However, the elicited cross-neutralizing Abs did not confer
protection from heterologous viral challenge, due at least in part to increasing off-target responses following
multiple boosts and the failure of the cross-neutralizing Abs to affinity mature to achieve high potency, breadth,
and durability. This led to the discovery by Nussenzweig of Ab feedback and epitope masking, which attenuate
focused B cell responses, a concept now becoming entrenched in the HIV-1 vaccine field. The goal of this
renewal application is to build on these fundamental discoveries and design more strategic and effective priming
and boosting immunogens. To accomplish this, we added a third collaborating research team
(Hahn/Shaw/Weissman) that brings expertise in the SHIV model of bNAb induction and mRNA immunogen
design. We will gain unique synergies from these highly collaborative research teams as follows: Project 1
(Bjorkman) will design next-generation prime and boost immunogens based on structural and biophysical
analyses of GL-targeted and lineage-based Env-Ab recognition from Project 2; Project 2
(Hahn/Shaw/Weissman) will decipher molecular pathways of Env-Ab coevolution shared among different SHIV-
infected RMs that develop neutralization breadth as a “molecular guide” for novel lineage-based immunogen
design in Project 1 and will test these new protein nanoparticle and mRNA vaccine platforms for immunogenicity
and protection in RMs; and Project 3 (Nussenzweig) will delineate the impacts of Ab feedback, epitope masking,
and T follicular helper (Tfh) cell repertoire on enhancing or attenuating on-target B cell responses. These projects
will be enabled by a Protein Expression and Automated Assays Core A (Vielmetter) and an Administrative
Core B (Bjorkman). Our hypothesis is that by incorporating lineage-based Env “immunotypes” that elicited
bNAbs in SHIV infected RMs in novel nanoparticle and mRNA-LNP vaccine designs (Projects 1 and 2) and by
modulating epitope masking and Tfh responses in germinal centers (Projects 1 and 3), we can develop new
prime and boost immunogens that lead to neutralization breadth, potency, and durability in wt animals. Achieving
this goal would represent a major scientific advance directly translatable to vaccine efforts in humans."
10811357,"Project Summary:This A1 proposal focuses on impaired pathological fracture healing in the presence of breast
cancer cells, not on the entire complex sequence of cancer spread from the breast to bone. Metastatic cancer
cells can settle in anywhere in the bone including bone marrow, cortical bone, or outside of the bone. Cancer
cells are spilled in and out of bone at the time of fracture. Pathological fracture calluses are deficient and very
often fail to ossify despite adjuvant therapies such radiation therapy and anti-resorptive agents including
Rank:Fc antibody (denosumab) or bisphosphonates (zoledronate). Failed fracture healing is not solely a result
of bone resorption. There is no mechanistic understanding as to why fractures do not heal well in the presence
of certain types of breast cancer cells. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying impaired fracture healing will
enable patients to benefit from future scientific endeavors employing mechanism-based treatments. If there is a
way of addressing impaired fracture repair while also inhibiting cancer growth in bone, the clinical care for
pathological fractures will be immensely impacted. We conducted whole transcriptome bulk RNAsequencing of
several different types of breast cancer cells that are grown in breast vs. bone. We observed that breast cancer
cells that inhibit fracture repair are pro-inflammatory with heightened MEK1-pERK1/2-cytokine-
hyperinflammation signaling in the bone microenvironment. Temporal expression of pro-Inflammatory cytokines
and bone-acting proteins such as TNF, interleukins, and sclerostin are completely deranged and prolonged
following femur fractures in the presence of breast cancer cells such as MDA231, HC1806, and 4T1 However,
there is a critical knowledge gap as to how these different breast cancer cell types affect chondro-progenitors,
osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes within the intact fracture callus architecture as suggested by the
Reviewer. Two notable changes in this A1 proposal include the refinement of the animal models and a new set
of compelling spatial transcriptomic biology data incorporating the Reviewers’ critiques and suggestions. We
posit a central hypothesis that highly inflammatory pERK1/2-high breast cancer cells inhibit the normal fracture
callus formation and maturation by causing prolonged hyper-inflammation and subsequent derangements of
callus spatial transcriptomics. We propose 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1. To define temporal and spatial
transcriptomic changes of inflammatory, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineage cells in structurally intact
fracture callus in vivo. Aim 2. To rescue impaired osteogenesis of osteoprogenitors, chondroprogenitors, and
periosteal cells in the presence breast cancer cells by inhibition of pERK1/2-induced inflammation ex vivo. Aim
3. In Vivo Pre-clinical Therapeutic Translation: To establish a mechanism-based rescue of impaired
pathological fracture healing by targeting specific pro-inflammatory kinases in vivo. We expect to establish a
novel therapeutic paradigm for devastating patients suffering from cancer and pathological fractures."
10811021,"Social health—the quantity and quantity of social ties—is a strong predictor of overall well-being, including
both physical and mental health [80,81]. Our goal is to understand how established adulthood (early 30s)
social health corresponds to patterns of adverse young adulthood (ages 18-23) intimate relationship
experiences (AYREs)—conflict and violent victimization, partner dominance, churning, and partner cheating.
 We will use three data sources: (1) The NICHD-funded Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL)
project’s existing 2.5 years of weekly longitudinal survey data on a random sample of 992 18- and 19-year-old
women living in a county in Michigan, (2) Existing in-depth interviews with a disadvantaged sub-sample of 75
RDSL respondents who experienced a pregnancy or had high model-based propensity for pregnancy. And (3)
New in-depth re-interviews of the disadvantaged subsample. The subsample is especially important because
their children (n=66 total children by the end of RDSL) will experience their mothers’ AYREs as adverse
childhood experiences (ACEs), which are strongly linked to long-term impaired mental and physical health.
 For our first aim, we will first use sequence analysis methods and the existing survey data (n=942 ever-
partnered respondents) to identify and describe theoretically meaningful, and empirically representative
patterns of AYREs. Next, we will use the existing RDSL in-depth interview data (n=75) to describe the
respondents and their AYREs within each pattern observed in the disadvantaged subsample, in detail. And we
will compare the patterns present in the subsample against all of the patterns present in the main sample to
assess selectivity in AYREs for respondents with disadvantaged family background, young pregnancy, and
associated adolescent experiences with penile-vaginal sex and pregnancy.
 For our second aim, we will collect and analyze new in-depth re-interviews with the high-risk subsample
(n=75), focused on social health. We will compare social health across the AYRE patterns from Aim 1 that are
present in the high-risk subsample, to test our overarching hypothesis that AYREs correspond to poorer
established adulthood social health, net of disadvantage. We will identify respondents whose experiences do
not match our hypotheses—“surprising” results—using an abductive approach to generate new ideas and
explain/interpret the context and meaning of the in-depth interview data.
 Our proposed project is innovative in its: (1) focus on life course changes in a broad range of intimate
relationships, including non-marital and non-coresidential relationships; (2) expansion of the ACE framework
to incorporate AYREs; (3) an innovative data reduction technique (sequence analysis) to summarize up to 130
weeks of data on eight weekly varying measures of AYREs for 942 respondents, (4) focus on a disadvantaged
and important subpopulation to “control for” disadvantage, an important potential confounder of a link
between AYREs and social health, and (5) an innovative approach to theory generation (abductive analysis)."
10811168,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotic cells are home to a diversity of organelles, symbionts, and pathogens that are often co-inherited
across cell lineages and from parent to progeny. Across humans, animal models, and arthropod vectors of
pathogens, intracellular microbial community dynamics are associated with numerous effects on host
physiology that ultimately result in disease. These include mitochondrial diseases, exacerbated clinical
symptoms of co-acquired pathogens, altered transmission dynamics of vector-borne pathogens, interactive
effects on host immunity and metabolism, and even dysbiosis of the host gut microbiome. There is great
interest in defining the factors that promote or inhibit co-inheritance of intracellular bacteria due to the
combination of their direct and indirect effects on animal health and for their potential use as anti-pathogen
agents. We propose to use a suite of insect models to investigate the factors that regulate co-inheritance of
intracellular microbes with a focus on Wolbachia: alpha-proteobacteria, related to the intracellular human
pathogens Anaplasma, Rickettsia, and Ehrlichia. Unlike their close relatives, Wolbachia inhabit the cells of
arthropods and nematodes and manipulate host biology to facilitate vertical transmission via the maternal
germline. The consequences of Wolbachia infections are diverse and include reproductive isolation between
host populations, matriline sweeps, protection against secondary infections with pathogens, and even host
speciation. Furthermore, some arthropods harbor multiple, stably co-transmitted strains of Wolbachia that must
compete for host resources and space in the germline. Importantly, these Wolbachia-mediated phenotypes are
currently being applied to manage vector-borne pathogens, and, there is significant applied interest in
leveraging coinfections of Wolbachia to fine-tune and expand management programs. Given the applied
interest in Wolbachia and its broad success as an endosymbiont of ecdysozoans, they are an attractive model
for understanding the mechanisms of coinfection. Our long-term goals are to define the mechanisms behind
host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions that ultimately determine inheritance and evolution of these
associations. This proposal derives from our published work and preliminary data that has given us techniques
to manipulate and track intracellular infections, our ability to perturb a naturally stable coinfection, and our
discovery that intra-organismal niche partitioning plays a key role in coinfection stability. We propose to use a
combination of techniques including high throughput analysis of transcriptomes, multiplexing spectral
microscopy, and molecular and cell biology approaches to accomplish the following Specific Aims: (1) Define
factors that facilitate co-establishment of intracellular microbes, (2) Identify features of stable coinfections that
facilitate evolutionary stability. We anticipate this work will identify conserved mechanisms that regulate
intracellular infections, as well as provide foundational knowledge to support the development of therapeutic
strategies focused on intracellular microbes."
10813124,"ABSTRACT
Neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), anxiety and depression
cost hundreds of billions of dollars each year in medical, economic and social costs. Despite
progress, treatments for these conditions remain limited. Hence safer, more specific drugs
would have high clinical utility. One critical, drug-able target is the metabotropic glutamate
receptor, mGlu5, antagonists of which robustly improve animal models of these disorders;
however the results of initial clinical trials have been mixed. Rather than invalidating mGlu5 as a
therapeutic target, such results highlight the need for a better understanding of mGlu5 function,
including its subcellular localization. For example, we have shown that 70-90% of mGlu5 is
located on intracellular membranes, where it couples to signaling systems distinct from those of
its cell surface counterpart. Importantly, intracellular mGu5 is sufficient for establishing long term
depression (LTD), a form of synaptic plasticity that is dysfunctional in ASD, anxiety and
depression. The objective of the proposed research is to establish the role that intracellular
mGlu5 plays by identifying differences in its function on the cell surface vs. inside the cell, in
vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that mGlu5 interacts with different signaling
pathways depending on where it is located and that this results in distinct regulation of synaptic
processes and related behaviors. To test this hypothesis we have developed a genetically
restricted mouse line in which mGlu5 is present only on intracellular membranes (mGlu5IM). We
will use this newly derived animal line in the following aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether
mGlu5IM vs. mGlu5WT or mGlu5KO has different effects on signaling pathways in vitro (cultured
neurons) by testing proposed candidate genes and by using unbiased transcriptome profiling
(RNA-Seq) to identify new pathways. In Aim 2, we will use ex vivo slice preparations to
determine whether mGlu5IM vs. mGlu5WT or mGlu5KO variants play unique roles and signal
through distinctive pathways in synaptic processes such as LTD. In Aim 3, we will determine
whether the variant mice exhibit unique effects on sensorimotor, anxiety-like and depressive-like
behaviors as well as on operant models of reward. This would be the first report of location-
specific functions of intracellular mGlu5 in vivo. As mGlu5 is one of a growing number of
receptors that signal from inside the cell, the proposed experiments will also enhance
knowledge of other intracellular receptors. Future studies targeting drugs to intracellular vs. cell-
surface-localized receptors are expected to lead to the development of better drugs for mGlu5-
modulated disorders such as ASD and depression,"
10813129,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Healthcare costs for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) ascribed to benign prostatic hyperplasia/hypertrophy
(BPH) are billions of dollars annually. BPH/LUTS is a debilitating disease that affects nearly all aged men. BPH
can be a lethal disease (kidney disease/urinary retention) and world-wide it has been estimated that more men
die from BPH than prostate cancer. Therapies for BPH/LUTS target smooth muscle contractility with α-blockers
or hyperplasia with 5α-reductase inhibitors. Although these therapies can be medicinal, they are not
effective/durable for all; this leaves millions of men needing more effective therapies. Estrogens and downstream
targets are important in the development and progression of BPH/LUTS, yet there are no medical treatments
directed at these pathways. The standard of medical care for BPH/LUTS currently over-treats the BPH/LUTS
patient population, in part due to a poor understanding of etiology and progression of the disease. There is an
apparent need to define what BPH represents in patient populations as well as to identify the true anatomic,
cellular, and molecular causes of the disease. Clarification here may elucidate the true causes in development
and progression of this disease as well as institute effective strategies and therapies. We and others have
previously demonstrated prostatic collagen deposition coincident with prostate stiffness, LUTS, and failed
medical treatment supporting the concept that BPH/LUTS is, in part, a fibrotic disease. Moreover we propose
estrogens mediate prostate fibrosis and associated LUTD. The goal of this research is to identify the anatomical,
cellular, and molecular origins of prostate fibrosis in men with BPH/LUTS and understand its regulation by the
estrogen pathway. Recently, estrogens, specifically signaling through estrogen receptor (ER)-α, was discovered
to be necessary for the development of LUTD in mice. Although, multiple stromal and epithelial cells express
ER-α, we provide evidence that ER-α positive stromal cells are responsible for increased collagen deposition.
These cells are sensitive to estrogens and produce large amounts of collagen in vitro and in vivo. Therefore we
propose to identify the tissue specific ER-? regulation of prostate fibrosis/LUTD. At the same time we will
determine if fibrosis/collagen accumulation acts independently or in collaboration with prostate hyperplasia.
Additionally, we will determine the ER molecular mechanism of action in the transcription of Col1a1 by
determining if classical or non-classical ER signaling is necessary. We will also determine if therapeutic selective
ER-? modulators (SER?Ms) are effective in the treatment of prostate fibrosis and alleviate associated urinary
dysfunction. Lastly, stratification of men with fibrotic prostates is imperative to increase BPH treatment efficacy.
To address this challenge, novel collagen MRI techniques will be used to assess whether prostatic fibrosis can
be identified in preclinical models. By establishing estrogen regulated cellular and molecular mechanistic
connections between fibrosis and BPH/LUTS we will discover a new etiology for BPH and effective treatments."
10813131,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive type of primary malignant brain tumor in
adults. GBM has a bleak prognosis of approximately 12-15 months, despite continuing
advances to the standard of care. Immunotherapy has demonstrated the significant
potential to boost immune responses against many cancer types; inhibitors of checkpoint
molecules, such as CTLA-4 and PD-1, have been used to treat many solid tumors with
varying success. While it has demonstrated efficacy in treating some tumors with an
inflammatory milieu and high degree of infiltration by anti-tumor T cells, it has shown little
to no response in treating tumors such as GBM. This tumor type is characterized by a
particularly immunosuppressive microenvironment with a notable paucity of T cells.
Targeted approaches designed to reduce immunosuppression in the tumor and increase
anti-tumor T cell activity are crucial to successfully treat GBM. Recent preclinical data from
our laboratory and preliminary findings from a Phase I clinical trial have shown promising
signs of efficacy with co-blockade of PD-1 and the alternative checkpoint LAG-3. We have
observed long-term survivors and radiographic responses in trial patients. We have noted
improved T cell responses against the tumor and a reduction in myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs), following dual therapy of patients. We propose to study the
mechanism by which the immune system is enhanced against GBM via PD-1/LAG-3
blockade. We hypothesize that dual therapy recruits cells of the myeloid compartment in
order to boost anti-cancer T cell activity, and reduces the presence of immunosuppressive
myeloid cells in the tumor itself. To test our hypothesis, we will investigate the: i) priming
of T cells by antigen presenting myeloid cells in response to dual therapy in murine models
of GBM, ii) role of soluble product generated from cleavage of surface LAG-3 molecule in
inducing myeloid-mediated immunosuppression in the tumor (using both murine models
and patient samples), and iii) expansion of anti-tumor T cells and reduction in MDSCs
levels in patients following dual therapy. We will correlate our findings with overall survival
and progression free survival of the trial patients. We expect that the data generated from
these studies will provide novel insights into a previously unexplored mechanism by which
dual immune checkpoint blockade therapy can modulate the myeloid response against
tumors. The knowledge obtained from this study will contribute to improving the design of
future therapeutic strategies to treat GBM patients."

Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) experience a high burden of symptoms including abdominal
pain, bloating, fatigue, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Yet, few self-management interventions
exist to reduce symptoms in this population. This proposed study will adapt an existing Comprehensive Self-
Management Intervention (CSM) with demonstrated efficacy in an irritable bowel syndrome population into a
population of individuals with IBD (CSM-IBD). The long-term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Kamp in
becoming an independent investigator with a program of research focused on improving self- and symptom-
management among individuals with IBD. As such, Dr. Kamp has training competencies to increase knowledge
and skills in advanced training in conducting randomized controlled trials, longitudinal data management,
processing and analysis of microbiome data and leading interdisciplinary teams. The Specific Aims are to: 1)
determine the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures (recruitment, randomization, data and sample
collection) and the CSM-IBD; 2) compare the CSM-IBD intervention to usual care on changes from baseline to
3 months post-intervention in quality of life and daily symptoms (fatigue, sleep disturbance, psychological
distress, and GI symptoms); and 3) explore the association of symptoms with socioecological factors (age, sex,
race/ethnicity, diet), clinical phenotype (medications, disease distribution), and biological signatures
(microbiome, calprotectin) with symptoms at baseline and response to intervention (immediately post-
intervention). The expected outcome will be preliminary feasibility data to inform a future R01 study which will
examine the efficacy of the CSM-IBD. To accomplish the research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary
mentorship team has been assembled with expertise in symptom science, IBD, psychology, interdisciplinary
research, RCTs, gut microbiome, statistics, and data management. The team, along with the vast array of
resources available at the University of Washington, are well-suited to transition Dr. Kamp into an independent
investigator. This research is significant because it will address an unmet need regarding self-management
among individuals with IBD and has the potential to not only significantly improve the quality of life but also
change the clinical management paradigm for individuals with IBD."
10813884,"ABSTRACT. Aim 1 of this project is built around years of collaborative work between Drs. Regnier and Murry
studying human stem cell derived cardiomyocytes as a potential cell replacement strategy for cardiac repair
following myocardial infarction (MI). We have shown that human stem cells can be differentiated into
cardiomyocytes (CMs), produced at a scale and purity that permit testing in rodent models and non-human
primates (NHP; Macaca nemestrina) and that these cells engraft and integrate with host tissue to improve left
ventricular performance. The premise for the proposed experiments is based on two fundamental discoveries:
1) 2-deoxy ATP (dATP) is a potent natural nucleotide stimulant of contractility when used by cardiac myosin, and
2) hiPSC-CMs that overexpress the rate-limiting enzyme for dATP synthesis, ribonucleotide reductase (RNR),
have increased contractility and also deliver dATP to the native myocardium heart via gap junctions. In our
current award we made excellent progress in testing the hypothesis that engineered hiPSC-CMs with elevated
RNR (hiPSC-CMRNR) improve outcomes in cell replacement therapy for MI (compared with control hiPSC-CMs).
For this proposal, we have generated new hiPSC-CM lines with gene-edited RNR and different transcriptional
promotors. These cells have greater RNR expression and produce multi-fold greater levels of cellular dATP.
Thus, we will test the dose dependence of elevated dATP for hiPSC-CMRNR engrafted into infarcted rat hearts.
The novel aspect of our approach is to go beyond replacement of lost tissue (with hiPSC-CMs) by using
engineered hiPSC-CMRNR to produce and deliver a small molecule therapeutic (dATP) that improves native heart
muscle contraction. This has the potential to substantially recover the post-MI depressed function of native
myocardium. Aim 2 will explore the mechanistic basis of how small increases in myocardial dATP result in
significant increases in contractile force and kinetics of activation and relaxation of muscle, and in the magnitude
of LV pressure development (LVDP) and kinetics of pressure development (+dP/dt) and decline (-dP/dt) of the
heart. Our recent reports and preliminary data strongly suggest at least three mechanisms are involved: 1)
disruption of the super-relaxed state (SRX) from the myosin backbone to a disordered relaxed state (DRX), 2)
movement of DRX myosin towards thin filaments via greater electrostatic interactions with actin, and 3) faster
crossbridge cycling. We have published multiple studies on the chemo-mechanics of faster crossbridge cycling
(3), so will focus primarily on mechanisms 1 and 2 here using multiple state of the art approaches. These include
low angle x-ray diffraction analysis of isolated myosin, cardiac muscle, and whole heart (Langendorff) levels,
stopped-flow ATPase, super-localization single molecule microscopy of thick filament zones, structure-based
computational models of myosin ± actin and multi-scale models of the heart. This project will elucidate the
potential of our combination cell-small molecule therapy approach to improve function in failing hearts and
provide understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms of the myosin activator dATP."
10813885,"PROJECT SUMMARY Stress is a major risk factor for the development of mood and anxiety disorders and the
causative agent in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Development of stress-related psychopathology is
variable among individuals and involves complex interactions between susceptibility mechanisms favoring
development of psychopathology and resiliency mechanisms protecting against the development of mental
illness in the face of adversity. Understanding the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms by which
stress exposure is translated into affective pathology could have broad implications for understanding the
pathophysiology of stress-related psychiatric disorders and for the development of novel treatment approaches.
We propose to test the overarching hypothesis that the endogenous cannabinoid 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)
is a critical regulator of stress adaptation and propose to elucidate the synaptic and cellular mechanisms by
which 2-AG signaling serves to mitigate pathological responses to stress exposure. We will first test the
hypothesis that 2-AG signaling inhibits bi-directional excitatory coupling between the amygdala and ventral
hippocampus, a neural circuit critical for mediating innate danger avoidance and generalization of learned fear
responses. We will test the hypothesis that stress causes a functional collapse of 2-AG signaling within this
circuit leading to synaptic strengthening, the generation of increased avoidance, and fear generalization. We will
also test the hypothesis that stress exposure leads to increases in 2-AG release within distinct amygdala circuits
in a neural activity-dependent manner using a novel virally encoded GPCR-based endocannabinoid biosensor.
These studies will reveal, for the first time, the temporal dynamics and activity-dependent mechanisms mediating
stress-induced endocannabinoid mobilization within amygdala circuits. Lastly, we will use in vivo single-cell
calcium imaging approaches to test the hypothesis that 2-AG is required for the dynamic changes in neuronal
ensemble representations to threat predictive cues that occur during fear learning, expression, generalization,
and extinction. Taken together, these data will provide new mechanistic insight into how 2-AG signaling regulates
stress-related biobehavioral processes relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders including PTSD and could reveal
novel pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to the translation of stress exposure into affective pathology."

There has been considerable progress in the last few years in the characterization of molecular alterations in
childhood cancer. Many defining genomic abnormalities as well as transcriptional and signaling networks
involved in specific sub-types of pediatric cancers have been identified. However, despite these impressive
advances, safe and effective therapies for most pediatric cancers are lacking. Leukemias are the leading cause
of cancer-linked mortality in children and for many pediatric leukemias, therapies that can selectively eliminate
cancer cells with few undesirable side effects have been elusive. Therefore, there is an urgent clinically unmet
need to develop non-toxic and targeted therapies for pediatric leukemia.
Our proposal is focused on leukemias with rearrangements of the AF10 gene. These rearrangements are
observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and other sub-types of
leukemia in children and adults. AF10-rearranged (AF10-R) leukemias can be considered prototypical models
of pediatric cancers in which chimeric fusion oncoproteins or altered transcription factors drive extensive self-
renewal and impaired differentiation of cancer cells. Our recent analysis of data from over 1,000 pediatric AML
patients demonstrates that AF10 gene fusions are much more common than generally appreciated (representing
6.5% of pediatric AML) and constitute one of the highest risk-groups in terms of resistance to primary therapies
and relapse rates. Our detailed mechanistic studies demonstrate that the AF10 fusion protein CALM-AF10
activates a number of pathways linked to stem cell self-renewal and inflammatory signaling, many of which are
independently associated with poor outcomes in AML. In this proposal, we will use a series of orthogonal
methodologies, including proteomic, genomic, epigenomic and detailed mechanistic studies in both human and
mouse AML models, to determine how the CALM-AF10 fusion protein causes leukemogenesis.
The successful execution of the proposed aims will advance our efforts towards finding newer targeted therapies
for AF10-R AML with fewer unwanted toxicities. Results from our studies also have the potential to significantly
influence treatment strategies in several other sub-types of pediatric leukemias driven by related mechanisms."
10814192,"Brown adipose tissue is composed of heterogenous adipocyte populations evidenced by the coexistence
of low-thermogenic adipocytes (mitochondria content low and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) low) and high-
thermogenic adipocytes within the tissue, a fundamental feature of adipocyte heterogeneity and plasticity.
However, the mechanisms underlying adipocyte heterogeneity and its significance in metabolic physiology and
disease remain poorly defined. In our preliminary study, we discovered a population of JunB-enriched
adipocytes (JunB+ adipocytes) within the brown fat depot that exhibits lower thermogenic capacity and less
lipid droplets compared to high-thermogenic adipocytes. The abundance of JunB+ adipocytes is increased
during obesity. Through snRNA-seq and functional assays, we observed that inactivation of JunB in adipocytes
increased the fraction of adipocytes exhibiting high mitochondrial content and thermogenic capacity.
Importantly, JunB ablation in UCP1+ adipocytes resulted in enhanced basal and cold-induced energy
expenditure and protected mice against diet-induced obesity. Based upon these novel findings, we
hypothesize that JunB serves a critical role in governing adipocyte heterogeneity and systemic energy
and glucose homeostasis. We will elucidate the mechanisms by which JunB suppresses high-thermogenic
cell differentiation and explore the regulation of JunB+ adipocyte development by examining the identity, origin,
and fate of this distinct subpopulation. We will also use Diphtheria toxin gene A chain (DTA)-
mediated approach to ablate JunB+ adipocytes within adipose tissue to determine the physiological role of this
subpopulation in regulating energy and glucose metabolism. Characterization of JunB in regulating adipocyte
heterogeneity and plasticity will provide novel knowledge to the biology of brown adipocyte and a solid
foundation to aid in the development of therapeutic interventions for obesity and its associated disorders."

Robustness is the ability of a system to maintain its functionality against internal or external perturbations and is
enabled by mechanisms of plasticity, a major feature of biological systems such as the immune system.
Autotherapies are approaches to optimize endogenous tissue responses to maintain health, treat diseases and
enhance tissue repair, in great part by restoring biological robustness. Interleukin (IL)-22 mediates unidirectional
communication from immune cells to tissue stromal cells and promotes homeostatic immunity, stem cell function
and tissue regeneration. However, IL-22 is associated with both detrimental and protective activities in chronic
inflammatory disorders, which has confounded its potential as a therapeutic target. The overall objective of this
proposal is to clearly define the functions of IL-22 in periodontal disease (PD) and attain a context-dependent
understanding of its protective or destructive potential, which will enable IL-22-targeted autotherapies to promote
immune robustness in the periodontium. The overall hypothesis is that IL-22 acts in a context-dependent manner
that influences the plasticity of the tissue from one tailored to perform immune surveillance or fight infections, to
one fitted for regeneration. Specifically, IL-22 is proposed to regulate periodontal tissue immune plasticity by (i)
preserving tissue integrity during steady-state (examined in Aim 1), contributing to vigorous immune responses
that become destructive during PD (Aim 2), and acting as an effector of bone regeneration in the resolution
phase (Aim 3). In Aim 1, in vivo intervention studies were designed to explore the requirement for IL-22 in
periodontal tissue homeostasis at steady state. Aim 2 examines, through both in vitro and in vivo mechanistic
experiments, the hypothesis that IL-22 synergizes with IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine that is upregulated in
PD, to promote destructive inflammation during the inductive phase of PD. Aim 3 explores the hypothesis that
IL-22 promotes inflammation clearance and bone regeneration during the resolution phase of PD, when the
expression of IL-17 massively declines. Regarding the mechanism by which IL-22 can promote osteogenesis, it
will be investigated whether IL-22 promotes the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem
cells. The proposed studies are expected to lead to a context-dependent understanding of the biological
functions of IL-22 in PD, leading to novel IL-22-targeted autotherapies to appropriately modulate immune
plasticity and restore homeostasis in the periodontium, thereby benefiting PD patients."

10814344,"Abstract: As of August 4, 2021, COVID-19 has infected 35,286,935 people in the US with a mortality rate of
1.73%. One common COVID-19 induced complication is acute cardiac injury manifested by impaired cardiac
function. These injuries have been associated with poor prognosis and increased mortality for COVID-19 patients.
While acute cardiac injury is a major contributor to COVID-19 mortality, the underlying causes have not been
elucidated. Among multiple factors (e.g., direct viral infection) that can contribute to COVID-19 induced
cardiomyopathies, recent clinical data indicates that cytokine storm is a major contributor. COVID-19 infection
initiates supraphysiological activation of the immune system, which leads to the release of inflammatory
cytokines (e.g., IL-1E, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, TNFD, G-CSF and MIP1D) into circulation, resulting in organ toxicity such
as vascular instability and adverse cardiac events. Despite the critical roles of COVID-19 cytokine storm in acute
cardiac injury, the current lack of animal and in vitro models has limited the mechanistic understanding and
drug development. Further, while recent clinical data suggests that COVID-19 survivors with acute cardiac
injuries can experience long-term cardiac abnormalities, outcome studies may take years to complete due to the
novelty of this coronavirus. This highlights an unmet need to develop an effective model that can predict long-
term cardiac outcomes of convalescent COVID-19 patients to provide guidance for clinical monitoring and
therapeutic interventions. Our organoids provide a powerful platform to address this. The organoids are
composed of hiPSC derived cardiomyocytes, human cardiac fibroblasts, human endothelial cells, and vascular
supporting cells. The goal of this proposal is to develop an in vitro model for COVID-19 cytokine storm induced
acute cardiac injuries by leveraging the innate inflammatory properties of cells (e.g., fibroblasts, endothelial cells)
in the organoids, as these cells have been shown to produce various proinflammatory cytokines under
stimulation. IL-1E is one of the first cytokines released from monocytes in response to viral infection and is known
to induce IL-6 production, the central player in cytokine storm. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
IL-1E will induce cytokine storm in the organoids and recapitulate the COVID-19 induced acute cardiac injuries.
This proposal is innovative in that we will harness a viral infection induced upstream cytokine stimulus (IL-1E)
to initiate an endogenous inflammatory response to simulate cytokine storm in the organoids. Accordingly, we
will pursue the two aims: 1) Use IL-1E treated cardiac organoids to model COVID-19 cytokine storm induced
cardiac injuries, determine the underlying mechanisms, and test the effects of immunomodulatory drugs, and 2)
Use human cardiac organoids to assess the long-term cardiac complications of COVID-19 cytokine storm. The
proposed research will establish an in vitro model system to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of COVID-
19 cytokine storm induced cardiac injuries, demonstrate its validity for drug testing, and provide insights on the
long-term cardiac effects of COVID-19 infection to guide clinical monitoring and therapeutic interventions."
10814376,"Project Summary
Pathogenic bacteria employ specialized secretion systems to identify and interact with host cells and to
exchange genetic information through horizontal gene transfer. These machines are attractive drug targets
because they are surface-exposed, widely conserved, and specific for pathogenicity. Unfortunately, however,
the structures of many of these critical systems remain poorly understood. Here we describe how we will
continue to use electron cryotomography (cryoET) to dissect the structures and functions of pathogenic
nanomachines. CryoET is a revolutionary imaging technique with the power to reveal native structures inside
intact cells in 3D with macromolecular (2-5 nm) resolution. Subtomogram averaging of identical structures from
one or more cryotomograms can push this resolution to better than 1 nm in the most favorable cases, enabling
components to be placed in their context in the complete machine. My group has pioneered the development
of this revolutionary imaging technology, and in just under four years of our first award period, we have used
cryoET to produce tens of new structures of pathogenic secretion systems and build architectural models of
key systems belonging to the type IV pilus (T4P), type VI secretion system (T6SS) and type IV secretion
system (T4SS) families, producing a flood of new mechanistic insights. By exploiting new cryoET technologies
we have just developed in the past couple years, here we propose to extend our work in the next award period
to different functional states of these complexes, key related systems, and a new target: the pathogenic type IX
secretion system (T9SS). In addition, we will push the whole body of work to higher resolution. For each target,
we will image the entire, intact structure in situ. In most cases, this will be the first high-resolution imaging of
these structures. We will then combine subtomogram averaging with difference analysis of mutants in which
individual components are knocked out or tagged with additional density in order to produce architectural
models of the complexes. In cases where atomic models of components (or homologs) are available, we will
dock them into our maps to produce pseudo-atomic models of each machine. By comparing these structures
with those of non-pathogenic relatives (solved previously or in the proposed work), we aim to identify
adaptations underlying virulence functions. We will also apply state-of-the-art cryogenic correlated light and
electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM) to guide cryogenic focused ion beam (FIB) milling to enable us to image
pathogenic secretion systems in action: in bacterial cells infecting eukaryotic hosts. This will provide the first
such images of critical human pathogens, which we expect to provide invaluable insights into the operation of
their virulence machinery in vivo. Together, we expect this project to produce a detailed mechanistic picture of
the T4SS, T4P, and T9SS nanomachines that mediate pathogenesis, an important first step in identifying
therapeutic targets in the future."

our CTSA Hub. These efforts increase the capacity for communication between researchers and
stakeholders, allowing us to advance the science of community-engaged translational research and build upon
our programs in multidisciplinary team-based science. Since 2008, we have focused on advancing team
science by developing, testing, and implementing leadership training for scientific teams, and by supporting
Multidisciplinary Translational Teams (MTTs) which bring together investigators from diverse disciplines who
are working along the translational spectrum to address priority health issues. Our broad-based
stakeholders include our leadership, investigators, patients, clinicians, advocacy groups, community
members and organizations, sister CTSA hubs, consumers of translational research and health information,
commercial interests, and policymakers. Our long-term objective is to integrate community engagement and
team-based science across the spectrum of translational science—in leadership and governance,
communications, implementation, research, and dissemination. Engaging patients and communities
throughout the translational research lifecycle and process enables us to ensure successful outcomes
through patient-focused research design, implementation, and dissemination. In past years, our programming
has focused on the Houston-Galveston metroplex and, in conjunction with the Texas Regional CTSA
Consortium, the other major cities in the state of Texas, i.e., San Antonio, Dallas, and Austin. In the coming

10818233,"Project Summary
Microbial adaptation within different natural environments is a poorly understood area of emerging infectious
disease research and is relevant toward improving public health. For example, tick-borne relapsing fever (RF)
spirochetes are a significant yet understudied public health problem. The pathogens colonize insect and tick
vectors including Ornithodoros species. These ticks are long lived (10 – 20 years), possess multiple nymphal
stages, and maintain RF spirochetes transstadially and transovarially. Within the Ornithodoros species, RF
spirochetes persistently colonize the immunological and physiological disparate environments of the midgut and
salivary glands. An important aspect of vector competence for RF spirochetes is vector specificity. Here, a given
RF spirochete species has evolved to colonize a specific species of Ornithodoros tick. For example, nonnative
species (i.e. Borrelia hermsii) can infect Ornithodoros turicata, are detected post-molt in the midgut, are initially
detected in the salivary glands within 7 to 10 days post-acquisition, but cannot persistently colonize the salivary
gland acini post molt. This contrasts the native species (Borrelia turicatae) that persistently colonizes the salivary
glands for over five years. These findings and the vague understanding of argasid immunity indicates the need
of functional genomics approaches to delineate the mechanisms of vector colonization by RF spirochetes.
Recently, four putative antimicrobial peptides in the defensin family were identified. Designated OtdA-OtdD, they
have structural features common of defensins. Moreover, they are differentially expressed during the life cycle
of uninfected O. turicata, and preliminary data show that otdA and otdC remain up-regulated in infected tick
midguts. This further indicates a role of these peptides in immunity. Consequently, in this application a
comprehensive (Aim 1) and focused (Aim 2) approach will be implemented to understand argasid immunity.
The overall hypothesis is that B. turicatae has uniquely adapted to O. turicata immunity and are resistant to
defensin mediated killing. This hypothesis will be tested with two aims. The first aim will exploit the inability of B.
hermsii to persistently colonize the salivary glands of O. turicata. The hypothesis is that transcriptional responses
of immune related genes are consistent in O. turicata regardless of if the tick is infected with native (B. turicatae)
versus nonnative (B. hermsii) spirochetes. This comparative transcriptional analysis will indicate whether B.
turicatae has uniquely adapted to the natural immunological responses of the tick and/or if the species modulates
host gene expression to generate an environment suitable for colonization. The second aim will evaluate the role
of OtdA-OtdD in immunity. The hypothesis is that B. turicatae resists OtdA–OtdD killing while these small proteins
are borreliacidal to other species of RF spirochetes. The completion of this aim will determine whether O. turicata
OtdA–OtdD are novel tick antimicrobial peptides that are borreliacidal against nonnative species of RF
spirochete. Understanding the molecular events occurring in the tick will guide novel control strategies."
10820482,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 The number of vector-borne disease cases in the US has tripled over the past decade and these
pathogens including mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) remain an apparent threat to general public health. The
ZIKV outbreaks in the Americas and Southeast Asia is a major global health concern, largely due to the
association with fetal craniofacial abnormalities and malformations, resulting from prenatal infection. Although
ZIKV infection during pregnancy is casually associated with microcephaly, it is important to note that intracranial
calcification is the most frequent abnormality present in ZIKV-positive babies. In fact, Magnetic Resonance
Imaging study of Brazilian large ZIKV-positive baby cohort reported the intracranial calcifications as the most
common clinical observations. While calcification occurs in soft tissues, the abnormal deposition of calcium in
brain not only severely affects motor function, speech ability, and vision, but also causes seizures. Despite the
growing clinical evidences of ZIKV-induced calcifications and their potential dire outcomes, however, the etiology
and molecular mechanisms of ZIKV-induced brain calcification remain elusive. My preliminary observations in
ZIKV human fetal brain specimens showed that high level of calcium deposits was localized with virus-infected
perivascular cells. Intriguingly, ZIKV-infection of brain perivascular and osteogenic precursor cells robustly
induced calcifications in vitro. Surprisingly, the induction of calcification was lineage-specific to the Asian ZIKV
strains, but not to the African ZIKV strains. African ZIKV strains rapidly replicated, inducing cell death, while Asian
ZIKV strains persistently replicated, leading to aberrant calcium deposition. Surprisingly, ZIKV expression library
screen showed that NS3 protease was sufficient to induce calcification. Based on these preliminary data, I
hypothesize that ZIKV targets specific host brain perivascular cells and utilizes NS3 protease to induce
intracranial calcifications, which ultimately contributes to virus-associated congenital abnormality.
Herein, I seek to address the following questions: (i) which host cells are targeted for ZIKV-induced calcifications,
and (ii and iii) which and how ZIKV NS3 protease triggers abnormal calcification during infection. This proposal
is highly innovative and translational, and potentially shed new insights to ZIKV-induced intracranial calcification
that is the most frequent abnormality present in virus-infected babies."

 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This renewal proposal responds to PAR 19-258 and describes an addiction research training program
designed to increase the number of interdisciplinary scientists interested in and capable of serving as
Principal Investigators (PIs) on extramurally funded research from underrepresented racial/ethnic minority
(URM) groups. Significant disparities in the number of URM scientists successfully receiving awards for
independent funding (i.e., NIH, NSF, etc.) continue to plague scientific research despite many years of efforts
to improve such disparities. Moreover, the expansion of the field of translational neuroscience further highlights
disparities in the numbers of qualified URM scientists trained with knowledge of basic science as it relates to
“real world” addiction treatment needs in the community.
This renewal proposal focuses on addressing these gaps through the continuation of an innovative research
training and mentoring program – Translational Research Training in Addictions for Racial/Ethnic
minorities at CCNY and Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC), or TRACC Program – that reaches
earlier into the career development pipeline to identify talented undergraduate medical school (BS/MD), MA-
and PhD- level URM students from diverse disciplines at urban, public minority serving institutions: City
College of New York (CCNY) and, an expansion site for this proposal, Rutgers, the State University of New
Jersey (RU). These young scholars will be provided intensive training and support that will facilitate their
developmental trajectory as translational substance use disorder (SUD) researchers. RU not only expands the
reach of this successful program, but broadens access to scientific and methodological expertise of mentors.
The TRACC-RU Program is supported by the mentorship of committed leaders in the addiction research field
at CCNY and RU in partnership with faculty from the Division on Substance Use Disorders at CUMC to
promote applied research training in two critically related ways. Our trainees are exposed to: (1) cutting edge
science and methodologies in animal and human models of addiction through our psychiatry, psychology, and
cognitive neuroscience research programs and related lab experiences and; (2) critical issues in conducting
community-based clinical treatment trials, grounded in our expertise of effectiveness and implementation trials
of evidence-based addiction treatments in the community. Overarching outcomes for TRACC trainees include:
1) obtaining knowledge about key neuroscience research (questions and approaches) in the context of
community treatment in drug abuse; 2) conducting a substance abuse-related research project; 3) presenting a
paper or poster at a local or national conference; 4) authoring or co-authoring a scientific journal article; 5)
preparing an application for a training grant award to an APA or NIH mechanism funding program and; 6)
developing research self-efficacy.

10817733,"ABSTRACT
Classic neurocognitive models of cortico-basal ganglia circuits imply excitatory signals drive, and inhibitory
signals suppress, behavioral output. However, inhibition can support other computations. Important research on
animal motor systems and human sensory systems has shown inhibition shapes the gain and tuning properties
of neural populations. Compelling evidence suggests these same two computations support action preparation
in the human motor system. The overall objectives of this application are to establish roles for gain modulation
and tuning within the human motor system during action preparation and to evaluate to what extent these
computations relate to the neurochemical capacity for inhibition. The long-term goals of this work are to

control and to understand how disease-related disruption of these mechanisms contributes to behavioral
impairments. Accordingly, the proposed experiments will test the central hypothesis that gain and tuning within
the human corticospinal pathway change dynamically during the preparation of actions and relate to inhibitory
neurotransmitter availability in motor cortex. The first specific aim of this application is to test the hypothesis that
gain within the human motor system increases during action preparation to facilitate the execution of a selected
action. The second specific aim is to test the hypothesis that spatial tuning of motor representations sharpens
during action preparation. Sharper tuning of motor representations is expected to promote more fine-grained
control by facilitating the selective recruitment of muscles involved in a prepared action. Whereas Aim 1
examines a computational mechanism for facilitating the execution of a selected action, Aim 2 examines a
computational mechanism for selecting actions from a pool of neighboring and overlapping representations. We
will use non-invasive brain stimulation to examine the patterns of excitability within a given muscle (Aim 1) and
across a group of muscles (Aim 2) to detect changes in gain and tuning, respectively, during behavioral task
performance. The third specific aim of this application is to explore relationships between gain, tuning, and local
availability of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) in the cortex. Individual
differences will be examined to test whether the availability of local GABA correlates with the magnitude of gain
and tuning changes. We hypothesize individuals with more GABA in motor cortex will exhibit greater increases
in gain and sharper tuning during action preparation. The proposed work is innovative because the roles of gain
and tuning within the human motor system are crucially understudied and their links to neurochemical content
are completely unexplored. This research is significant because the results could change our interpretation of
the roles of inhibition in behavioral control. Abnormalities in inhibitory mechanisms are associated with symptoms
of Parkinson’s disease, stroke, and dystonia, and knowledge gained from the proposed experiments can help
identify new targets for therapeutic interventions."
10991762,"ABSTRACT
Classic neurocognitive models of cortico-basal ganglia circuits imply excitatory signals drive, and inhibitory
signals suppress, behavioral output. However, inhibition can support other computations. Important research on
animal motor systems and human sensory systems has shown inhibition shapes the gain and tuning properties
of neural populations. Compelling evidence suggests these same two computations support action preparation
in the human motor system. The overall objectives of this application are to establish roles for gain modulation
and tuning within the human motor system during action preparation and to evaluate to what extent these
computations relate to the neurochemical capacity for inhibition. The long-term goals of this work are to
characterize physiological and neurochemical contributions to the neural computations underlying human action
control and to understand how disease-related disruption of these mechanisms contributes to behavioral
impairments. Accordingly, the proposed experiments will test the central hypothesis that gain and tuning within

Stroke is the leading cause of motor disability in the United States, with approximately 700,000 new cases per
year. Impaired hand and finger control are a leading cause of such disability. Despite advances in task-
specific training for the upper limb, a large number of stroke patients do not regain full function of their hand;
novel treatment methods are urgently required. We propose to use a systems neuroscience and `neural
engineering' framework that captures the dynamic interactions between neurons and the distributed motor
network to both characterize and develop novel neurophysiological based neuromodulation approaches to
enhance motor function. Studies in healthy animals support a framework for dynamic interactions between
local and distant areas through transient oscillations. Oscillations are defined by a frequency bandwidth, e.g.
motor areas are known to have task-related low-frequency oscillations (0.5-4 Hz). How the recovery process
affects neural activity and oscillatory dynamics in primates preforming dexterous tasks remains unknown?
Our recent studies in rats (Ramanathan et al., Nature Medicine 2018; Lemke et al., Nature Neuroscience,
2019) demonstrated that population dynamics linked to low-frequency oscillatory activity (0.5-4Hz “LFO”) are
essential for movement control, track spontaneous recovery and can serve as a target for modulation using
electrical stimulation. More specifically, cortical stimulation was found to both boost LFO power and augment
motor function. Essential translational steps involve testing whether this approach also works for gyrated
brains during the performance of dexterous tasks.
This proposal aims to use in vivo electrophysiological methods to model the network dynamics of recovery.
The underlying hypothesis is that synchronous LFO spike-field interactions in the perilesional cortex are
important for recovery and its modulation can augment dexterous motor function. Importantly, our preliminary
data provides strong support for our proposed research goals; we have found that low-frequency oscillatory
dynamics drive coordination of sensory and motor areas during recovery and that artificial low-frequency
electrical stimulation can boost dexterous function during recovery.
Completion of these aims will provide critical information for designing therapeutic approaches that specifically
target perilesional oscillatory activity with low frequency electrical stimulation. Focusing on targeted
neuromodulation of such dynamic network interactions represents a new direction that could transform our
ability to augment upper extremity function following stroke."

In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse
sample of 11,878 9- to 10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2,136 are twins or triplets. Expert
workgroups (WGs) designed protocols using proven methods to assess, scan, and maintain this cohort with very
high retention rates. The study complements well validated standardized assessments with novel real-time
objective data collected wirelessly in the natural environment to securely capture indices of youth behaviors.
These technologies add measurement precision, ecological validity, and an opportunity to reveal previously
unknown effects of behavioral, physiological, and environmental factors in the development and fluctuation of
substance use, screen media use, mental and physical health concerns, brain development, and their dynamic
relationships. Bioassays (e.g., from hair, shed teeth, blood, and oral fluid) provide genome-wide genotyping,
pubertal hormones, more precise estimates of exposures to substances of abuse and environmental toxins, and
eventually more comprehensive estimates of relevant epigenetic effects. State-of-the-art harmonization methods
for MRI and other data enable seamless data integration across sites into an invaluable open-science database
that becomes available to the larger scientific community within a year of data collection. The Coordinating
Center (CC) met all of its previous aims, and here describes how it will achieve an adjusted set of aims for the
next 7 years. Specifically, we describe a flexible organizational framework created for management of the study
that relies heavily on cross-disciplinary knowledge and extensive research experience of expert assessment
WGs and strategic planning groups, and a dedicated team within the CC, Data Analysis, Informatics and
Resource Center (DAIRC), and NIH to coordinate internal and external communications; support and integrate
the development and revision of protocols and data quality reviews performed by WGs; establish, monitor, and
maintain the standardization of study protocols across the consortium sites; measure and review study progress
toward goals for retention, data quality, and scientific impact; based on these metrics, take supportive and
corrective action to ensure that the goals are met; manage bioethics policies and consortium interactions with
the single IRB (sIRB); promote the professional development of diverse junior investigators; establish a
framework to resolve conflicts within the CC or within the wider consortium; and responsibly address any
unanticipated scientific, methodological, logistical, or ethical challenges to ensure the study achieves its
overarching objectives. We also describe how the CC and DAIRC will together implement quality control
procedures to improve data quality across all data types; coordinate data sharing functions with the staff of the
NIMH Data Archive; manage a pipeline for enhancing the study with novel assessment technologies; and
facilitate rigorous analyses of ABCD data that set new standards for use of data from this powerful, but complex
and challenging, high-dimensional study."
10817895,"Summary
Mycolic acids are essential building blocks of the outer membrane of all mycobacteria and the interest in drugs
targeting their biosynthesis and export is clearly illustrated by the therapeutic efficacy of several past and
present anti-mycobacterial agents including isoniazid, ethionamide, thiacetazone and isoxyl, and a number of
recently discovered small molecule inhibitors reported to inhibit the integral membrane mycolic acid
transporter, MmpL3. Joint efforts by our Consortium prior to and during the previous funding period have led to
the discovery of MmpL3 and to the validation of this transporter as a target of therapeutic interest. These
studies further allowed us to gain the first insights into its structure, energetics and mechanisms of
susceptibility and resistance to inhibitors.
Despite these advances, important gaps still remain in our understanding of the translocation of mycolic acids
from the cytoplasm to the periplasm and outer membrane, the precise role played by MmpL3 in this process,
and the molecular mechanisms involved. Several lines of evidence indicate that the export of mycolic acids to
the cell surface involves more components than the only MmpL3 protein, and that MmpL3 may act as a
scaffold for a multiprotein complex coupling synthesis and export. Our preliminary evidence further indicates
that MmpL3 may play a role in coordinating, at the level of the plasma membrane, the focal deposition of cell
wall core constituents during cell elongation and cell division.
Aim 1 of this basic research proposal is to define the nature of the MmpL3-associated machinery responsible
for the efficient synthesis and export of mycolic acids in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and to probe the
involvement of MmpL3 in the spatiotemporal coordination of new cell wall deposition during cell elongation and
division. Under Aim 2, a detailed biochemical examination of MmpL3 will be conducted to delineate the precise
extent of mycolic acid transport mediated by MmpL3 in mycobacterial cells and to gain insight in the molecular
mechanisms involved. The assays developed under this aim will further be used to probe the precise
mechanism of action of MmpL3 inhibitors and associated mechanisms of resistance.
In addition to providing fundamental knowledge about essential physiological processes of all mycobacteria,
the results from these studies will facilitate current drug development efforts targeted to MmpL3 and could
further lead to innovative therapeutic strategies targeting key metabolic processes at the intersection of cell
envelope biosynthesis and cell elongation and division."
10817896,"Background: Lung cancers are often driven by mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (mtEGFR). While
EGFR tyrosine kinase activity inhibitors (TKI) have shown effectiveness, within 9-13 months all patients
develop resistance including to 3rd generation TKI - Osimertinib. These patients do not have any approved
therapy options, therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel agent that functions independently of
kinase function. DGD1202, a first-in-class, novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule that inhibits EGFR
dimerization, induces degradation of EGFR and selectively kills TKI resistant NSCLC tumors.
Objective: We and others have shown that the degradation of mutant EGFR protein has a profound effect on
cancer cell survival. Thus, we hypothesized that a drug which induces degradation of mtEGFR independent of
the ATP binding domain will result in selective activity. Our objective is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of
DGD1202 in a panel of lung cancer cells lines, xenografts, and PDXs derived from lung cancer patients
containing mtEGFR who have undergone treatment with a TKI.
Specific Aims: We propose to evaluate the specificity and potency of DGD1202 against TKI-resistant lung
cancer cells and xenografts. Aim 1 is to determine the in vitro efficacy of DGD1202 against a panel of EGFR
driven, including osimertinib-resistant, cancer cell lines relative to normal cells. Aim 2 is to conduct in vivo
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses to assess drug exposure and determine the effect
on the target. Aim 3 is to determine the overall therapeutic efficacy and long-term safety of DGD1202 in vivo.
We hypothesize that treatment with DGD1202 will induce EGFR degradation preferentially in tumor cells driven
by mtEGFR and that EGFR degradation will correlate with the overall response.
Study Design: We will screen DGD1202 alongside osimertinib in a series of lung cancer lines. The resulting
response will be then correlated with effect on EGFR degradation. We also propose to determine in vivo PK
and PD studies both with a single and with fractionated dosing to determine the optimum bioavailability. Using
the optimized dose and schedule, we will assess effects on EGFR protein against a panel mtEGFR-driven and
osimertinib resistant lung cancer xenograft and PDX models. The long-term safety will be assessed in immune
competent mice. Standard statistical models will be used to compare the response to treatment and how it
correlates with effects on EGFR.
Impact: We anticipate that our approach will open a new way to target EGFR and, more broadly, to develop
therapeutics to selectively target mutated proteins to degradation. The knowledge gained from in vivo tumor
models will provide a rationale for the use of this class of molecules in future clinical studies."

GERD affects roughly 20% of the U.S. population and the direct and indirect costs of GERD are substantial,
totaling close to 50 billion dollars per year. Evidence supports that a large proportion of this cost and poor
clinical outcomes in GERD are related to poor healthcare decisions by both the physician and the patient. The
problem of inappropriate GERD management stems from three main issues. First, the disease is heterogeneous
and requires treatment informed by a precision model. Second, the current paradigm largely ignores the
important brain-gut interactions that drive symptoms and healthcare utilization. Third, there is a paucity of well-
performed comparative effectiveness trials focused on assessing treatments beyond acid suppression. The
overarching goal of this project over the first two funding cycles primarily focused on the first two problems and
we have made major progress developing new physiological predictors of outcome and a more efficient process
of phenotyping patients. During the first two cycles, we also determined that psychological distress, in the form
of hypervigilance and autonomic arousal, is a major component of patient outcome in GERD. We were able to
refute dogma suggesting that there is an inverse relationship between psychological distress and organic
disease. Instead, our data proved that hypervigilance was as important as the physiologic perturbations in
determining symptom severity and quality of life and these factors were important across the entire spectrum of
disease presentation. This work led to the creation of the Psycho-Physiologic Model of GERD that focuses on
targeting the primary physiologic abnormality and the important brain-gut interactions driving disease severity.
 The current competitive renewal will focus on the third problem by performing much needed randomized
controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of behavioral interventions in patients with functional heartburn and
refractory GERD. We will use physiomarkers defined during the previous funding cycle to phenotype the patients
and use cognitive behavioral interventions to modulate hypervigilance to test the Psycho-Physiologic Model of
GERD. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is able to improve hypervigilance and symptom specific autonomic
arousal and thus, we will test our theory that CBT can improve outcomes in GERD by targeting these two
important psychologic stressors. We will also continue our focus on the interplay of psychology and physiology
by determining whether increased mucosal permeability is associated with reflux perception and whether this is
modified by hypervigilance and autonomic disruption. This proposal will have a dramatic impact on the field as
it will provide important clinical data to guide behavioral treatments in gastroenterology and further define how
brain-gut interactions influence symptoms and quality of life in GERD."
10817671,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Spontaneous labor in pregnant women is more often initiated at night when melatonin levels are normally
high. Melatonin administration in vitro increases uterine contractility, but whether exogenous melatonin can
increase uterine contractions in humans is unknown. Whether melatonin administration can increase uterine
contractions in the presence of light exposure at night, which suppresses melatonin levels, is also not known.
Light exposure at night is common both at home and in hospitalized settings, and the suppressed melatonin
levels may be associated with lower uterine contractions. Therefore, we propose to test the causal relationship
between circulating melatonin concentrations and uterine contractions during the day and during the evening.
This basic physiological information is needed before obstetric interventions using melatonin can be designed.
 In our recent studies in 28 late-term pregnant women, we induced significant (40%) melatonin suppression
using monochromatic short-wavelength (blue/green) light exposure at night. In the control condition, the women
were exposed to long-wavelength (red) light, which did not suppress melatonin levels. The two light exposure
conditions created a range of circulating melatonin levels in which we found a significant positive relationship
between circulating melatonin concentration and the number of objectively measured uterine contractions.
Therefore, we propose to test 3 hypotheses in controlled inpatient hospital conditions by measuring uterine
contractions in full-term pregnant women after exogenous melatonin: (i) exogenous melatonin during the day
when endogenous melatonin levels are almost undetectable will increase uterine contractions, (ii) exogenous
melatonin administration at night during light exposure-induced suppression of normally high concentrations of
endogenous melatonin will increase uterine contractions; (iii) there is a positive correlation between circulating
melatonin levels and number of uterine contractions. The first experiment is a randomized double-blind trial in
which participants will receive a 0.0 mg (placebo), 0.5 mg (physiological), or a 3.0 mg (supraphysiological) dose
of melatonin in the morning (~4 h after wake). The second experiment is a randomized double-blind trial in which
participants will be exposed to monochromatic long-wavelength and a placebo pill during the evening on Night1
and then short-wavelength light with placebo or 0.5 mg dose of melatonin during the evening on Night2. In both
experiments, participants will be ≥40 weeks pregnant women and uterine contractions will be monitored
continuously using tocometry. Data from both experiments will be used for testing the correlation hypothesis.
 Better understanding of the physiological role of melatonin in modulating uterine contractions is important for
designing interventions that can improve obstetric care. Ramifications of these physiological findings for the
practice of obstetrics could be dramatic, including the use of pharmaceutical-grade melatonin, its antagonists, or
light exposure that alters endogenous melatonin levels to modulate contractions. These low cost and low risk
interventions could also eventually be used in facilities with limited resources to improve labor and delivery."

Staphylococcus aureus infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and across
the globe. This is largely due to the evolution of multidrug-resistance and the ability of the bacterium to adapt
its metabolism and bioenergetics to infect nearly every site of the human body. Thus, there is a significant
need for the development of effective therapeutics against this organism. There are several critical gaps in our
knowledge of how metabolic pathways used by S. aureus in different environments influence this pathogen
virulence in vitro and inside the host. Therefore, our long-term goal is to elucidate how S. aureus receives
signals from the environment in the host (e.g. oxygen concentration, nutrients), senses its own redox poise and
energy status, and triggers metabolic changes, including the production of virulence factors.
 Our previous studies identified two respiratory enzymes in S. aureus called type 2 NADH dehydrogenases
(NDH-2s: NdhC and NdhF) and revealed their importance for animal infection and organ colonization, and the
production of virulence factors and biofilm formation in vitro. These results lead to our central hypothesis that
the NADH-dependent respiratory chain is primarily responsible for controlling the NADH/NAD+ and MQH2/MQ
(menaquinol/menaquinone) pools that are used by the cell to monitor its redox status and which we propose
are major elements regulating virulence via specific global regulators. Guided by strong preliminary data, we
propose to pursue three Specific Aims: (1) Determine the metabolic pathways utilized both in the presence
and absence of each of the two NADH dehydrogenase enzymes, and the molecular mechanisms by which
these enzymes modulate the production of α-toxin; (2) Determine why the presence of both NADH
dehydrogenase enzymes is important for biofilm formation; (3) Determine if menaquinol is the signaling
molecule that directly induces SrrB and SaeS autokinase activity in the SaeRS and SrrAB two-component
systems, which are both critical for the regulation of virulence and biofilm formation. To accomplish these Aims,
we have assembled a powerful team to employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines metabolomics,
proteomics, genetics, microfluidics technology and biochemistry.
 Collectively, our proposed studies will have a broad impact on the field by uncovering the role of the
respiratory chain in connecting environment signals with the intracellular redox poise that regulates S. aureus
virulence. In the long term, these studies may reveal novel therapeutic targets to treat S. aureus-related
diseases."
10823232,"Glia are non-neuronal cells with diverse functions that range from forming the myelin sheath to defending the
brain against infection. A major goal of our research is to use the powerful experimental advantages of
zebrafish to discover new genes that are essential for the development and function of two classes of glia in
the CNS, oligodendrocytes and microglia.
Oligodendrocytes form myelin on axons in the CNS. After an oligodendrocyte begins to myelinate axons, it has
only a short developmental window (or “critical period”) to extend new myelinating processes. Using genetic
and cellular approaches in zebrafish, we have identified a number of positive and negative regulators of
myelination. One of our goals is to determine how these factors control myelination during development,
neural plasticity, and remyelination. In addition, we will investigate the molecular basis of the critical period.
Microglia are highly motile, phagocytic glial cells in the CNS that destroy pathogens and clear debris such as
apoptotic cells and damaged axons. Despite the importance of microglia in CNS health and disease, many
critical questions remain to be addressed about these cells. We have conducted zebrafish mutational screens
to discover essential microglial genes, and we are characterizing their functions using in vivo imaging and
other approaches.
The mechanistic insight gained from these studies will advance our fundamental understanding of the central
nervous system, illuminate the pathways that are disrupted in diseases of the brain, and suggest avenues
toward therapies for neurological disorders."

Yearly influenza epidemics strike millions of people, causing up to 500,000 deaths. Fatality caused by most
seasonal influenza viruses is <0.03%, but with significant mortality in the young and the elderly populations.
When a new pathogenic influenza strain enters the population, a pandemic could kill tens of millions of people
with a negative economic impact estimated to be over 150 billion dollars. Due to the incomplete efficacy of the
current vaccines, effective drug treatment is necessary. Presently, influenza treatment is only somewhat
effective, and some influenza strains are resistant to the currently marketed therapeutics, adamantanes and the
neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu®. However, while zanamivir (ZAN, Relenza®) remains highly active against
oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains, its therapeutic impact is severely limited by its route of administration, via
oral inhalation, which renders it unsuitable for patients with a compromised respiratory system. Therefore,
development of a novel delivery alternative for ZAN as we propose here, is poised to address a significant unmet
medical need.
Transdermal drug delivery offers a number of improvements over other delivery systems. The drug directly enters
the systemic circulation, circumventing absorption and first-pass barriers typical for oral delivery. It avoids skin
puncture by syringe needles, eliminating pain and patient visits to a clinician. Transdermal delivery of ZAN could
allow large numbers of patients to be reached during an influenza outbreak, which will be particularly important
in light of the added risk during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While ZAN itself cannot cross the human skin
barrier at therapeutic rates, Microneedle (MN) - enhanced transdermal delivery is an elegant, efficient, and
painless method for increasing the skin permeation of many drugs, including ZAN. Our novel drug-device
combination product, TSR-066, consists of a swellable MN patch, which will continuously deliver ZAN over 5
days. This CRP proposal will support optimization and scale-up of the ZAN MN formulation and subsequent IND-
enabling toxicology studies in minipigs. We have obtained agreement with the FDA on the preclinical studies
needed in order to open the IND, as well as on the Phase I clinical development plans and the 505(b)2 regulatory
strategy. In addition to the experimental work proposed here, we will develop a robust IP expansion strategy for
the current ZAN MN product, as well as future product candidates that stand to benefit from MN-enabled delivery.
The end result of this work will be a novel, transdermal delivery approach for ZAN, which will expand its reach
into patient groups for which Relenza® is contraindicated and allow for simple administration for ZAN for both
treatment and prevention of the flu. We have assembled a team of expert advisors and collaborators to ensure
successful completion of this research plan."

This award will support a prospective clinical study and the career development of Loren E. Smith, MD, PhD. Dr.
Smith completed a PhD in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) molecular biology with Dr. Sean Davidson at the
University of Cincinnati and residency training in Anesthesiology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
(VUMC), where she was appointed faculty in 2017. VUMC is a tertiary academic hospital renowned for its highly
collaborative research environment, exceptional career development programs, and extensive core facilities.
During her T32 fellowship Dr. Smith and her mentors, Drs. Linton, Billings, and Vickers, discovered an
association between higher preoperative HDL and reduced AKI in cardiac surgery patients. In her proposed
study, Dr. Smith will test the hypotheses that higher perioperative concentrations of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I and
specific HDL-microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with less postoperative AKI (Aim 1), that a higher HDL
functional capacity to suppress endothelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and renal proximal
tubule cell toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 expression is associated with less AKI (Aim 2), and that exogenous
HDL administration to mice before renal ischemia and reperfusion (IR) reduces renal ICAM-1, TLR2, and TLR4
expression and AKI (Aim 3). Aims 1 and 2 will be tested in a 150-subject prospective study of patients undergoing
cardiac or vascular surgery. Blood, urine, and clinical data will be collected longitudinally throughout the
perioperative period. ApoA-I concentration will be determined with an ELISA; HDL-miRNAs will be isolated,
sequenced and quantified with RT-PCR; and HDL functional capacity to suppress ICAM-1, TLR2, and TLR4 will
be measured in vitro using human endothelial and renal proximal tubule cells stimulated with TNF-α and hypoxia
respectively. Study subjects’ HDL characteristics will be compared to their severity of renal tubule stress and
damage, quantified by urinary concentrations of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2, insulin-like growth factor-
binding protein 7, and kidney injury molecule 1 and to their severity of AKI, quantified with 48-hour serum
creatinine change from baseline using latent variable regression modeling. During Aim 3 studies, threedifferent
doses of HDL particles will be administered to mice before renal IR injury or sham surgery, and the effects of HDL
dose on renal damage will be quantified. In a second experiment, HDL containing different miRNAs will be
administered before renal IR injury to determine the effect of specific HDL-miRNAs on AKI.
By completing this study, Dr. Smith will obtain training in the management of a translational research team and
in vivo experimental design from Dr. Linton; perioperative clinical study execution and AKI phenotyping from Dr.
Billings; and HDL-associated microRNA (miRNA) sequencing and bioinformatics analysis from Dr. Vickers. In
this manner, with the support of this career development award, her mentorship team, and her institutional
environment, Dr. Smith will obtain the necessary skills to establish an independent translational research
program focused on developing novel lipoprotein-based therapies to reduce postoperative AKI."

 The concepts underlying the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D) have seen a renaissance in recent
years. Recently, there has been increased appreciation that β cells are an active, rather than passive, player
in the disease process. A key recognition is that environmental insults in T1D (e.g. inflammation, virus) trigger
molecular responses in β cells that potentiate detrimental communication with immune cells. In the next cycle
of this R01 award, we propose to extend our work to link these cell-autonomous signaling pathways to their
role in T1D pathogenesis. Our published and preliminary data demonstrate that a key inflammatory signaling
pathway in β cells, the 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX)/Gpr31 pathway, potentiates the integrated stress response
(ISR). The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cytoprotective process whereby environmental stress signals
such as proinflammatory cytokines, viral infections, and nutrient deprivation are transduced intracellularly to
activate a host of eIF2α kinases. The phosphorylation of eIF2α halts general mRNA translation initiation in an
effort to redirect energy expenditure to allay the prevailing stress. The blockade of this pathway though genetic
or pharmacologic means suppresses the ISR, reduces β cell-immune cell crosstalk, and substantially
diminishes T1D development in NOD mice. We hypothesize that inflammatory stress signaling within β cells
exacerbates the ISR to both initiate and propagate autoimmunity in T1D. We propose the following 3 aims:
Aim 1: Elucidate how 12-LOX/Gpr31 signaling links inflammatory signals to the ISR to drive T1D outcome.
Aim 2: Determine how the β cell integrated stress response (ISR) promotes T1D susceptibility.
Aim 3: Determine the mechanisms by which the 12-LOX/Gpr31 pathway and the ISR enhance cellular
crosstalk between β cells and immune cells to promote autoimmunity in T1D.
 Whereas T1D is an autoimmune disease, therapies that have exclusively targeted the immune system
have seen variable success. Recent clinical successes using drugs that block inflammation and stress
pathways more broadly suggest a need to revise therapeutic approaches to T1D. Collectively, the work
proposed in this application will harness the momentum behind β cell research in T1D to interrogate how
stress signaling pathways influence crosstalk with the immune system to potentiate autoimmunity. We are
competitively positioned with the relevant collaborative expertise and state-of-the-art, manipulable model
systems across the translational spectrum from lower organisms to humans to test our underlying hypothesis
and validate novel targets for T1D disease modification."

Treating inflammation in deep lung would help manage pain in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
as pain in COPD patients is often associated with the prolonged induction of painful stimuli from the hard-to-
reach inflammations in distal airways. Current guidelines recommend pulmonary delivery of anti-inflammatory
agents to treat COPD inflammations. However, existing nebulizer and inhalation technologies suffer from several
disadvantages including low pulmonary delivery efficiencies, hard-to-use hand-breath coordination, and the lack
of a point-of-care monitoring and dose control system of inhaled medicine for individualized treatment.
We have developed an inhalation device prototype for dose-controlled pulmonary delivery of medicines into the
deep lung. The device utilizes a novel atomizer with a “bottom-up” aerosolization technology that generates
aerosols with optimized particle sizes. Preliminary data shows that anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen) can be
aerosolized with optimized particle sizes (MMAD < 2 µm) for delivery to small distal airways. No detectable
impurities were found in aerosolized molecules and deposited aerosols yielded a significant reduction of pro-
inflammatory mucin secretion based on a 3D respiratory cell model (EpiAirway). The inhalation device contains
a built-in chip and algorithms that monitor and provide real-time consumption dosage to users and authorized
physicians. This technology platform has the potential to shift the paradigm from traditional nebulizer and inhaler
strategies for the inflammation and pain treatment in COPD and other inflammatory respiratory diseases.
In Aim 1, we plan to investigate the feasibility of delivering two categories of small anti-inflammatory molecules,
corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to distal airways using our novel inhalation
device prototype. Our investigation will involve developing formulations that are compatible with the device and
conducting rigorous gravimetric and chemical analyses to quantify the dosage, while establishing the acute
toxicity profile of the aerosolized molecules. We will also systematically adjust the simulated inhalation regimes
based on our collected data to verify the dosage algorithm and estimate the optimal dosage. Lastly, we will
employ established dosimetry models to estimate pulmonary deposition status in simulated human respiratory
tracts, providing insights into the therapeutic potential of our proposed inhalation device prototype.
In Aim 2, we plan to leverage an established inflamed multicellular model to characterize the anti-inflammatory
efficacies. Specifically, we will utilize a 3D respiratory tissue culture model, EpiAlveolar, co-cultured with
monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to mimic the inflammation phenotypes in distal airways of COPD
patients. We will assess the anti-inflammatory reactions, including cytokine and gene expression, with additional
endpoints including membrane barrier integrity and cell viability to determine the acute cytotoxicity of aerosolized
molecules. At the end of SBIR phase I project, we will have collected data on the in vitro feasibility of delivering
anti-inflammatory agents to distal airways, as well as evaluated their efficacy as a proxy for COPD pain reduction."
10820006,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Histone ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a complex post-translational modification (PTM) with strong disease
associations. ADPr occurs on all five histone proteins in diverse states (e.g., mono-, di-, tri-, poly-ADPr) that are
dynamically regulated to control various cellular functions. The proteins that add, recognize, and remove histone
ADPr are rapidly emerging as high-value therapeutic targets. For example, one class of enzymes that catalyze
histone poly-ADPr (e.g., PARPs) is the target of many FDA-approved therapeutics for cancer and part of many
on-going clinical trials for other disease indications. Despite this, an understanding of the biological roles and
therapeutic potential of histone ADPr and histone ADPr-interacting enzymes remains largely unrealized due to
a dearth of molecular tools to study ADPr in vivo and in vitro.
 The goal of this Direct-to-Phase-II proposal is to develop a novel molecular toolkit to enable the study of
histone ADPr, advancing our knowledge of this important PTM and providing access to new therapeutic targets
in an emerging segment of histone biology. EpiCypher® is pioneering the development of fully-defined designer
nucleosomes (dNucs), which we and others have shown to be the ideal physiological substrates and controls for
diverse epigenetic assays. The power of EpiCypher’s fully-defined dNuc platform stems from its broad chemical
diversity, containing >100 unique dNucs carrying the most widely studied PTM classes (e.g., lysine methylation
and acetylation, serine phosphorylation). Our team has successfully leveraged the diversity of this flagship
technology for a range of high value applications including: I) high-throughput biochemical assays for drug
discovery, inhibitor screening, and antibody profiling (EpiDyne® and dCypher® assays) and II) ultra-sensitive
genomic mapping (CUTANA® CUT&RUN / CUT&Tag assays). The central innovations of this proposal are I) the
development of a novel chemoenzymatic manufacturing approach to generate the first fully-defined histone ADPr
dNucs (ADPr-dNucs) at commercial scale and II) leveraging these novel tools to develop cutting-edge assays to
enable new avenues of histone ADPr research and access new drug targets. In Phase I Equivalent feasibility
studies, we partnered with ADPr expert Dr. Glen Liszczak of the University of Texas Southwestern to develop a
novel two-step chemoenzymatic ADPr-dNuc manufacturing method and generate a focused panel of defined
ADPr-dNucs, whose functional importance was validated in a chromatin remodeling assay. Here, we will expand
our catalog of ADPr-dNucs (Aim 1) and use these reagents to develop robust biochemical (Aim 2) and genomics
(Aim 3) assays to accelerate histone ADPr basic and drug development research. Together, this work will lead
to the development and commercialization of a first-in-class molecular toolkit for the study of histone ADPr,
enabling multiple high-value applications to drive novel research into currently inaccessible therapeutic targets."

Influenza has a significant global impact on public health each year even after the COVID-19 pandemic. In the
United States, the illness affects over 35 million people, causes 710,000 hospitalizations and about 47,000
deaths per year. The strongest public health response to this is the annual vaccine, planned and
manufactured several months ahead of the flu season. Globally, the World Health Organization makes
recommendations for vaccine content and national agencies select the most appropriate strain. The
effectiveness of the vaccine varies from year-to-year and even within the same season. Vaccine effectiveness
(VE) data guides the response of state and local public health agencies to influenza epidemics and
pandemics. VE estimates impact the success of vaccination campaigns, allow agencies to estimate the
number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by influenza, and to implement targeted public
health control measures and outreach campaigns if the VE is low. The CDC estimates VE annually through
the Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness Network (US Flu VE Network). While the CDC's efforts to track flu cases
(FluView) and vaccination rates (FluVaxView), collect data continuously from hundreds of sites, the US Flu
VE Network runs only at participating clinics in a limited number of states, with each site enrolling around
1,000 participants with influenza-like illness (ILI) each year as a part of a test-negative design. The CDC
estimates are the US gold standard but have two main limitations: (i) they include only a limited number of
states and subjects, and (ii) the interim report is not published until late into the flu season. Here, we propose
to use social media (SM) data for addressing these limitations. SM is abundantly available across the US in
near real-time and can be used as complementary data for calculating VE. Based on separately funded work,
we have already collected suitable Twitter user datasets and we propose to develop automated methods to
identify those that report taking a flu test or a diagnosis of flu. For these individuals, we will analyze their
tweets over time to determine vaccination status, test results, and demographic information. We have shown
that SM data collected using our systematic Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach can be used for
epidemiology and, per the latest Pew report, is representative of the population. Our specific aims of this
project are to: (1) develop and evaluate an NLP framework to calculate influenza VE including analysis of
timelines for concept extraction relevant to VE and (2) develop and evaluate a real-time VE estimation system
that uses longitudinal SM data and accounts for biases, uncertainty, and missing data in vaccination status or
influenza diagnosis. Real-time, early VE estimation as we propose could aid preparedness from public health
authorities and clinicians, potentially reducing influenza morbidity and mortality. If successful, this will be the
first automated approach to near real-time estimation of VE in the United States, providing a viable, relatively
low-cost alternative solution to a significant problem."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) sustain the production of all blood and immune cells throughout life by
differentiating into all blood lineages and regenerate long-lived HSC, ie self-renew. However, although HSC
have high regenerative potential, the actual capacity of ‘self-renewal’, ie regenerating a daughter cell that has
identical properties’ is limited. HSC sustain injury after bone marrow transplantation and become less functional.
A clear understanding of the mechanism responsible for HSC functional decline with HSC transplantation is still
lacking. This lack of knowledge has hampered our ability to maintain HSC functions through divisions and
improve HSCT outcomes. The overall goal of this grant application is to understand the mechanisms behind
HSC functional decline after bone marrow transplantation. We have discovered that once HSCs get activated,
mitochondria irreversibly remodel and do not return to homeostatic conditions. HSCs accumulate dysfunctional
mitochondria due to a progressive decline in mitochondrial quality control mechanisms, including reduced
mitochondrial dynamism such that HSCs carry mitochondria have that are different in shape and functions.
Mechanistically, HSC lose mitochondrial fission activity [ie, loss of the fission regulator Drp1 activity], which
causes a decrease in HSC regenerative potential. In addition, we found that HSC with high repopulation activity
in vivo have high levels of mitophagy. In contrast mitophagy is drastically reduced in HSC after transplantation.
We hypothesize that mitochondrial defects drive HSC functional decline after transplantation. The main
objectives of this project are to understand why abnormal mitochondria in HSC are not removed after bone
marrow transplantation and the impact it has on HSC functions (Aim1). Aim2 will investigate the impact of
abnormal mitochondria on HSC metabolism with a focus the mitochondrial retrograde signaling ATF4-on
carbon/folate pathway. We will test effect of metabolite supplementation in ameliorating HSC functions in vivo
during bone marrow transplantation, using both murine bone marrow transplantation and xenotransplant model
of human CD34+ into immunodeficient recipients. The proposed studies provide a unique opportunity to
examine the specific contribution of abnormal mitochondrial functions to HSC functional decline during and after
bone marrow transplantation. It will investigate the novel concept that HSCs accumulate dysfunctional
mitochondria that reprogram their metabolism driving their functional decline, which may lead to the
identification of novel approaches for pharmacological intervention to maintain HSC functions through divisions."
10821360,"One major issue confounding successful treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the presence of highly
invasive cells disseminating into the brain parenchyma. These cells evade surgical resection and often spread
distally in brain parenchyma. Multiple and spatially distinct heterotypic populations exist within a single GBM,
giving rise to the disease’s genetic heterogeneity and leading to complex cell intrinsic and extrinsic
mechanisms of invasion. Amplification of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a hallmark mutation
present in 60% of cases, most often occurs in a heterogeneous manner and is frequently associated with
deletion of exons 2-7, creating a constitutively active mutant, EGFRvIII. While significant focus has been
placed on its kinase activity, comparatively little is known about EGFRvIII’s ability to enhance migration via
interaction with adhesion receptors. Our preliminary data supports a dual role for EGFRvIII where it interferes
with intrinsic adhesion receptors and also recruits non-transformed counterparts via extrinsic signaling to
reduce adhesion of a mixed population. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that this difference in adhesive
activity is due to differential signaling associated with EGFRvIII, and that this receptor conveys this phenotype
to non-transformed counterparts through cytokine production (Inda, Genes & Dev, 2010; Zanca, Genes & Dev,
2017) to cooperatively invade parenchyma. With this hypothesis, we will use adhesion measurement
technologies to dissect cell intrinsic EGFR-mediated invasion mechanisms; given the heterogeneity within
tumors, we will also combine newly developed adhesion sorting technologies with high throughput sequencing
technologies to identify cell extrinsic mechanisms and targets for subsequent intervention. The following lines
of experimentation will be carried out: 1) implementation of biophysical assays and signaling pathway analyses
to interrogate how cell intrinsic activity of EGFRvIII leads to labile adhesion and an invasive phenotype; 2)
biochemical and functional analysis of the EGFRvIII cell extrinsic, secretome-mediated education of wtEGFR
cell adhesive phenotype; 3) expression and epigenetic analyses on adhesion-sorted populations will be used
to define a migratome signature, its stability in wtEGFR cells after exposure to the EGFRvIII secretome, and
the ability of “educated” wtEGFR to propagate that epigenetic signature to naïve wtEGFR cells."
10821432,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related inflammation and accumulation of ectopic lipid in multiple organs in elderly is associated with bone
loss, frailty and chronic diseases. For example, bone and thymus are the major primary lymphoid organs that
progressively accumulate ectopic lipid and adipocytes in humans and mouse models. The sympathetic
nervous system (SNS) regulates all organ systems by localized release of catecholamines from post-synaptic
vesicles in a rapid fashion without the time-lag required to complete events that control transcriptional
activation or post-translational regulation of specific cytokines or adipokines. The catecholamines released
from SNS in various local tissue niches is required for fatty acid oxidation, a process that is impaired in elderly.
The key questions this proposal aims to address is: A) How does aging cause accumulation of ectopic lipid in
bone marrow? B) Whether increase in ectopic lipid serves as an associative trigger for increase in bone
inflammation and osteoporosis seen during aging. C) Can one prevent bone loss and ectopic accumulation in
aging by targeting the mechanisms that link immune-metabolic crosstalk? These questions emanate from our
discovery that aging is associated with increased degradation of norepinephrine (NE) due to elevated
expression of Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA), a catecholamine degradation enzyme. The long-term goal of
this project is to decipher neuro-immune crosstalk that controls bone inflammation and to target this
mechanism to develop new approaches to maintain or enhance bone function in elderly."
10819263,"Project Summary
Our goal is to develop a first-in-class oral peptide inhibitor for the treatment and prevention of gingivitis and
periodontitis. Oral infection by P. gingivalis leads to inflammation and bleeding of the gums, called gingivitis,
and eventually bone and tooth loss, called periodontitis3. Almost 50% of adults worldwide over the age of thirty
have periodontal disease, making it one of the most common infections in humans11, 72. P. gingivalis infection is
also closely associated with several other chronic health conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease,
cardiovascular disease, cancer, and arthritis9, 12-16, 27.
P. gingivalis is considered a causative species in periodontitis that can function to shape the overall microbial
community leading to dysbiosis and tissue damage4-7. Clinical research has confirmed that initial P. gingivalis
colonization occurs outside the subgingival pocket38-40. P. gingivalis adheres efficiently to supragingival
bacteria such as commensal streptococci32-34. This adherence modulates the pathogenic potential of P.
gingivalis and drives colonization35-37. Thus, inhibiting the adherence of P. gingivalis to supragingival bacteria
represents an excellent approach to reducing and preventing periodontitis.
Our project team originally discovered that initial colonization of the oral cavity by P. gingivalis is mediated by
the minor fimbrial antigen Mfa1 of P. gingivalis binding to the surface antigen SspB of Streptococcus gordonii32,
42-44. Subsequently, we identified a domain in SspB essential to this binding45, 46. A synthetic peptide derived
from this region functions as a potent inhibitor of P. gingivalis adherence and formation of biofilms45, 46. In
addition, the synthetic peptide demonstrates inhibition of P. gingivalis virulence by preventing colonization and
subsequent alveolar bone loss in mouse models of severe periodontitis35.
Building from this innovative work, our objective is to advance this first-in-class, cyclic peptide (called VTC-880)
towards the clinic for the treatment and prevention of gingivitis and periodontitis. The key aims of this proposal
are to: 1) manufacture VTC-880 and establish potency and analytical assays, 2) determine the optimal
formulation and in vitro PK of VTC-880 in human saliva, 3) establish the oral PK and optimal effective dose
for VTC-880 in mice, 4) generate acute toxicology profiles for VTC-880 in mice and in a human saliva biofilm
model, and 5) finalize our IND-enabling and clinical study plan to advance VTC-880 into a clinical study."
10804784,"The long-term goal of this work is to improve centralized pain management in older adults. Pain may be
categorized as neuropathic, nociceptive, or nociplastic (i.e., centralized). Management of these pains should
differ based on their etiology. Medications should be chosen that target this (Mechanistic-Based Pain Therapy,
MBPT). Patient outcomes in other populations have improved when MBPT has been used.
The objective of this work is to understand medication use in older adult cancer survivors with centralized pain,
focusing on provider decision-making and practice patterns. This knowledge is fundamental to the creation of a
clinical decision support system. With the growing population of older adult cancer survivors and the risks of
medications (Potentially Inappropriate Medications, PIMs), there is a critical need to improve the appropriate
use of medications to manage centralized pain. Survivorship guidelines provide no direction specific to older
adults or centralized pain. Our central hypothesis is that centralized pain experienced by older adult cancer
survivors will vary by age in terms of diagnoses, MBPT, and PIM use. To test this hypothesis an explanatory
sequential mixed methods design was developed with the following aims to meet the stated objectives:
Aim 1: Determine the effect of age on developing centralized pain among older adult cancer survivors
in the U.S. before and after cancer diagnosis.
H1: Increasing age will be related to greater likelihood of centralized pain before and after cancer diagnosis.
This quantitative aim will utilize newly validated methods34,35 to estimate the effect of age independent of other
predictors on developing centralized pain among cancer survivors ≥ 66 years of age who are diagnosed with
centralized pain before and after cancer diagnosis using the SEER-Medicare database. This aim will provide
training related to large datasets and responsible conduct of research (RCR) using secondary data.
Aim 2: Quantify effect of MBPT on PIM use among older adult cancer survivors with centralized pain.
H2: Higher MBPT will be correlated with lower PIM use among older adult cancer survivors. This quantitative
aim will innovatively advance the previous methods34,35 using centralized pain diagnosis codes to determine
MBPT and PIM prevalence by matching medication claims to diagnoses. This aim will provide training related
to pain pathophysiology, treatment of centralized pain, and large dataset management.
Aim 3: Identify facilitators/barriers to centralized pain management in older adult cancer survivors.
This integrative aim will use interviews of oncologists, geriatricians, and PCPs (n~30) (qualitative) in
combination with prescribing profiles of participants (quantitative) to characterize centralized pain management
using a theoretical framework.36 Independent intramethod analysis and explanatory integration will be used to
understand centralized pain management in older adult cancer survivors. This aim will provide training related
to mixed methods, pain pathophysiology, and RCR of interviews."
10804786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dysregulated activity within the neural networks that underlie reward and executive functions can increase
vulnerability to compulsive drug use. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can selectively
modulate neural activity within both the reward and the executive control networks. Empirical evidence indicates
that both inhibitory rTMS to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC, a key node in the reward circuits) and
excitatory rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, a key node of the executive control network) can
be therapeutic in individuals with SUDs. However, responses to both treatments are highly variable and rTMS’
therapeutic utility for SUDs remains limited. Personalizing rTMS interventions targeting neuromarkers of
dysregulated activity within the reward and cognitive control networks is likely to reduce treatment response
variability and improve treatment outcomes. We have recently identified two robust neuromarkers of reward
responses to drug-related cues and cognitive control during drug-related decisions that reliably predict nicotine
self-administration. The goal of this application is to determine the extent to which these neuromarkers moderate
responses to rTMS. Our central hypothesis is that smokers with high reactivity to drug-related cues will be more
likely to reduce nicotine self-administration after inhibitory rTMS to the VMPFC, whereas smokers with low
cognitive control during drug-related decisions will be more likely to reduce nicotine self-administration after
excitatory rTMS to the DLPFC. In line with the scope of PAR-19-282 (Exploratory Clinical Neuroscience
Research on SUDs), we will use a phased research approach to test our hypothesis. In the R61 phase, we will
determine the extent to which the reward reactivity neuromarker (Aim 1) and the cognitive control (Aim 2)
neuromarker moderate rTMS treatment effects. To test our milestones (i.e., observing a medium or higher effect
size in at least one of the two aims), we will use Bayesian statistical methods. Using a Bayesian approach will
allow us to obtain calibrated probabilities of treatment outcomes and make a principled go/no-go decision in
moving forward to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will determine the synergistic effect of the two
neuromarkers in moderating rTMS treatment effects (Aim 3) and we will create a Bayesian classifier to
personalize future rTMS interventions for SUDs (Aim 4). We anticipate that upon its successful conclusion, this
Phase II trial will contribute to illuminate the psychophysiological mechanisms that drive compulsive drug use
and will yield the fundamental knowledge needed to efficiently develop new personalized rTMS interventions for
SUDs and other disorders characterized by poor impulse control."

For youth with chronic kidney disease (CKD), cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and
early mortality. Youth with CKD are less physically active than their healthy peers. They also have lower muscle
strength, which may be a proxy for overall physical inactivity or could represent an independent predictor of CVD.
Physical activity is a well-recognized determinant of health and quality of life, but physical activity’s effects on
muscle strength may be compromised in CKD. Characterizing the relationships between physical activity, muscle
strength and CVD can inform potential therapeutic targets to improve cardiac outcomes. Identification of effective
strategies to increase physical activity, and the extent to which physical activity and muscle strength mitigate
CVD complications are major knowledge gaps in pediatric CKD research.
Aim 1 will test the efficacy of a 12-week physical activity intervention in 64 adolescents with CKD. Guided by the
Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework, an optimization trial will identify intervention components
that increase average daily moderate to vigorous physical activity by 15 min/day, a clinically meaningful increase.
The components will be grounded in established behavioral change theories and be delivered via Way to Health,
a web-based platform, to overcome barriers at the point of clinical care where time and resources are limited.
Aim 2 will leverage existing longitudinal data from the Chronic Kidney Disease in Children Study (CKiD) to
determine the extent to which physical activity and muscle strength mitigate CVD complications. This aim will
quantify the associations of self-reported physical activity and hand grip strength, a validated proxy of muscle
strength, with early changes in cardiac structure and function: left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic
dysfunction. Left ventricular hypertrophy, defined by an elevated left ventricular mass index, is the most common
cardiac abnormality in children with CKD and is the strongest predictor of sudden cardiac events in adults with
CKD. Diastolic dysfunction occurs early in pediatric CKD and associates with death in adults with CKD.
These aims will advance knowledge by identifying the optimized digital-based intervention components, specific
to youth with CKD, to increase physical activity and by quantifying the impact of physical activity and muscle
strength on CVD. They are responsive to the NIDDK Strategic Plan for Research by utilizing 1) technology to
improve access to participants; 2) an innovative trial design; 3) direct participant feedback to engage
stakeholders; and 4) data from an existing NIH-funded cohort study. Within the outstanding research
environment of The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the University of Pennsylvania and under the
mentorship of Drs. Sandra Amaral, Babette Zemel, and Knashawn Morales, this K23 provides training in
longitudinal data analysis, health behavior science, and clinical trial design and analysis, incorporating digitally
based tools. This will launch the PI’s career as a pediatric nephrology researcher with unique expertise in health
behavior change and digital-based interventions to improve the health and longevity of youth living with CKD."
10805729,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and primary tauopathies are disorders in which the aggregation and accumulation of
tau plays a key role in pathogenesis. In AD, tau aggregation and accumulation begins in the medial temporal
lobe and extends into several neocortical regions just as cognitive decline begins and its progressive
accumulation significantly correlates with neuronal/synaptic loss, regional brain atrophy, and
neurodegeneration. Importantly, the regional presence and progression of brain atrophy and functional decline
in both primary tauopathies and in AD highly correlates with tau accumulation. We have produced mice that
develop tau pathology and tau-mediated neurodegeneration that are crossed onto a human APOE knockin (KI)
background (P301S tau transgenic mice that express human APOE isoforms). We found that tau-mediated
neurodegeneration is dependent on the presence of APOE with APOE4 resulting in greater damage than other
APOE isoforms. The tau-linked neurodegeneration also requires microglia. While the tau-associated damage is
dependent on the brain’s innate immune response via microglia, little is known about the extent and role of the
adaptive immune responses in the presence of amyloid-β (Aβ) or tau pathology. Importantly, the contribution of
the adaptive immune response to tau-mediated neurodegeneration has been unclear. We recently compared
the immunological milieus in the brain of mice with amyloid deposition or tau aggregation and
neurodegeneration. We found that mice with tauopathy but not amyloid, developed a unique innate and
adaptive immune response and that depletion of microglia or T cells strongly attenuated tau-mediated
neurodegeneration. Both CD4 and CD8 T cells were markedly increased in areas with tau pathology in P301S
mice and in the AD brain. T cell numbers correlated with the extent of neuronal loss, and dynamically
transformed their cellular characteristics from activated to exhausted states along with unique TCR clonal
expansion. Inhibition of molecules either secreted by T cells (IFN-γ) or present on the surface of some T cells
(PD-1) both significantly ameliorated brain atrophy. Our results have revealed a tauopathy and
neurodegeneration-related immune hub involving activated microglia and T cell responses. Given these data,
we hypothesize that understanding the role and interactions of T cells, microglia, and antigen presenting cells
in tau-mediated neurodegeneration will provide novel insights into the tau-mediated pathogenesis as well as
provide new therapeutic targets for preventing neurodegeneration in AD and primary tauopathies. This
hypothesis will be tested in 3 Aims. Aim 1 will investigate the mechanisms underlying T cell activation and role
of effector functions in microglia and T cells in tau-dependent neurodegeneration. Aim 2 will investigate
potential antigen T cell receptor interactions that are relevant to T cell activation in P301S Tau Tg mice. Aim 3
will test whether different classes of clinically-approved immunosuppressant drugs that affect T cells can
reduce tau pathology and neurodegeneration."
10805733,"Project Summary
Cardiorespiratory conditions such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), congestive heart failure,
COVID pneumonia, and sepsis are among the most common causes of mortality and morbidity. They are also
notable for high rates of persistent psychological distress symptoms including depression, anxiety, and PTSD that
worsen quality of life and outcomes of the underlying conditions. Yet there are few effective strategies able to
overcome barriers of limited access to mental health care. Even less is known about distress management among
people from structurally disadvantaged backgrounds such as racially and ethnically minoritized populations
because of their suboptimal representation in relevant clinical trials.
To fill this gap, we developed Blueprint, an adaptive coping skills training intervention, and have optimized it over
years of research. We conducted a multicenter RCT (PCORI PFA 195) of a telephone- and web-based version
among those recently hospitalized with serious cardiorespiratory conditions, finding that it reduced depression
symptoms and improved quality of life among those with elevated baseline distress. Informed by lessons learned
about intervention delivery and eligibility criteria, we next conducted a single-center pilot RCT (R34 HL145387)
that targeted a broader population and tested a completely automated, self-guided, symptom-responsive mobile
app version of Blueprint. We found excellent adherence and a strong effect on depression, anxiety, PTSD, and
quality of life compared to control.
Given these promising findings, a formal test of the Blueprint adaptive coping skills training intervention’s efficacy
is needed. Therefore, we propose a 5-year multicenter RCT with 6-month follow up in which 400 cardiorespiratory
failure survivors with elevated symptoms of psychological distress post-discharge are randomized to either
Blueprint or an Education Program control, both delivered through similar mobile app platforms. Our specific aims
will: (1) Test Blueprint vs. control on symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and quality of life; (2) Determine
patient-level characteristics associated with a great treatment response among sociodemographic subgroups of
interest, also applying a heterogeneity of treatment effects analysis to identify other groups of clinical relevance;
and (3) Ensure off-the-shelf intervention readiness for implementation by using an exploratory mixed-methods
hybrid type 1 implementation framework analysis that integrates semi-structured interviews with trial participants
and quantitative trial data from Aims 1 and 2. This DCC proposal will provide the data management infrastructure
and will maintain study integrity. Innovative elements include a fully automated mobile health delivery system that
personalizes content in response to changes in symptom trajectories, a focus on racially and ethnically minoritized
persons, the integration of a Spanish language intervention version, and strong community engagement. This
project addresses national research priorities and could advance the field with a personalizable yet population-
focused therapy that could be scaled broadly and efficiently to enhance mental health equity."
10806400,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Females with groin hernia, the most common condition encountered by general surgeons in the US,
receive inferior care. While male patients are offered a choice between surgery and watchful waiting (i.e., non-
operative management), guidelines recommend surgery for all females regardless of symptoms or preference.
Moreover, females have been excluded from all major trials informing best practices for groin hernia.
Importantly, watchful waiting has never been evaluated among females. As a result, nearly 100,000 females
undergo potentially avoidable surgery every year, likely contributing to the high rates of chronic post-operative
pain and poor quality of life observed in this population. A clinical trial evaluating watchful waiting vs surgery
among females would definitively answer whether watchful waiting is a safe and acceptable strategy for
females with groin hernia. Unfortunately, most clinical trials ultimately fail or have minimal impact due to
common barriers including lack of adequate sample size to detect differences in outcomes, selection of
outcome metrics that do not matter to patients, and insufficient enrollment. Prior to conducting a clinical trial to
assess watchful waiting in females (the candidate’s future R01 application), we must address these barriers.
This proposal will address these key gaps and ultimately will lead to a patient-centered clinical trial studying
surgery compared to watchful waiting in females with groin hernia. Leveraging the data and infrastructure from
the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative Core Optimization Hernia Registry, a novel, population-based
hernia collaborative, we will explore patient-reported outcomes following groin hernia repair, elicit patient
priorities around the most important outcome metrics to study in a clinical trial, and determine the feasibility
and acceptability of a clinical trial. The aims of this research proposal are to 1) Evaluate patient reported
outcomes following groin hernia repair among female patients, 2) Elicit patient priorities surrounding research
in groin hernia to inform outcome metrics for a clinical trial repair, and 3) Determine the feasibility and
acceptability of a clinical trial for females with groin hernia. The research plan will develop the preliminary data
and infrastructure necessary for a future patient-centered clinical trial. The project, the multidisciplinary
mentorship team, and educational plan are ideally suited to address the career goals of the candidate, Anne P.
Ehlers, MD, MPH. Dr. Ehlers is board-certified in general surgery with a clinical and research interest in hernia
care. In additional to the innovative research plan described here, this proposal will provide Dr. Ehlers with
methodologic training in real-world data analysis, advanced qualitative methodology, and clinical trial design.
This project will lay the groundwork for Dr. Ehlers to become an independent health services researcher with

10920456,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental disorder associated with high cost that is transmitted
intergenerationally. The interpersonal phenotype of BPD is characterized by hypersensitivity, hostile attribution
bias, and maladaptive desire for exclusivity in relationships. Features of this phenotype can be identified in
childhood and are associated with internalizing and externalizing pathology as well as later development of BPD.
Aligned with the 2021 NIMH Strategic Plan, to identify malleable targets for prevention of psychopathology, it is
necessary to study the unfolding of this critical mechanism prior to the onset of symptomatology. This proposal
aims to do so among high-risk youth (based on maternal psychopathology) during middle childhood (ages 7-9;
50% female), a critical time for interpersonal development. This study measures the interpersonal features of
BPD in the context of child-friend interactions to leverage multi-modal assessment and to focus on a central
relationship of this developmental phase. Specific aims of the study are to 1) Test whether offspring of mothers
with BPD (n=60) exhibit interpersonal features of BPD during middle childhood compared to offspring of mothers
with depression (n=60) and non-disordered mothers (n=40); 2) Determine the extent to which BPD interpersonal
features in middle childhood impede the development of friendship; and 3) Test associations between BPD
interpersonal features and development of psychopathology in children. Friendship stability and quality and child
psychopathology (internalizing, externalizing, BPD features) will be assessed at baseline and 6-months. The
central hypothesis is that relative to controls, offspring of mothers with BPD are at highest risk of exhibiting
interpersonal dysfunction that is specific to BPD during middle childhood. These behaviors have a negative effect
on a central developmental milestone of middle childhood: fostering of closeness in friendship, which increases
risk a range of psychopathology including BPD. The candidate, Dr. Vanwoerden, is a clinical psychologist
seeking to transition to an independent research program focused on the early identification and prevention of
BPD. This project is a first step toward this goal with a comprehensive training plan addressing the research
questions while building on previous experiences in important ways. First, she will obtain training on the inclusion
and assessment of children and friends in research. Second, she will focus on (dyadic) measurement and
interpretation of electrodermal activity as a physiological marker of hypersensitivity. Third, she will gain
proficiency in longitudinal research design, including retention of high-risk families and the analysis of data using
methods aligned with dynamic systems theory. Drs. Stephanie Stepp, Amanda Rose, and Lauren Bylsma who
have expertise in the developmental psychopathology of BPD, friendship processes, and psychophysiological
assessment, respectively, will jointly mentor Dr. Vanwoerden. The research and training plan will be conducted
at the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Psychiatry, a leading research institution with extensive research
support, world class developmental psychopathology researchers, and state-of-the-art facilities."
10806533,"Project Summary: Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia. Therapies aim to
control risk factors (e.g. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus) to prevent development or
worsening of disease. Recent studies show that viral infections are potentially modifiable risk factors for
dementia. Amongst all pathogens, varicella zoster virus (VZV) is the most likely contributor to vascular
dementia. VZV is a neurotropic DNA virus that is latent in >95% of Americans and reactivates to produce
herpes zoster (shingles) in 50% by 85 years of age. Despite the availability of zoster vaccines, there are still >1
mil cases of zoster annually. Recent studies reveal zoster increases dementia risk and treatment (vaccines,
antivirals) reduces risk. Importantly, a recent FinnGen and U.K. biobank study showed VZV was specifically
associated with an increased risk of vascular dementia. VZV likely contributes to vascular dementia risk
through its well-established ability to produce vascular pathology leading to ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke
(VZV vasculopathy). VZV directly infects cerebral arteries and causes a vasculitis, as well as induces a
prothrombotic state triggering cerebral thrombosis. A notable feature is the involvement of soluble factors that
promote vasculitis or thrombosis distal from the site of rash. We recently showed that plasma exosomes
isolated from acute zoster patients contained significantly elevated prothrombotic and proinflammatory proteins
including thrombospondin-1, caveolae-associated protein 2, coagulation factors V and XIIIA1, calmodulin 1,
and transthyretin compared to matched controls. These exosomes were non-infectious but induced IL-6 and
IL-8 secretion when applied to naïve primary human brain vascular adventitial fibroblasts, activated donor
platelets, and induced platelet-leukocyte aggregations supporting a proinflammatory and prothrombotic state.
Importantly, these exosomes persist for at least 3 months post-zoster, well after rash clearance and detectable
viremia. Overall, we hypothesize that circulating exosomes during zoster and in subsequent months will
promote vasculitis and thrombosis, thus providing a mechanistic basis for the increased vascular dysfunction
risk preceding vascular dementia. To test this hypothesis, we will isolate plasma exosomes from individuals
during acute zoster and at 7 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months post-zoster, as well as isolate
exosomes from matched control individuals during a single clinic visit. Aim 1 will analyze exosome content for
known vascular damaging proteins/miRNAs from matched control and zoster individuals over a 12-month
period. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism(s) in which non-infectious zoster exosomes promote vascular
dysfunction. Understanding how long-lasting pathogenic exosomes promote cerebrovascular disease during
and after zoster, thereby accelerating vascular dementia risk, is significant because it will potentially change
clinical practice with regards to duration of antiviral therapy and use of anti-platelet agents for zoster, as well as
increase support for vaccination to prevent rash and stroke, as well as to decrease vascular dementia risk."

Asthma prevalence has increased in recent years with 8.4% of adults diagnosed with asthma. Asthma can be
a lifelong disease. These rates increase with age, are 60% higher in women than men and are especially high
in African Americans. Thus, adult asthma is a major health concern. Rates of uncontrolled asthma also
increase with age and are higher in women and in minorities, especially Hispanics. Texas, where the proposed
study will take place, has the third highest rate of uncontrolled asthma; therefore, more effective treatments for
adult asthma are needed. Asthma patients with frequent exacerbations despite appropriate treatment pose a
particular challenge. New treatments are needed to improve asthma control in this subpopulation. Our pilot
data from three preliminary studies suggest that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) citalopram
and escitalopram, as compared to placebo, improve asthma control and decrease asthma exacerbations in
depressed people with very frequent exacerbations. Effect sizes for exacerbations were much greater than for
depression improvement. In addition, baseline depressive symptom severity did not predict asthma
improvement. Thus, the asthma effect did not appear to be related to depression improvement. These clinical
trial findings were supported by an electronic medical record analysis suggesting patients with asthma, who did
not have a depression diagnosis, showed reductions in prednisone use after receiving SSRIs. SSRIs might
improve asthma control through effects on subclinical anxiety and depressive symptoms or psychological
triggers of asthma or independent of emotions through anti-inflammatory effects. In vitro studies suggest
SSRIs reduce the frequency of IL-4- and IL-2-producing cells triggered by CD3 stimulation and potentiate
glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene transcription, suggesting they might enhance the effects of inhaled
steroids. SSRIs also decrease IL-6 levels, which are elevated with asthma. In animal models of allergic
asthma, SSRIs reduce bronchial inflammation with decreases in macrophages, lymphocytes, neutrophils and
eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. A single-site investigator-initiated clinical trial (R61/R33) is
proposed to examine escitalopram compared to placebo in adults with asthma requiring frequent steroid bursts
but without current major depressive disorder. A milestone-driven R61 start-up phase of less than one year will
set the stage for the R33 phase 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram in
105 men and women with moderate to severe persistent asthma who, despite treatment with medium-high
dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonist therapy, had ≥ 3 asthma exacerbations in the past
year. Need for steroid bursts (primary outcome) and asthma control, as well as functioning, quality of life,
serum IL-6 levels and exhaled nitric oxide, will be assessed. Effects on mood and anxiety will be explored and
their influence on asthma control assessed. An experienced investigative team with a long history of
collaboration and expertise in asthma, SSRIs, clinical trials and statistical analysis will conduct the study."
10808983,"People with clinically defined normal hearing frequently report difficulty hearing in challenging environments.
They often leave audiology clinics with no diagnosis to explain the difficulty they experience listening in noise.
Studies in adults demonstrate that extended high frequency (EHF; > 8 kHz) hearing, beyond the currently tested
range of clinical audiometry, contributes to speech perception in noise. Young children are the most sensitive to
EHFs, and this sensitivity is progressively lost throughout the remainder of life. Previous studies found a
significant relationship between EHF hearing loss (EHFHL) and difficulty understanding speech-in-noise (SiN)
in adults with clinically normal hearing. However, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated this relationship
in typically-developing, normal-hearing children and youth. The present study aims to address this gap by
investigating the association between EHFHL and impaired SiN perception in children and young adults (8 to 30
y/o) with clinically normal hearing (≤ 20 dB HL, 0.25 - 0.8 kHz). There are three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will
establish the relationship between EHFHL and subjective reports of listening difficulties using standard (0.25-8
kHz) and EHF (9 - 16 kHz) audiometry. The adult and child versions of the Speech, Spatial and Qualities (SSQ)
questionnaire will measure self- and parent-reported difficulty listening in noise. In Aim 2 we will determine the
impact of EHFHL on the perception of spatial speech using the sound-field digits-in-noise (sfDIN) test. In Aim 3,
we will evaluate low-frequency correlates of EHFHL and their possible effect on SiN. Objective (chirp transient-
evoked otoacoustic emissions) and behavioral (spectro-temporal modulation task) measures of supra-threshold
hearing will be used to determine whether supra-threshold deficits at standard frequencies (≤ 8 kHz) account for
associations between EHFHL and SiN that have been observed for adults and are predicted for children.
Outcomes of these experiments will enhance our understanding of the impact of EHFHL on communication
abilities of children. If EHFHL contributes to the difficulty children experience in challenging environments, as we
hypothesize, then including EHF hearing assessment in an audiologic test battery could identify susceptible
individuals and in turn lead to prevention and early intervention for hearing loss."

Biology is full of stunning examples of emergent behaviors – behaviors that arise from, but cannot be reduced
to, the interactions of the constituent parts that make up the system under consideration. These behaviors
span the full spectrum of length scales, from the emergence of distinct cell fates (e.g. neurons, muscle, etc.)
due to the interactions of genes within cells, to the formation of complex ecological communities arising from
the interactions of thousands of species. The overarching goal of my research is to develop new
conceptual, theoretical, and computational tools to model such emergent, system-level behaviors in
biology. To do so, we utilize an interdisciplinary approach that is grounded in Biological and Statistical
Physics, but that draws heavily from Machine Learning, Information Theory, and Theoretical Ecology. Our work
is unified and distinguished by our deep commitment to integrating theory with the vast amount of
biological data now being generated by experiment. An important goal of the proposed research is to find
common concepts and tools that transcend traditional biological sub-disciplines and model systems.
The proposed research pursues three distinct but conceptually interrelated research directions: (1)
identifying the ecological principles governing community assembly in microbial communities and developing
techniques for understanding function, diversity, and stability in microbiomes; (2) developing new mathematical
and computational tools for modeling information processing in biochemical networks, especially the gene
networks underlying cellular identity and the signaling networks that control collective behavior in the NIH
model organism Dictyostelium discoideum; and (3) understanding and developing new interpretable machine
learning techniques for systems and synthetic biology, with special attention paid to the unique challenges
posed by living systems with regards to data heterogeneity, biological interpretability, and potential sources of
bias. In addition to developing physics-based and machine learning-inspired models for diverse biological
phenomena, the proposed research will yield a series of practical and important computational tools and
algorithms which we will make publically available including: (1) our “Community Simulator” Python package
for simulating microbial communities based on the novel microbial consumer resource model framework we
have developed; (2) new machine learning and statistical algorithms for analyzing microbial communities and
gene networks; and (3) new computational tools for predicting the behavior of synthetic biological parts and
circuits in diverse contexts. These computational tools will allow scientists to leverage the power of modern
theory, computation, and advances in Deep Learning to tackle fundamental problems relevant to human
disease."
10795857,"Project Summary
Like Alzheimer's disease, prion diseases (prionoses) are conformational disorders, in which deposition of
misfolded proteins is accompanied by microglia neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD) displaying mixed
phagocytic and inflammatory properties. Prion mouse models with misfolded protein driven neurodegeneration
and activated glia response can be used to uncover Alzheimer's disease relevant pathomechanisms. APOE ε4
allele is the foremost risk factor in sporadic Alzheimer's disease, increasing its odds by 3 and 15-fold in hetero
and homozygotes, respectively. APOE encodes apolipoprotein (apo) E, which controls brain lipid homeostasis
and modulates Alzheimer's disease risk through isoform-specific effect on clearance and deposition of soluble
Aβ. ApoE is expressed by astrocytes in form of apoE/HDLs and also by MGnD as lipid-poor particles. Differential
contributions of these two apoE pools to MGnD properties remain unclear. While lipidated apoE may facilitate
clearance of misfolded proteins, expression of lipid-poor apoE by MGnD is linked to their pro-inflammatory
properties, which also are differentially controlled by APOE genotype. In prionoses, accumulation of toxic PrPSc
protein is the culprit of pathogenesis. Microglia undergo activation early in the course of disease and exert
opposing roles in PrPSc mediated neurodegeneration. While clearance of PrPSc has a disease-limiting effect,
microglia-driven neuroinflammation is deleterious to neurons. Involvement of apoE in prion pathogenesis has
not been established, though there is evidence for ~2-fold higher risk of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) in ε4 carriers. Our preliminary work shows increased brain apoE level in prion infected mice along with
reduced apoE expression in astrocytes and increased expression in activated microglia. The overall effect of
apoE in prionoses is beneficial as global Apoe KO exacerbates prion pathology by aggravating the vicious cycle
of neuronal death and neuroinflammation. In Apoe-/- mice, clearance of PrPSc and dying neurons by MGnD
becomes inefficient while neuronal debris exaggerate MGnD phenotype, release of inflammatory cytokines, and
induce A1 neurotoxic astrocytes. Our studies also suggest, apoE effect in prionoses is isoform dependent. ε4/ε4
targeted replacement (TR) mice have shorter disease incubation time, increased pathology load and microglia
hyperactivation compared to ε3/ε3 and ε2/ε2 mice. This preliminary work led us to hypothesize 1) apoE
involvement in prion pathogenesis is by control of microglia response to PrPSc mediated neurodegeneration; 2)
apoE-based approaches have therapeutic merit in prionoses; and 3) effect of apoE in human prionoses is isoform
dependent. These hypotheses shall be explored in grant's specific aims. Aim I will assess the role of astrocyte
vs. microglia-expressed apoE on PrPSc mediated neurodegeneration in mice with cell-specific conditional Apoe
knock out. Aim II will assess whether regulating lipidation level of astrocytic and microglial apoE and the total
brain apoE level modulates neurodegeneration. Aim III will explore effects of APOE genotype on microglia
activation phenotype in prion infected APOE TR mice and in sporadic CJD and Alzheimer's disease patients."

Sensory processing disorder is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder
and intellectual disability, affecting 1 in 20 children. Increasing evidence reveal that the maternal environment
strongly impacts the etiopathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting in utero factors such as the
maternal gut microbiota holds profound influence on fetal brain development. Therefore, understanding the role
of maternal gut microbes in the development of neural circuits and abnormal behaviors can provide insights to
the underlying mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent work has illuminated mechanisms that
occur during gestation whereby the absence of the maternal gut microbiota yields offspring with altered fetal
brain gene expression, reduced fetal thalamocortical axon development, and abnormal tactile sensory behavior
in later life. This proposal aims to explore how maternal gut microbiota alters fetal brain development. In Aim 1
(K99), the role of the maternal gut microbiome in the development of prenatal microglia will be determined by
single-cell RNA sequencing of microglia gene expression, CLARITY imaging of microglia morphology and in vivo
imaging of awake animals during somatosensory behaviors for microglia function. Aim 2 of this proposal (K99)
will employ a depletion and novel “add-back” approach of embryonic microglia from specific pathogen-free (SPF)
brains, which have a normal gut microbiota, into embryonic brains of offspring from dams that are germ-free
(GF) or antibiotic-treated (ABX), which are depleted of the maternal gut microbiome. This set of experiments will
address the causal role of microglia and test whether prenatal microglia mediate maternal gut microbiome effects
on brain development. Since microglial activation is implicated in behavioral deficits seen in autism spectrum
disorder and schizophrenia, R00 will leverage techniques developed in the K99 phase to ask whether maternal
gut microbiota contributes to the effects of microglial activation on fetal brain development and later life
behaviors. The successful completion of these aims could lead to new biological targets for therapeutic
intervention, while also expanding our understanding of microbes during development of the central nervous
system. These proposed experiments will provide me with new training in methodologies (single cell RNA
sequencing and analysis, and in vivo imaging of awake behaving animals) and concepts (microglial biology) to
serve as the foundation of an independent research laboratory that will study maternal gut microbes and
neuroimmune development, and elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing
neurodevelopmental disorders. This work will be completed at UCLA, where the opportunities for technical and
intellectual growth are innumerable. I will attend regular meetings with mentors and collaborators to receive
feedback on experimental design and career advice. I will attend grant writing and research seminars at UCLA,
while also improving my communication skills by presenting at scientific conferences. Together, this career
development award will help me establish and lead a successful neurodevelopmental biology research group."
10795952,"Melanoma: Metabolic Biomarkers of Response to Targeted Therapy
Project Summary/Abstract
Disseminated metastatic melanoma is initially treated with inhibitors of the V600E mutated BRAF kinase, a
component of the MAPK signaling pathway that controls the replication of melanoma cells. More than half of
melanoma patients express this mutation and are at least initially responsive to its inhibition. However, all pa-
tients eventually become resistant to these inhibitors and have to be treated with alternate therapy, which con-
sists primarily of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The goal of this project is to develop an imaging method that
could monitor the effectiveness of BRAF kinase inhibitors and can promptly and accurately detect resistance to
these agents. Our strategy for achieving this goal is to study the detailed biochemical mechanism of BRAF ki-
nase signaling on the premise that a change in tumor metabolism is a quicker and more reliable indicator of the
onset of resistance than a change in tumor volume, which can require weeks to months to become reliably
manifest. We will use 13C MRS and liquid chromatography mass-spectrometry (LC-MS) to study the mecha-
nism of BRAF metabolic inhibition, but these methods are not suitable for in vivo detection in humans – 13C
MRS is not sensitive enough and LC-MS is invasive. Therefore, our strategy is to identify suitable biomarkers
of metabolic response that can be monitored by 1H MRS or MRI monitored chemical exchange saturation
transfer (CEST), which is about 500 times more sensitive than 1H MRS but requires high magnetic field instru-
ments operating at ≥ 7T. In contrast, 1H MRS can be monitored at 1.5T or 3T, for which instruments are avail-
able at many more medical institutions. Our second objective is to delineate how the biomarkers of BRAF inhi-
bition work in order to better appreciate their capabilities and limitations. Finally, preliminary data from our own
lab and from others indicates that the onset of resistance to mutant BRAF inhibitors involves a transition of the
tumor from dependence on aerobic glycolysis to substantially greater dependence on ox-phos and on glutami-
nolysis. This has led to clinical trials of the use of inhibitors of ox-phos such as metformin and phenformin to
delay the onset of resistance. As our third objective, we propose to test the feasibility of using CB-839, an in-
hibitor of glutaminase to block the transition to glutamine-dependence as a method to inhibit the onset of BRAF
resistance. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1 will determine biochemical changes and effectiveness of MAPK
pathway inhibition in murine and human models of melanoma. Aim 2 will elucidate substrate limitations on bio-
chemical effects and biomarker response to changes in microenvironment. Aim 3 will validate the proposed
biomarkers in an in vivo system where the treatment response is modified using a glutaminase inhibitor.
Clinical Impact: This project will enable detection of melanoma response to targeted therapy by NMR meth-
ods that have already been implemented in the clinic on conventional 1.5T and 3T instruments and on 7T in-
struments that are becoming progressively more common. Metabolomic studies will expand our ability to quan-
tify tumor metabolism in cells, in mouse and human models, and eventually in humans."

Ventral striatal dopamine progressively rises as rodents navigate toward spatially distant rewards, a surprising
recent finding that was not anticipated by temporal difference learning models of dopamine function. Ramping
dopamine release in the ventral striatum reflects the value and proximity of goals, scaling by the value of the
reward and stretching or compressing in different environments to span the distance between start and goal
locations. Activity in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons also ramps up as animals approach
goals, but the strength and persistence of ramping activity in dopamine neurons depends on both the use of an
internal model of goal proximity and on the amount of task experience. Ramping activity in dopamine neurons
appears immediately when naïve mice run toward newly-discovered rewards in spatial environments, and
ramps gradually fade away over several days of training if sensory information about reward proximity is
available. When an internal representation of progress toward the goal is required, however, robust ramping
activity in dopamine neurons persists indefinitely. These findings suggest the hypothesis that ramping activity
in VTA dopamine neurons depends on the use of brain regions that represent an internal model of the
environment and current progress toward goals. We propose to test this overarching hypothesis by addressing
the following specific aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that neural activity in the ventral hippocampus contributes to
ramping activity in midbrain dopamine neurons. 2) Compare the evolution of ramping activity in VTA dopamine
neurons with the evolution of ramping dopamine release in the ventral striatum. 3) Characterize neural activity
in VTA GABA neurons during spatial and non-spatial navigation to rewards. Understanding the neural
mechanisms that underlie ramping activity in dopamine neurons will have relevance for the neural basis of
cognitive control, goal-directed behavior, perseverance, and spatial learning. Our findings will provide valuable
information relevant for mental disorders associated with dysfunction in these abilities including attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, depression, and addiction."
10795099,"ABSTRACT
Chronic short sleep (CSS) is common in developed countries and yet is likely to be a key modifier of
Alzheimer disease (AD), the most prevalent tauopathy in older adults. Sleep loss acutely increases tau
in humans and in mice, and we have recently shown that CSS hastens the temporal progression of
tauopathy in the P301S murine model of tauopathy, increasing all aspects of tauopathy, including soluble
tau oligomers, pathologic tau aggregation, gliosis, neuron loss and neurobehavioral impairment. The fact
that all aspects of tauopathy are impacted by sleep loss leads us to hypothesize that CSS targets a key
upstream initiating factor. Hippocampal calcium/calmodulin dependent kinase II (HC CAMKII) neurons
are among some of the most vulnerable neurons in AD and show early tau accumulation. We find that
CSS massively increases calcium transients in HC CAMKII neurons, activates CAMKII and calpain, and
induces uncompensated endoplasmic reticulum stress with loss of molecular chaperone BiP. Our overall
hypothesis is that CSS results in excessive intracellular calcium bursts in HC CAMKII neurons, leading
to sustained CAMKII and calpain activation, pathogenic tau modifications, and chronic uncompensated
endoplasmic reticulum stress with loss of BiP that feeds back positively to perpetuate injury. Here we
propose to critically test the role of each component of our working model in the biochemical, pathological
and behavioral aspects of tauopathy and CSS-hastening of tauopathy in the P301S model. In Aim 1, we
will test the role of CSS-increased calcium and calpain in HC CAMKII neurons in the CSS HC tau changes
by genetically suppressing local HC CAMKII calcium and calpain, while verifying suppressed calcium
transients with in vivo calcium imaging of CAMKII neurons. In Aim 2, using pharmacologic inhibition and
conditional HC transgenic knock down of CAMKII across CSS, we will determine to what role CAMKII
induces CSS-induced HC ER stress and CSS effects on tauopathy, and in Aim 3, we will critically test
the role of CSS-reduced BiP in the temporal progression of tauopathy and CSS effects on tauopathy.
Collectively, the proposed studies will identify important in vivo mechanisms by which CSS hastens the
temporal progression of tauopathy and will substantiate therapeutic avenues to lessen CSS exacerbation
of tauopathy and tauopathy progression in general."

The proposed project is a clinical trial to confirm the efficacy of a real-time fMRI neurofeedback intervention
that involves training adolescents with Tourette Syndrome to control a region of their supplementary motor area
(SMA) believed to be involved in tic generation. The intervention involves providing feedback on SMA activity
to participants while they practice regulating the region. They are cued to up-regulate and to down-regulate the
area at different times and encouraged to try mental strategies for both up-regulating and down-regulating that
have the potential to improve their symptoms. For up-regulation, this includes engaging in mental imagery of
complex motor activities, or doing mentally demanding cognitive tasks, in order to co-opt the relevant neural
circuitry for tasks other than tic generation. For down-regulation, this includes imagining relaxing scenarios that
tend to be associated with reduced stress levels and an associated reduction in tic severity. This intervention
was previously compared with a yoked sham control intervention in a small crossover design study that
yielded very promising results: large clinical effects were observed and the groups showed differences in their
ability to regulate the SMA during neurofeedback. Here we attempt to confirm that preliminary finding of
efficacy in a larger, purely randomized design that includes follow-up of participants, and critically, employs a
different form of control condition. In the proposed study, the control group will be trained via neurofeedback to
control a region of their visual association cortex that is believed to be unrelated to their symptoms. This
control region will be defined for each control subject in a manner that ensures it is not functionally connected
to their SMA. By using this new form of control condition, this study ensures that the intervention has been
tested against two of the most rigorous forms of control conditions used in clinical applications of real-time
fMRI neurofeedback (yoked sham and training on a control region). Given that the different types of control
conditions rule out different kinds of confounds, this is the most rigorous approach to testing this intervention: if
results are promising, they cannot be dismissed as an artifact of the kind of control condition used. In short,
with the proposed clinical trial, we aim to confirm the clinical efficacy of this new intervention, and to verify that
it is acting via the hypothesized mechanism of action (enhancement of control over the SMA via
neurofeedback). In addition, effects of the intervention on resting state functional connectivity patterns will be
examined to better inform our understanding of the network changes induced by the training."

The main goal of the Faculty Recruitment Core is to establish the necessary workforce to meet the mission of
PHSU of advancing the field in minority health and health disparities through competitive research. This goal will
be accomplished by recruiting highly competent research faculty in the targeted RCMI areas (Cancer
Biology/Oncology, Neurosciences, Infectious Diseases, Chronic Diseases, Human Genetics, and Data Science)
through the implementation of effective strategies and guidelines. These new faculty recruits must have the
necessary experience, potential, and expertise to secure mainstream funding from the NIH as other federal and
non-federal agencies. Furthermore, these faculty members are expected to significantly contribute and advance
in their respective disciplines through the development of highly visible peer-reviewed manuscripts and other
scholarly activities. The intention is to recruit a faculty member in FY1 and FY3 during the next five-year funding
cycle, 2024-2029. All positions will be open to National competition to recruit and retain the most promising and
talented investigators. We propose to target a pool of junior to mid-career faculty candidates with strong
professional credentials in our target areas. More importantly, these candidates must possess the necessary
expertise and experience to be competitive for mainstream funding (R-type of grants through NIH and other
mechanisms). The credentials of candidates will be assessed by a Faculty Recruitment Committee designated
by the corresponding Dean of each PHSU School, and approved by the Chancellor. Faculty Recruitment
Committees are comprised of faculty members from the different PHSU Schools (Medicine, Public Health, and
Behavioral & Brain Sciences) as well as key members of the staff. The committee evaluates the credentials of
the applicants, deliberates, and ranks the three top candidates. Candidates will be invited to PHSU for formal
interviews, and an employment offer will be issued indicating the duties of the position and an attractive
compensation package by the experience and training of the candidate. The recruitment package will contain
salary and fringe benefits according to the current salary policy, reallocation expenses , laboratory and office
space, accessibility to PHSU existing Core research facilities, and start-up research funds . These requested
RCMI funds will supplement the typical recruitment package offered by PHSU, for acquisition of key equipment,
research supplies, salary for a post-doctoral fellow or other key personnel, and specialized
consultants/collaborators, etc. Recruits will also benefit from the faculty development Core of this application.
After proper negotiations and acceptance of the terms, the selected candidates will be invited to initiate their
duties as regular employees of the institution. PHSU has recently developed policies intended to enhance the
retention of talented research faculty."

Despite significant efforts to reduce the burden of chronic physical and mental illness through treatment
advances and improved access to quality health care, health inequalities persist. Achieving better health
outcomes requires an integrated, patient-centered healthcare system, multisectoral engagement, community
organizing, social action, and reducing health inequities. Over the last few years, extensive evidence has shown
the benefits of active and equitable community participation in health research and promotion to address
problems related to social and structural inequities that significantly affect underserved populations. population.
Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) is recognized as a fundamental approach to improving
community health outcomes and reducing health inequalities. Based on CBPR principles, all CEC activities have
been designed, planned, and implemented with the active participation of trained community members
(community partners). In 2019, the PSHU-RCMI-CEC created and implemented the Community Training Institute
for Health Disparities (CTIHD), providing basic knowledge and skills in research and education to promote better
health outcomes community. The proposed project aims to expand training to members of underserved
communities in the southern and western regions of the island to increase research on health disparities and
community health promotion. Recognizing the importance of achieving partnerships between academic
researchers and community members, we will integrate junior investigators and community trainees in three
topics taught by the CTIHD (CBPR, Social Determinants of Health, Translational Research). Advancing in the
Community-engagement research continuum, we will establish the Community Research Engagement Office
(CREO), led by our community partners and CTHI alumni, to establish a sustainable communication channel
between the communities and academic researchers to respond to the needs of community health. Responding
to community-identified priorities, we will develop and implement a culturally appropriate strategic action plan
focused on mental health to identify risk factors, create educational strategies for prevention and early detection
of symptoms, and promote care services in community settings. The CEC will support PSHU-RCMI full/pilot
projects to translate their research and disseminate results to benefit communities. In addition, it lays the
groundwork for future collaborations of the PSHU-RCMI-CEC with the RCMI-CEC consortium to bring the

Despite the high rate of co-occurrence between substance use disorders (SUDs) and other mental illness the
neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie the stress/drug abuse comorbidity are not well understood. In
addition, some mental illnesses, such as anxiety, depression, trauma and stressor-related disorders, are
identified as risk factors for developing drug addiction. Studies have also shown gender-related health disparities
and health care disparities, with women having higher rates of comorbidity between SUDs and other mental
illnesses than men, but lower rates of treatment. Taken together, these studies highlight the need to recognize
how traumatic experiences affect neural responses to drug use in males and females. Research in our laboratory
combines validated rat models of severe stress and drug self-administration, which allow us to disentangle the
relationships between a history of stress and behavioral responses to cocaine. Preliminary results show that
inescapable footshocks (IFS) – a form of chronic stress - prior to cocaine self-administration (SA), decrease
cocaine consumption in female rats, but not in males. On the other hand, stressed-female rats show an increase
in cue reactivity after 30 days of forced abstinence, which is not observed in male rats. These results suggest
that chronic stress prior to cocaine exposure enhances the rewarding effects of cocaine during drug acquisition,
leading to increased craving incubation. Based on the need to understand the relationship between stress and
drug use, as well as these preliminary data, the goal of this study is to understand how a history of prior chronic
stress can influence behavioral and neurophysiological responses to cocaine in both males and females. Two
brain structures that contribute to the development of both severe stress and cocaine use disorders (CUD) are
the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, the effects of chronic stress and
cocaine exposure on synaptic plasticity of BLA neurons projecting to the NAc in males are still unclear and, in
females, completely unknown. Accordingly, we propose to specifically assess how IFS prior to extended access
cocaine self-administration differentially affects the neurophysiology of BLA neurons projecting to the NAc core
of females versus males, in connection with cocaine-related behaviors. We will utilize a chronic stress and CUD
comorbidity rodent model and whole cell patch-clamp recordings to measure synaptic plasticity in the NAc core
after self-administration (Aim 1), and BLA to NAc core synaptic changes after forced abstinence (Aim 2).
Additionally, a designer receptor exclusively activated by manipulations with designer drugs (DREADDs) will be
used to assess functional contributions of the BLA-NAc core circuitry during self-administration and cue reactivity
(Aim 3). Understanding how stress affects neural plasticity in a way that leads to increased cocaine-seeking
behavior in female rats, compared to males, is critical to model functionally relevant gender-specific
pharmacotherapeutic targets for mental illnesses (SRD) and SUD comorbidity treatments."

People with serious mental illness (PSMI, e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) die on average 20 years
earlier than the general population mostly due to preventable chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, obesity). Latinxs simultaneously account for higher rates of serious mental illness (SMI) and
chronic diseases compared to non-Latinx whites. Puerto Ricans are United States (US)-born citizens with one
of the highest rates of SMI and chronic disease risk and mortality among Latinxs in the US. These disparities
have been further aggravated after the healthcare system collapse in the aftermath of Hurricane María, the
2020 earthquakes in the Southwest region of Puerto Rico (PR) and the COVID-19 pandemic. Early
interventions on physical health parameters are urgently needed to reduce morbidity and premature mortality
among PSMI. Primary care physicians play a key role in these efforts.24 However, as the team has
demonstrated in their previous research in Puerto Rico, provider stigma towards SMI hinders prevention
efforts. Healthcare manager interventions (HMI) can be helpful to address these identified barriers and
support the use of existing services more efficiently by improving care coordination, patient activation and
chronic disease prevention. Despite its effectiveness, few HMI interventions are available for Latinxs with
SMI. As part of PHSU’s RCMI U54 renewal application (RFA- MD-22-002), the proposed Behavioral Project
aims to test Bridges to Better Health and Wellness (BRIDGES), developed by Dr. Cabassa (Co-I) 37 and
adapted by Dr. Rivera-Segarra (PI) at PHSU with RCMI support. BRIDGES is the only culturally adapted
Multilevel HMI for Latinxs with SMI. However, although culturally adapted, the effectiveness of BRIDGES
compared to treatment as usual group (TAU) in PR has not yet been examined. The proposed study aims to
address this important public health gap by deploying a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation
randomized controlled trial, useful for promising interventions for which effectiveness and implementation
have not been tested throughout (such as BRIDGES). In light of thus, the aims of this study are: 1) Test the
effectiveness of BRIDGES vs Treatment as Usual (TAU) and 2) Examine the implementation and public
health impact of BRIDGES."
10797612,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Puerto Rico, a United States (U.S.) territory, has the highest asthma rates globally, with 14.2 percent of its
residents affected at some point. They are more likely to be hospitalized and four times more likely to die from
severe asthma compared to any other group in the U.S. Asthma affects 334 million people worldwide, including
7 million children, and is a heterogenous obstructive airway disease, with severe cases accounting for over 50%
of its healthcare costs. Severe asthma is characterized by high levels of neutrophil infiltration leading to airway
inflammation. The persistent gaps in understanding the immune responses and molecular networks contributing
to severe asthma hinder the development of innovative and effective treatments. Usually, cellular inflammation
of the airways is driven by eosinophils or neutrophils. The study focus is the neutrophilic asthma subgroup, which
accounts for 20 – 30% of all cases. It is characterized by severe and persistent disease, frequent exacerbations,
and hospitalizations. Neutrophils play a crucial role in innate immune responses and inflammation through
phagocytosis, degranulation, the release of reactive oxygen species, and the release of neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs). Excessive NETs production without an infection leads to inflammation, cellular damage, and organ
failure. NETs formation has emerged as a crucial mechanism contributing to asthma pathogenesis via different
mechanisms. Thus, supporting the premise that targeting NETs production is a feasible therapeutic target for
severe asthma. Spleen Tyrosine Kinase (SYK) is essential for neutrophil activation and the production of NETs.
In neutrophilic animal models, SYK inhibition has improved outcomes and reduced airway inflammation.
Intriguingly, SYK has been shown to play a role in NETs release and to promote better outcomes in animal
models. The central hypothesis is that SYK signaling mediates NETs formation in severe asthma, contributing
to the disease’s pathogenesis. The proposed project is of utmost importance as it addresses a pressing and
relevant issue in asthma. By characterizing unique populations and conducting functional assays on primary
human neutrophils, we will gain new insights into the underlying mechanisms driving severe asthma. The
translational relevance of this study is that it will convey fundamental knowledge from human samples to support
future clinical trials examining SYK inhibition to complement and improve current asthma management. The
research program is based at the highly regarded Ponce Health Sciences University, a Puerto Rican academic
institution with a strong clinical research platform focused on addressing health disparities. The principal will be
led by two foremost experts in the field. Principal investigators of this study, Marcos J. Ramos-Benitez, PhD, and
Wilfredo De Jesús-Rojas, MD, FAAP, MSc, are experts renowned for their expertise in neutrophil biology and
clinical and translational pulmonary medicine, respectively. The research program is prepared to complete the
planned project on schedule and with the highest data quality and management. The team is well-suited and
equipped for recruiting individuals with chronic severe asthma and collecting biological samples and clinical data."

Investigator Development Cores (IDC), while often sparse in flair or innovation, serve a vital role in fostering the
career development, mentoring and project support to early-stage investigators (ESIs). The PHSU RCMI IDC
was initiated five years ago. In its first phase, STategic Academic Research Training or START, we used prior
lessons learned in our earlier pilot project program, to mold a more successful approach to this important function
of training and supporting the next generation of high impact health disparities researchers. Those lessons were:
1. need for uniform training that covered important topics often overlooked in professional degree programs; 2.
the realization that mentoring teams could address the breadth of expertise needed by our ESIs; and 3. extending
pilot projects from one year to two in duration. START implemented several innovative strategies in addressing
these three points. We were notably successful in several of these areas. The monthly training and professional
development seminars had a positive effect on developing professional skills (assessed by surveys). Our
extension of the pilot project program to 2 years resulted in improved productivity: six pilot project awardees and
8 pre-pilot awardees representing a total investment of $635,000 from 2019-2024, produced a return-on-
investment factor of 5.16 generating $3.28 million in extramural funds. Of the full cohort of ESIs trained under
START (18 Scholars), there were 44 unique publications in the period of 2019-2023. Five of the 18 were
promoted in academic rank. One area where we did note substantial room for improvement was in the mentoring
aim – whether due to the COVID pandemic or other reasons, our Scholars did not document regular interactions
with their mentoring teams, although nor did they express dissatisfaction (by survey). In the second phase, now
called Strategic Pipeline for Academic Research Career Success (SPARCS), we will implement innovation by
addressing lessons learned in the first phase. The first aim becomes the START monthly training program, which
will include the innovation of incorporating continuity. Prior Scholars we be recruited as some of the presenters
in the monthly seminars. In the second aim, we have expanded the use of an Individual Development Plan in
conjunction with the mentoring team, which now includes a SPARCS leader to assure accountability and
effectiveness of the mentee’s relationship with the team in achieving IDP goals. Other novel aspects to the
mentoring aim are inclusion of a peer mentor (ideally a former Scholar) and a more direct link to the Community
Engagement Core (CEC). CEC is training cohorts of community members in research methodologies that are
available for mentoring teams and as collaborators for SPARCS Scholars. Our pilot project and pre-pilot project
programs will be similarly implemented as we are expecting to achieve similar results (5.16-fold return-on-
investment). Thus SPARCS is a combination of tried and true and novel approaches."

Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health concern that impacts approximately 12% of the US population. Yet,
the majority of individuals with social anxiety do not receive treatment in large part because it is difficult to access
mental health resources. There is a need for targeted mechanism-focused interventions for social anxiety that
are also highly scalable. The PI developed a naturalistic paradigm to study social anxiety using simulated
teleconferencing interactions and demonstrated their utility for both eliciting social evaluative threat and testing
attention and audio vocal mechanisms. The PI then used these simulated teleconferencing interactions as the
basis of a new brief exposure-focused self-guided internet-based intervention called iExposure. The intervention
only required four sessions, completed over two weeks. The pilot study also tested two potential attention
mechanisms thought to maintain social anxiety, avoidance and attention control. Results were promising, with
the majority of participants completing the entire intervention and reporting medium-large decreases in
symptoms of social anxiety. Additionally, the attention augmentations appeared to enhance the efficacy of the
intervention. However, a larger study is needed to validate these results and to test potential mechanisms in
social anxiety. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test several mechanisms implicated in social anxiety
using the newly developed self-guided internet-based intervention called iExposure. Aim 1 will directly test two
different attention mechanisms implicated in social anxiety by augmenting iExposure with attention guidance or
attention control. Aim 2 will test the causal role of attentional processes in the intervention’s efficacy for reducing
social anxiety symptoms through mediation and moderation models. Aim 3 will test the role of engagement
(proportion of time spent speaking) as a causal factor in treatment outcomes and other audio vocal features
(pitch or amplitude) as potential predictors of treatment response. This project will provide graduate student
mentees experience with mechanism-focused research in the context of a clinical trial. Additionally, mentees will
learn a highly adaptable framework for conducting internet-based interventions for their own future mentored
research. Mentees will also gain advanced theoretical, technical, and statistical knowledge critical for conducting
eye movement (i.e., visual attention) and audio-vocal based research. This proposal will also offer mentees
opportunities to connect with the scientific community through conference presentations and journal publications,
as well as provide them with training opportunities in other labs. Findings will test potential targetable and
modifiable mechanisms maintaining social anxiety, in the context of a highly adaptable and scalable internet
intervention framework. Results may inform tailored treatments for individuals with social anxiety addressing
person-specific maintaining factors. Taken together, this project offers important advances in the training of
future clinical scientists and the development of targeted digital therapeutics for social anxiety."
10794950,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High-performance computational algorithms are essential to the analysis of large-scale biological sequence data
and have received broad attention. Developed several years or even more than a decade ago, many mainstream
software packages for sequence alignment, assembly and genome annotation do not take full advantage of
modern accurate long-read data or cannot keep up with the throughput of current technologies. The development
of advanced algorithms is critical to the applications of sequencing technologies in the near future. Based on our
work in the previous funding cycle, this project will address this pressing need with four proposals: (1) developing
an alignment algorithm for accurate long reads and high-quality assemblies for more comprehensive alignment
through highly repetitive regions and long segmental duplications; (2) extending our hifiasm assembler to the
high-quality assembly of more accurate Oxford Nanopore reads available nowadays; (3) combining our hifiasm
and dipasm algorithms for more accurate and more contiguous haplotype-resolved assembly without pedigree
data; (4) developing a protein-to-genome aligner to assist large-scale gene annotation of new species. Upon
completion, the proposed studies will result in high-performance user facing tools for sequence alignment and
assembly that are faster and more accurate than the current generation."

Project Summary:
Chronic HCV infection affects an estimated 3% of the world's population (>180 million people) and is a
worldwide health problem causing end-stage liver diseases including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The
development of HCV-related HCC occurs by advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis. The clinical outcome of HCV
infection and HCC risk depends on a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the severity of
liver inflammation. Our preliminary data show that exosomes released from HCV-infected hepatocytes contain
the immunoregulatory molecules such as TGF-β. Importantly, HCV exosmes derived from infected hepatocytes
promote intercellular communication with non-parenchymal cells such as Mφ and LSEC. As a result of
receiving signaling from HCV exosomes, Mφ and LSEC are differentiated into fibrotic cells, that activate stellate
cells and induce the development of liver fibrosis. The overall goal of this project is to define the mechanism by
which HCV-derived exosomes from infected hepatocytes drive pro-fibrotic liver microenvironment and explore
potential therapeutic agents to prevent liver fibrosis. In Aim 1, we propose to identify key molecular machinery
required for the secretion of hepatocyte exosomes after HCV infection in in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 2, we will
determine how HCV-derived exosomes induce the activation of fibrotic M2-like Mφ. In Aim 3, we will determine
how HCV-derived exosomes induce fibrotic LSEC differentiation and explore a therapeutic strategy for
preventing fibrosis. The studies proposed here will break new ground for identifying factors crucial for driving
pro-fibrotic liver microenvironment and will help to develop novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of liver
fibrosis.

10800518,"Docetaxel is the first-line chemotherapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (PCa), the major
cause of PCa mortality. Unfortunately, in most cases, PCa develops chemoresistance and continues
progressing, which has no cure. We developed a novel phenotypic screen and discovered bromocriptine, an
approved non-oncology drug, as a potent and selective inhibitor of chemoresistant PCa cells. In preliminary
studies, we demonstrated that bromocriptine effectively induced cell cycle arrest and cell death in
chemoresistant PCa cells via dopamine D2 receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In mouse
models, bromocriptine monotherapy was efficacious in suppressing the skeletal growth of chemoresistant
PCa. These exciting results support our hypothesis that bromocriptine is a novel and effective subtype-focused
precision therapy for chemoresistant PCa. Through this Research Project, we will investigate the mechanism
of action and preclinical efficacy of bromocriptine against chemoresistant PCa. Our main objective is to provide
solid preclinical evidence supporting bromocriptine as a safe, effective, and affordable care for chemoresistant
PCa. To do so, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanism of action of
bromocriptine in chemoresistant PCa cells and discover novel molecular targets of bromocriptine. In Aim 2, we
propose demonstrating that oral administration of bromocriptine is efficacious against chemoresistant PCa and
exhibits excellent safety profiles in preclinical models. With the successful accomplishment of this project,
bromocriptine will be well-positioned to be promptly repurposed as a safe, effective, and affordable
precision therapy for chemoresistant PCa subtypes. The impact of our research has significant public
health implications for improving PCa treatment, decreasing the mortality rate of PCa, and reducing PCa

Despite considerable advances in identifying genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in medulloblastoma, many
patients succumb to the disease. In addition, patients who respond to traditional therapy suffer from cognitive
and intellectual deficits. Therefore, there is a dire need to identify novel therapies for treating medulloblastoma.
Rho family GTPases are targets in multiple cancers including medulloblastoma. Rho, Rac1 and Cdc42 are
essential mediators of cell-cell adhesion and cellular motility signaling, which are dysregulated in
medulloblastoma. These GTPases are involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton, cell migration, cellular
proliferation, and developmental signaling. The small GTPase Rac1 has recently been reported as a possible
therapeutic target in medulloblastoma due to its regulation of Hedgehog signaling via the GLI1 and GLI2
transcription factors. We have recently reported that GLI1/GLI2 are in a novel complex that contains the
epigenetic regulators UHRF1 and DNMT1. Therefore, Rac1 may play a previously unappreciated role in
epigenetic regulation of medulloblastoma by controlling the GLI1/GLI2/UHRF1/DNMT1 complex. To test this, we
will utilize a novel brain penetrant Rac1 inhibitor we developed termed GYS32661. We will test the hypothesis
that GYS32661 will reduce GLI1/GLI2 nuclear localization, attenuate Shh signaling in medulloblastoma in vitro
(Aim 1) and reduce medulloblastoma growth in vivo (Aim 2). Collectively, our studies will test whether Rac1
inhibition is a novel therapeutic strategy for treating medulloblastoma."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major form of dementia, affecting about 55 millions of people worldwide. Despite
substantial efforts, we still do not understand its underlying mechanisms, and thus no reliable biomarker or
effective treatment has yet been developed. Protein N-glycosylation, the enzymatic process of adding N-
glycans (i.e., sugars) to proteins, is the most common post-translational modification that regulates the function
of most proteins. Aberrant N-glycosylation has been observed in key AD-related proteins such as APP, tau,
and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1). N-glycans are diverse structured biomolecules that play crucial
roles in various biological processes including brain development and signal transduction. Altered composition
and structure of N-glycans have been associated with AD and neuroinflammation. Thus, characterizing the N-
glycome (complete repertoire of all N-glycans in a biological sample) will facilitate the discovery of novel
biomarkers and shed light on the role of N-glycosylation in AD pathology. Our preliminary data show that
baseline serum N-glycans predicts AD onset and cognitive decline over time, and altered brain N-glycans are
associated with AD pathology. However, a comprehensive landscape of the peripheral and central N-glycome
in relation to AD is still lacking, especially in large-scale human populations. The mechanisms through which
aberrant N-glycome expression contributes to AD also remain an enigma. We hypothesize that dysregulated
serum N-glycome precedes and predicts AD onset, and aberrant brain N-glycome is causally implicated in AD
pathology. Our objectives are to understand the mechanisms through which aberrant N-glycosylation affects
AD and identify circulating glycan-based markers for early prediction and risk stratification. To achieve these,
we leverage the large collection of biospecimens (antemortem serum and paired postmortem brains) in two
community-based prospective cohorts of aging and dementia (ROS and MAP). We will use the high-resolution
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to
comprehensively profile the blood (serum) and brain N-glycome in relation to AD (Aims 1 and 2). The potential
causal role of aberrant N-glycome expression in AD pathology will be examined by integrative multi-omics
analyses, followed by functional validation in drosophila models of AD (Aim 3). In sum, this innovative project
leverages the wealth of deep clinical and neuropathological phenotypes as well as multi-omics data (e.g.,
glycomics, genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics) in the same brain cortex, and provides
unprecedented opportunities to uncover novel mechanisms underlying AD. Our proposal brings together an
exceptionally strong and unique multi-disciplinary team with complementary expertise needed to achieve our
goals. Findings of this study will significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms through which
aberrant N-glycosylation contributes to AD, and are likely to lead to novel mechanistic markers for early
prediction, risk stratification, and therapeutic targets towards precision treatment of AD."

Overweight and obesity directly contribute to cardiovascular risk factors for cardiometabolic multimorbidity (i.e.,
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, chronic kidney disease, and stroke) and can lead to the
development of cardiovascular disease independent of other cardiovascular risk factors. Recent projections
indicate that nearly half of all adults in the U.S. (48.9%) will be obese by 2030 and severe obesity will be the
most common body mass index (BMI) category among women, African Americans, and low-income adults.
Numerous reports have called for effective interventions for weight loss and weight management to slow and
ultimately reverse current trends. Evidence from leading scientific organizations suggests that advancing this
effort requires diversifying the biomedical research workforce with individuals from underrepresented groups
also most affected by the obesity epidemic. Increasing the size, skill, and diversity of the scientific workforce
calls for investment in training, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) answers this call with
its signature initiative – Programs to Increase Diversity among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related
Research (PRIDE). Our site, Obesity Health Disparities (OHD PRIDE) joined the NHLBI PRIDE family in 2014
and has implemented and evaluated a comprehensive research training and mentoring program for early-
career faculty and transitioning postdoctoral fellows underrepresented in biomedical sciences. OHD PRIDE is
the only funded site focused on obesity research and the only program specifically designed for eligible faculty
employed at or who were trained at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs). In this renewal proposal, we describe
our strategy for implementing and evaluating a refined evidence-based, culturally- and contextually driven
research training and mentoring program specifically designed for research-oriented, early-career faculty who
are employed and/or trained at MSIs. OHD PRIDE will consist of five phases: (1) an initial 10-day intensive
summer institute delivered in a phased, hybrid format; (2) longitudinal mentoring and networking during the
academic year, including Writing Accountability Groups (WAGs); (3) tailored mentor support to submit
competitive small research grant proposals (SRP); (4) a 3-day face-to-face mid-year meeting; and (5) a face-
to-face culminating summer institute that will emphasize completion of SRP manuscripts for journal
submission, career coaching, grant writing, and mock study sections. Our proposed program will draw from
lessons over the past nine years to continue training and mentoring in obesity health disparities research
across the life course, training in the responsible conduct of research, and secondary data analysis. OHD
PRIDE features a dedicated group of trained research mentors, career coaches, and researchers (many of
whom are faculty of color) with a strong track record of conducting a range of faculty development, research
training, and mentoring programs with diverse populations employed in MSIs and majority institutions."
10807636,"Antibodies are critical components of the adaptive immune system. While their simplest mechanism of action is
neutralization mediated by their hypervariable Fab domains, most of their functional effects are a result of their
constant Fc domains engaging host Fc receptors to recruit and stimulate the immune system. For IgG antibodies,
Fc domains engage Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) and complement C1q to induce antibody-mediated effector functions
that direct the immune response. A conserved N-linked glycan in the IgG Fc domain at residue Asn297 is
overwhelmingly the most important molecular determinant of Fc receptor binding and the induction of antibody-
mediated effector functions. IgG antibody glycosylation is: (1) heterogeneous – a range of glycan chemical
structures are appended to any given antibody and differentially glycosylated IgG antibodies, or glycoforms, each
bind with distinct affinities to Fc receptors to induce unique effector function signals in both substance and
strength; (2) commonly asymmetric – half or more of the IgG protein homodimers in a given antibody preparation
have chemically distinct glycans linked to the Asn297 residues on each of the two Fc protomers; and (3)
correlative to the time course and intensity of numerous diseases, including certain aspects of Alzheimer’s
Disease. Current, high-throughput methods to determine the glycosylation states of IgG antibodies rely on the
liberation of the glycans from the antibody protein. Thus, by these methods, it is impossible to determine which
IgG glycoforms, the immunologically-relevant molecules, and whether they are symmetrically or asymmetrically
glycosylated, exist in a mixture of antibodies; only the proportion of particular glycans in a sample can be
determined. IgG glycoforms, as intact heterogeneously and often asymmetrically glycosylated homodimeric
glycoproteins are the biologically-relevant molecule in the immune system. Accordingly, all information to date
correlating IgG glycosylation to disease and vaccine states is to glycan content in bulk. We have therefore
developed an approach to measure IgG antibody glycosylation using intact glycoprotein liquid chromatography-
mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) to quantify all IgG glycoforms, regardless of the content and symmetry of their
Asn297-linked glycans. We call our method WIgGWAM for Whole Immunoglobulin Glycoprofiling With
Asymmetric Monitoring and have demonstrated its proof-of-concept. We propose to decipher the glycosylation
code of Alzheimer’s Disease by applying our WIgGWAM workflow to cohorts of Alzheimer’s Disease patient
plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples and age-, gender- and race-matched healthy control subjects. We will
also further advance our technology to overcome remaining technical challenges in order to realize its full
implementation and broad utility. This work is significant because it will provide the first ever technological tool
for comprehensive, spatially faithful glycoprofiling of IgG antibodies; and for its application to Alzheimer’s Disease
patient samples. The studies are innovative in that they will leverage intact glycoprotein mass spectrometry
techniques in unprecedented ways in order to decipher the glycosylation code of Alzheimer’s Disease."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in patients aged 1-44 years. While there
is no treatment for TBI, one potential strategy is to harness the brain’s native capacity for cellular regeneration
to replace lost cells. NG2-glia, the largest population of regenerative cells in the adult CNS, can proliferate and
differentiate into multiple glial cell types; uncovering the molecular pathways regulating these NG2-glia
processes is a key step to develop future therapies for TBI. The candidate previously found that cortical NG2-
glia are regulated by the molecular circadian clock, a well-characterized 24-hr transcriptional-translational
feedback loop, with a key contribution by the clock gene Bmal1. However, the mechanism by which the clock
affects regenerative potential as well as the generalizability of this mechanism to other NG2-glia (e.g. white
matter NG2-glia) are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate hypothesizes that the NG2-glia endogenous
circadian clock directly governs molecular pathways to regulate regenerative potential, both in health and
disease. He will test this hypothesis with the following aims: 1) Determine the clock-dependence of cortical and
white matter NG2-glia proliferation and differentiation in the healthy brain and in response to TBI; 2) Identify the
clock-dependent molecular programs regulating cortical NG2-glia proliferation in the healthy and injured brain;
3) Define the differential expression of BMAL1 target genes during basal and injury-induced cortical NG2-glia
proliferation. Successful completion of these aims will identify the clock-dependent molecular pathways
underlying NG2-glia regenerative potential that will serve as future targets to manipulate post-TBI cellular
regeneration. Currently holding positions as Attending Physician in Critical Care Medicine at Children’s National
Hospital and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at George Washington University School of Medicine and Health
Sciences, the candidate is committed to a career in academic medicine. With >75% protected time, as supported
by his institution, the candidate will be guided by his primary mentor (Vittorio Gallo) and co-mentors (Kazue
Hashimoto-Torii, Amita Sehgal, Regina Armstrong). He has access to laboratory space, supplies, and research
funding to carry out the proposed project. His career development plan is comprised of hands-on training and
didactics to accomplish his training goals, which includes technical and non-technical skills necessary for future
independence. From a technical aspect, he seeks training in in vitro techniques, human post-mortem tissue
evaluation, and omics sciences; there is a focus on the last, as his proposal uses translatomics and chromatin
mapping, two approaches ideally suited for investigating the changes in NG2-glia molecular programs induced
by the transcription factors comprising the circadian clock. Completion of his training plan will permit the
candidate to conduct studies on a variety of scales, allowing him to fulfill the “bench to bedside” mantra that
motivates him to tread the path of a physician scientist. Furthermore, he will have positioned himself as an
investigator at a unique intersection of circadian rhythms, neurotrauma, and regenerative medicine."

My long-term career goal is to develop an independent research program focused on evaluation of novel

This K08 application describes a career development plan and research proposal that will provide me with
the requisite structured mentorship, coursework, hands-on clinical research experience and protected time

hypothesis that novel CD19-CAR T-cell approaches, including allogeneic platforms and/or
enhancement of autologous strategies, can overcome limitations of autologous CAR T-cell therapy
and improve patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, I will conduct a Phase I clinical trial (MEMCAR19;
NCT04881240) evaluating an allogeneic CD19-CAR T-cell product using donor memory T-cells to minimize
risk of graft-versus-host-disease (Aim 1). I will assess the in vivo characteristics of these CAR T cells through
intensive correlative studies conducted in conjunction with my collaborators, to further our understanding of
CAR T-cell biology and inform upon future therapeutic approaches (aka ‘reverse translation’; Aim 2).
Additionally, I will develop a new clinical trial evaluating a novel CAR T-cell product intended to induce
sustained remission through dual-antigen targeting (CD19/22) and enhanced CAR T-cell persistence
through epigenetic modifications (DNMT3A knockout) (entitled: PERSIST; Aim 3). Importantly, while this
research focuses on pediatric patients with relapsed and/or refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies, the
knowledge gained from this work will provide valuable insights into CAR T-cell biology that can be translated
to approaches for other high-risk malignancies. To support my transition to an independent investigator,
I have developed a robust mentorship and advisor team, with complimentary areas of expertise and
a strong track record of successful research and mentorship of junior investigators. My mentors,
advisors, and I have devised a comprehensive career development plan, which includes: i) acquisition of
formal training in clinical trial design, including coursework in biostatistics and a Masters in Clinical
Investigations, ii) expansion of my training in immunology through targeted workshops, and iii) advancement
of my leadership skills. The rigorous training provided by this award will prepare me for a career dedicated
to improving cellular therapies for pediatric patients with historically incurable diseases. Upon completion of
this K08 Award, I expect to have gained the necessary training in advanced clinical and transitional research
methods to support my transition to an independent investigator. Likewise, I expect to have generated
sufficient data to justify the development of additional cellular therapy studies through future clinical R01
applications."
10807267,"Project Summary
Mitochondrial energy production in the heart is crucial for proper cardiac function due to its high energy demand.
Cardiolipin is a phospholipid localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is necessary for mitochondrial
energy production via oxidative phosphorylation. Consisting of two head-groups and four acyl-chains, there are
tremendous numbers of molecular species of cardiolipin with varying acyl chain compositions. Among them, the
heart enriches linoleic acid (LA)-cardiolipin. It has been suggested that the cardiac form of cardiolipin may be
patho- and physiologically significant in cardiac function by facilitating energy production. Genetic disorders of
enzymes in cardiolipin metabolism with the reduced LA-cardiolipin in the heart are accompanied by
cardiomyopathy and mitochondrial dysfunction. Also, disturbed cardiolipin profiles are observed in several
cardiac failures. However, the importance of correct cardiolipin acylation is not fully understood.
 The goal of this study is to determine the mechanisms underlying the specific regulation of cardiac
cardiolipin by reconciling three hotly debated cardiolipin acylation theories: 1) LA-cardiolipin is dependent on an
enzyme Tafazzin that remodels cardiolipin with acquired preference for LA; 2) IMM protein environment controls
cardiolipin acylation, and; 3) tissue-specific lipid pools drive cardiolipin diversity. The contribution of each theory
needs to be determined in the context of cardiac specific LA-cardiolipin. Cardiomyocytes may draw from all three
to enrich LA-cardiolipin. I will test my central hypotheses that LA-cardiolipin optimizes cardiac bioenergetics and
that cardiomyocytes have an integrated system to generate and dominantly maintain LA-cardiolipin. I will
determine the significance/preference of LA-cardiolipin in cardiac energy production (Aim 1), characterize the
contributions of the cardiac IMM protein environment in LA-cardiolipin control (Aim 2), and identify the cardiac
LA-pool and pathway that concentrates LA in cardiolipin (Aim 3).
 This study will provide a fundamental understanding of a cardiac-specific mitochondrial lipid. Also,
characterizing this heart-specific system will expand our knowledge of basic cardiac biology and energy
metabolism. Performing this study in conjunction with the proposed career development plan, including solid
mentorship and training, as well as institutional support, will develop my research-related and professional skills.
This will enable my transition toward the achievement of my career goal to become an independent investigator
who conducts phospholipid studies with multi-directional skill sets and expertise."
10807399,"Osteopontin (OPN), a circulating protein with pleiotropic functions, is highly expressed in many cancers and is
known to have significant tumor-promoting activity. Thrombin cleaves OPN at arginine(Arg)153 and exposes a
previously cryptic α4β1 and α9β1 integrin-binding site at the new C-terminus in the N-terminal thrombin-cleaved
OPN fragment, OPN-Arg (OPN-R). OPN-R can be further processed to OPN-Leu (OPN-L). We have shown
elevated OPN-R and OPN-L levels in arthritis joint fluid, and cerebral spinal fluid in glioblastoma, demonstrating
that these cleavages occur in vivo. To define the role of thrombin cleavage of OPN in cancer biology, we created
a thrombin cleavage-resistant OPN-knock in (KI) mouse in which Arg153 is substituted with alanine. In a murine
B16 melanoma model, OPN-KI mice showed significant suppression of tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis.
Tumor suppression was eliminated in severely immune deficient NOG-OPN-KI mice and was abolished by
macrophage depletion in OPN-KI mice. Thrombin inhibition by the direct oral thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran,
replicated the B16 tumor suppression in wild type (WT) mice. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were
increased in tumors from OPN-KO and OPN-KI mice, with a switch from M2 macrophages to TAMs with a new
activation profile. We also showed suppression of murine ovarian tumor in the OPN-KI mouse. Thus, thrombin
cleavage of OPN initiates OPN’s tumor-promoting activity by suppressing the host-antitumor immune response
mediated by modulation of the TAMs. We hypothesize that an anti-OPN monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks
OPN cleavage by thrombin would be a novel adjunctive immuno-oncologic therapeutic that enhances the host-
antitumor immune response mediated by TAMs. We have generated rabbit mAbs targeting the thrombin
cleavage site of OPN that inhibit thrombin cleavage of human and mouse OPN. We converted the rabbit mAb
A6 to a chimeric murine/rabbit mAb, and showed that chimeric mAb A6 suppressed B16 tumor growth and
metastasis in WT mice, without any associated anticoagulant side effects, thus demonstrating proof-of-concept
that A6 can be a lead therapeutic candidate. A6 has been humanized, and mAb hA6v3 binds human and mouse
OPN and prevents thrombin cleavage of OPN. In collaboration with CIEA (Japan), we have created NOG-OPN-
KI and NOG-OPN-KO mice, and have reconstituted the NOGhIL3/GM-CSF mice with human cord blood CD34+
cells. We have also generated a series of mAbs against OPN-R, the OPN fragment that may play the key role
in suppressing the host-antitumor immune response. Anti-OPN-R mAb may be as effective as A6 with a major
advantage over A6 in that the circulating pool of OPN-R is much smaller than OPN, and therefore the drug
requirement as a therapeutic will be much less. We have identified a lead anti-OPN-R mAb C6r and it is a co-
lead for this translation project. Our goal is to convert the lead mAbs into a clinical candidate with the target of
filing an IND such that it will be an attractive drug candidate for out-licensing. Aim 1: Prove that inhibiting thrombin
cleavage of OPN with the lead humanized anti-OPN mAb hA6v3 improves cancer outcomes. Subaim 1.1:
Optimization of hA6v3 by determining its structure when bound to the immunogenic peptide. Subaim 1.2: Show
that hA6v3 reduces tumor growth in our humanized mouse cancer models. We will test hA6v3 on many human
cancer cell xenografts including melanoma, ovarian, and breast carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer.
hA6v3 will be given in the presence or absence of anti-PAD-L1 mAb to determine if they have an additive effect.
Subaim 1.3: Testing hA6v3 in human melanoma in humanized mice in combination with DTIC. Aim 2: To develop
a mAb against OPN-R as a co-lead to the anti-OPN mAb A6. Subaim 2.1: Test the efficacy of C6r in the mouse
B16 model. Subaim 2.2: If Subaim 2.1 is accomplished, C6r will be humanized and its efficacy in suppressing
human tumor growth and metastasis will be tested in our humanized mouse model as described for hA6v3. We
have extensively filed patent applications to protect the intellectual property in this project through the Stanford
University Office of Technology Licensing (OTL) with explicit participation by the VA."

In the decades ahead, demographic trends suggest that the sheer number of older
adults will increase, and they will make up a larger proportion of the overall population.
Many of these individuals will experience some type of neurological disease at some
point in their life. Consequently, we need an expanded cadre of scientists trained to
generate new knowledge about neurological conditions and aging. To address this
need, we will conduct an eight-week Summer Undergraduate Research Experience in
Aging and Neurologic Diseases at the Harvey A. Friedman Center for Aging at the
Institute for Public Health at Washington University. The program will 1) provide a
diverse group of undergraduate students with a closely mentored research laboratory
experience, combined with didactics and professional development sessions, and 2)
frame the research training in the context of aging and neurological disorders common
in later life. These goals address the need to nurture new researchers, diverse in their
backgrounds and experiences, to address the workforce shortage of scientists
investigating issues of an aging society.
Up to 10 undergraduate students each summer will be matched with an individual
faculty member whose research focuses on one of three neurological conditions (stroke,
Parkinson’s disease, or dementia) or who conducts research on interventions for
individuals with these conditions (e.g., home modifications, engagement in valued
activities). Students will also gather for weekly seminars that expose them to a
multidisciplinary perspective on aging, teach them research skills, and encourage their
professional growth and momentum toward further scholarship and training. With this
program we aim to engage trainees from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, which
reflects the diversity of the older adult population itself and the multidisciplinary
approach necessary to advance research on the prevention and treatment of neurologic
disorders."

 Methamphetamine (MA), a potent addictive psychostimulant, is highly prevalent in HIV-infected
individuals. Even for individuals with suppressive anti-retroviral therapy (ART), MA abuse has been linked to
increased viral load, accelerated disease progression, and higher mortality rates in people living with HIV
(PLWH). Despite well-documented evidence of MA's adverse effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and
cognitive function, its effects on immunity remain unclear. Further research is needed to determine the
molecular mechanisms of MA on the immune system, which could lead to targeted therapeutic interventions.
Previous reports and our studies showed that MA could impair mitochondria function and exacerbate
inflammasome activation and chronic inflammation during HIV infection. Autophagy, a homeostatic cellular
mechanism involved in disposal of damaged organelles and intracellularly pathogens, has been reported to
negatively regulate inflammasome activation. Our recent studies indicate that autophagy inducers such as
rapamycin can induce autophagy, improve mitochondria function, reduce inflammasome activation and chronic
inflammation in HIV infected humanized mice. We also observed improved anti-viral T cell immunity, reduced
viral reservoir and lower viral rebound after ART withdrawal in rapamycin treated mice, suggesting its
therapeutic potentials. In addition, we found that cannabis major components trans-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC) and cannabidiol(CBD) can potently induce autophagy and reduce inflammasome activation in stimulated
macrophages. Therefore, we hypothesize that inducing autophagy through rapamycin or THC/CBD may offer
therapeutic benefits in reducing inflammasome-mediated inflammation in both the periphery and CNS in
individuals with HIV infection and MA use. This, in turn, could enhance anti-viral immunity and decrease viral
reservoirs. We will study the following aims: 1) Determine the effects of methamphetamine on inflammasome
activation and T cell dysfunction during HIV infection with or without ART; 2) Examine the therapeutic potential
of targeting autophagy to reduce excessive inflammasome activation and restore T cell function during HIV
infection and methamphetamine abuse; 3) Investigate the effects of MA and autophagy induction on HIV-
associated CNS inflammation."

 Dysarthria is a neuromotor speech disorder that negatively impacts functional
communication and social participation for over 50% of children with cerebral palsy (CP).
Despite its prevalence among children with CP, little evidence exists to guide treatment of
dysarthria in children. Global speech modification strategies (e.g., using a loud voice or slow
rate) have shown promise for improving intelligibility in this population; however, children with
CP are heterogeneous in their communication skills and motor abilities, and they do not all
benefit from these strategies. The effectiveness of speech modification strategies for children
with CP is currently limited by a lack of research comparing the efficacy of different strategies
and a poor understanding of how these strategies lead to intelligibility gains. The proposed
research aims to address this need by comparing the efficacy of three speech modification
strategies, and by identifying the “key ingredients” underlying intelligibility gains across different
speech modification conditions. Specific Aim 1 will examine the effect of emphatic stress, a
novel, local speech modification strategy on intelligibility and speech naturalness for
adolescents with CP, compared to two global speech modification strategies (loud speech and
slow rate). We hypothesize that the emphatic stress strategy will yield equivalent or greater
intelligibility gains and higher naturalness ratings compared to the global loud and slow
strategies. Specific Aim 2 will identify quantitative speech measures that best predict within-child
changes in intelligibility across speaking conditions. We hypothesize that acoustic and kinematic
measures of articulation will better predict within-child intelligibility gains than acoustic measures
of task performance. The proposed research will provide information that has the potential to
lead to development of a novel, emphatic stress intervention strategy for children with
dysarthria. In addition, this research has important implications for improving theoretical
understanding of factors that directly contribute to speech intelligibility gains, and could be
leveraged to improve individualization of treatment techniques and maximize speech outcomes
for children with dysarthria secondary to CP."
10814199,"Project Summary/Abstract
Endoscopic surveillance of Barrett’s esophagus (BE) is recommended for early diagnosis and treatment of
neoplasia (i.e., esophageal adenocarcinoma and high-grade dysplasia). However, neoplasia is difficult to detect
on regular white-light endoscopy (WLE; sensitivity 64%), and 26% of neoplasia is missed with WLE alone. On
the other hand, confocal high-resolution microendoscopy (cHRME) is a low-cost, portable, reusable imaging
technology that provides microscopic “optical biopsy” images of the esophageal mucosa at the time of endoscopy
and has sensitivity of neoplasia detection upwards of 89% in the hands of experts. Despite these advantages,
the dissemination of cHRME is limited by the availability of expert microendoscopists capable of interpreting
these histopathology-like images. Artificial intelligence algorithms that automate interpretation of cHRME images
could bridge this gap by providing a real-time computer-assisted diagnosis to users in community-based BE
surveillance settings and reducing the need for expert review.
My objective is to develop and validate an automated software algorithm for real-time BE neoplasia detection
using cHRME. Furthermore, I will optimize the software algorithm by incorporating traditional clinical risk factors
for comprehensive risk stratification. Thus, I propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Technology
Development: To develop a software algorithm that automates interpretation of cHRME images in BE neoplasia
detection. Aim 2. Technology Evaluation and Optimization: (a) To validate the cHRME automated software
algorithm for real-time neoplasia detection in BE; (b) To optimize the automated software algorithm by integrating
demographic, lifestyle, and clinical risk factors for comprehensive BE neoplasia detection. Aim 3. Technology
Acceptability: (a) To evaluate the acceptability and experiences of endoscopists using computer-assisted
diagnosis; (b) To assess feasibility of the automated software algorithm in clinical BE neoplasia detection.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop artificial intelligence algorithms that facilitate dissemination
of novel, low-cost technologies into community settings for rapid, real-time, accurate neoplasia detection. Future
longitudinal studies will focus on validation of comprehensive risk models that use macroscopic and microscopic
metrics to predict future neoplasia risk in BE patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy.
My long-term goal is to become an independently funded investigator in novel techniques for early
gastrointestinal cancer detection. I have assembled an experienced mentoring committee comprised of senior,
funded investigators with expertise in technology development, artificial intelligence algorithms, epidemiology,
bioinformatics, and qualitative research. My career development plan includes additional formal research training
in artificial intelligence methodology, machine learning, and clinical trials. With the support and protected time
provided by the K23 Career Development Award, I will be able to complete my proposed research and career
development goals and generate preliminary data to be competitive for independent research funding."

Vaping is a serious public health concern that was associated with outbreaks of hospitalizations and deaths in
2019. These outbreaks of electronic vaping associated lung injury (EVALI) coincided with increased use of
electronic vaping devices by adolescents and young adults. The rapid disease onset of EVALI and the role of
macrophages in its progression, support a role for the innate immune system in the pathogenesis of EVALI.
Despite its rising use little is currently known about the effect of vaping on pulmonary immunology and physiology
highlighting the need for animal models to better understand its effects. Small animal models have shown
pathologic changes following exposure to vaping aerosols; however, they do not recapitulate the pathologic
manifestations of EVALI reported in humans necessitating a more translatable animal model to investigate the
pathogenesis of EVALI. Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are ideally suited for studying respiratory diseases in
humans due to their similarity in both pulmonary anatomy and immunology which provide advantages over other
animal models. Here, we aim to utilize a NHP model to investigate the impact of vaping aerosol exposure on
innate pulmonary defense mechanisms. We will longitudinally assess pulmonary and innate immune function
(immune cell infiltrates, alveolar macrophage phagocytosis, and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and
defense molecules) over a four-week period of daily vaping aerosol exposure. At the end of the study, correlation
with pathologic changes will occur through rigorous postmortem examination and sampling of the upper and
lower respiratory tract. The data generated from this study will inform on mechanisms by which vaping aerosols
effect innate pulmonary defenses, an important area of investigation in this time of highly infectious respiratory
diseases. Furthermore, this study will provide preliminary data for future investigations evaluating the contribution
of individual constituents within the vaping liquid (nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol, and vitamin E acetate); and
vaping in the context of comorbid conditions (SARS-CoV-2 and HIV/SIV), areas of special interest supported by
several funding agencies (NIDA, NHLBI, NIAID). This proposed study and Mentored Career Development Plan
will be conducted at the Tulane National Primate Research Center under the guidance of Drs. Ronald Veazey
and Chad Roy. The TNPRC has been a national resource and center of excellence for biomedical research
using nonhuman primates for over 50 years. The TNPRC has a strong commitment to training and mentorship
and provides support (financial and effort-based) to create a rich and diverse training environment for early-stage
investigators. The TNPRC fully supports Dr. Blair in his career goal to develop into an independently funded
private investigator working with NHP models to study diseases of major public health importance. The dedicated
time and additional mentorship provided by this K01 will help Dr. Blair refine his grant writing and project
management skills to ensure the success of his future R01 proposals."

Over 12 million people currently suffer from leishmaniasis, and ~2 million new cases occur each year, making it
a major global health problem and a WHO classified neglected tropical disease. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a
life-threatening form of the disease caused by Leishmania donovani and Leishmania infantum and is
characterized by parasite dissemination to the liver, spleen and bone marrow. Second to malaria, VL causes
most deaths amongst parasitic diseases. The majority of VL cases caused by L. donovani are reported from
East Africa, particularly Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan and Ethiopia. In Sudan, 40-50% of treated VL patients
develop post kala azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) which is characterized by proliferation of parasites in the
skin leading to macular or nodular dermal lesions. PKDL self-resolves in the majority, but up to 20% of cases
become chronic and non-healing. PKDL lesions have recently been implicated as a source of infection in sand
flies. VL in eastern Africa is an epidemiologically and clinically diverse disease. in In East Africa, two distinct
ecotypes of VL, the northern ecotype (NE-VL) in Northern Ethiopia and eastern Sudan and the southern ecotype
(SE-VL) in southern Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia, have been identified based on genetic differences
in parasites, and different sand fly vector species and ecological features. Phlebotomus martini (southern
ecotype) have a micro-ecological preference for termite mounds (breeding /resting site); and P. orientalis
(northern ecotype) depends on black cotton soil cracks. The disease phenotype and clinical outcomes also vary
between the two ecotypes and within the northern ecotype. For example, PKDL is common in NE-VL but rare in
SE-VL. Furthermore, although north Ethiopia and Sudan have genotypically similar parasites, PKDL is common
in Sudan but rare in north Ethiopia. Likewise, there are differences in the therapeutic response to paramomycin
and liposomal amphotericin as NE-VL responds poorly to treatment compared to SE-VL. Unlike Asia, VL in East
Africa is targeted for control rather than elimination by WHO, partly due to significant knowledge gaps in
ecoepidemiology, vector biology, and host and parasite factors driving transmission and pathogenesis. VL
transmission is influenced by intrinsic factors such as vector competence, longevity and gut microbiota, and
extrinsic factors including reservoir diversity, vector feeding preferences, and vector anthropophilicity, among
others. Yet, how these factors promote VL transmission in Eastern Africa and elsewhere is poorly understood.
To address these knowledge gaps, in this U01 project we propose to study the eco-epidemiology of VL at 4 sites
in East Africa which are endemic for SE-VL (2 sites) or NE-VL (2 sites) and have different ecological and
transmission features (Aim 1), determine the relative significance of factors that influence vector behavior and
ecology as drivers of transmission (Aim 2), and identify host and parasite determinants of pathogenesis in VL
and PKDL (Aim3). Collectively, our studies will contribute to VL knowledge landscape, control and
innovation opportunities and discovery of new treatments towards VL and PKDL elimination in East Africa."

specific focus on AHRQ/PCORI priorities. RDAC will synergize activities with the other E-STaR Cores to
achieve the goals of Learning Health Systems (LHS) to continuously generate and implement new evidence in
the context of clinical care. RDAC will act as a portal to help LHS scientists identify issues of shared
importance across key stakeholders in the health system – leadership, frontline providers, patients and
families, researchers, and the larger community. It will provide required access to real-world data derived in the
context of clinical care to both monitor improvement processes and support robust evaluation. Equity is the
embedded through-line of all Aims, by prioritizing projects targeting healthcare disparities, measurement of
outcomes by priority populations, and dissemination strategies that link findings back to representative groups
of patients and families served within our healthcare settings. RDAC will rely on the principle of co-production
of intervention, evaluation, and dissemination strategies to ensure creation of useful knowledge to achieve the
following Aims: Aim 1. To guide E-STaR Scholars' co-production project study design, leveraging EHR-
enabled tools and infrastructure. Co-production for Aim 1 requires Scholars to work with E-STaR
stakeholders to identify opportunities for knowledge generation in the context of health system initiatives.
RDAC targets problems and priority areas identified by the Administrative Core (AC), and supports Scholars to
utilize skills and mentorship (particularly for implementation science and Lean methodology) supported by the
Research Education Core (REC). Aim 2. To provide analytic support and oversight for E-STaR Scholar
projects, RDAC uses co-production to analyze and interpret results so that useful and generalizable
knowledge is generated. RDAC's LHS Oversight Committee will rely on priorities (and membership) drawn
from the AC, and leverage research, implementation science, and leadership training from REC. Aim 3. To
collect, categorize, and disseminate E-STaR Scholars' project's and overall program's findings. Co-
production will frame a repository that categorizes opportunities, solutions, and results from Scholars' work to
optimally facilitate dissemination and spread of knowledge within UCSF E-STaR sites and nationally.
Expected Outcomes of RDAC: RDAC will be the learning laboratory for E-STaR Scholars, and a hub of
generalizable knowledge for E-STaR stakeholders and beyond. RDAC will support at least 1 project per
Scholar (and ad hoc consultations for UCSF community LHS scientists), will monitor outcomes and record
project details (e.g., informatics tool chosen, target population, impact on clinical outcomes), and support an

10814303,"Sc histosomiasis is one of the world's most common neglected tropical diseases, currently infecting over 200
million people, with 90% of cases occurring in tropical Africa. The involvement of freshwater snails as vectors
imparts considerable stability to the schistosome life cycle because snails support the prolific production by
asexual reproduction of cercariae, the infective stage of the parasite for people. Efforts thus far to control
schistosomes in snails have had but limited success. Our work's overall goal is to identify innovative new ways to
interrupt the development and transmission of Schistosoma mansoni in its obligatory Biomphalaria snail hosts,
especially in the context of the Lake Victoria basin. Rather than to attempt to suppress large snail populations
across broad endemic areas, our approach is to find specific ways to target infected snails and the larval stages
of schistosomes living within them . Our field studies also constantly remind us of the impact a warming c limate
may have on vector snails and the schistosomes developing within them. Building on both lab- and field-based
discoveries made in our ongoing funding period, we propose the following new aims: Aim 1. We seek to learn if
immune responses we have shown to be relevant to resistance in a lab model, the Neotropical snail B. glabrata
and S. mansoni, are also at play in African Biomphalaria taxa in western Kenya. The transcriptomics and other
studies we propose will identify novel characteristics of the responses of African snails to schistosome infection
and how snail responses to S. mansoni might be affected by warming c limates. Aim 2. We aim to characterize the
means whereby larval trematodes, especially ubiquitously common cattle-transmitted amphistomes, suppress and
supplant the development of S. mansoni sporocysts in African Biomphalaria taxa . We will use a combination of in
vivo and in vitro approaches coupled with transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics techniques to address
this issue. Aim 3. We hypothesize that shore-dwelling B. sudanica suffers constant exposure to many different
trematode species, including S. mansoni, and have developed a generalist immune strategy featuring tolerance
to minimize trematode impact. In contrast, a close relative, B. choanomphala, lives in a deepwater refugium from
infection, and we predict will show diminished immune responsiveness and lack of tolerance responses upon
challenge with trematodes. Our aims all seek to characterize novel ways to interfere with the development of
schistosome larval development in snai ls, build a two-way bridge between lab and field studies and will enable us
to continue a 30+ year collaboration between biologists at UNM and the Kenya Medical Research Institute,
emphasizing training of young scientists in medical malacology.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Schistosomiasis is one of the world's most common neglected tropical diseases. Its resilience is partly due to the
reliance of schistosome parasites on freshwater snail vectors that support the production of prolific numbers of
human-infective cercariae. We propose to explo it immune resistance mechanisms in snails and the means
whereby competing larval trematodes interfere with larval schistosomes in snails to develop needed new means
to control transmission of schistosome parasites to people in sub-Saharan Africa.

Training Grants (T35) program. Again MSU-CVM and TUCVM propose to administer a Summer Research
Experience (SRE) Program to recruit and train veterinary students in biomedical research. Another important
goal of our program is to continue to increase diversity in the veterinary research workforce. Our program will
provide summer research experiences for 12 veterinary students each year that have completed their
freshman, sophomore, or junior year in an AVMA-accredited veterinary curriculum with 9 training positions at
MSU-CVM and 3 training positions at TUCVM. The proposed training will consist of a continuous 12-week
block of time in summer. The program will have three major components: 1) research conducted under the
mentorship of an active faculty researcher, 2) educational activities in research, career development, and
leadership, and 3) training and experience in preparation of scientific presentations. MSU-CVM and TUCVM
will take several steps to ensure the program is jointly operated: both Colleges will participate in selecting
trainees, educational activities will be jointly administered, and trainees will be assigned to MSU-CVM or
TUCVM based on individual research interests. We have operated successfully in this manner in the previous
funding period and propose to continue this collaboration in the next funding period, which this has been
facilitated by outstanding institutional support from both MSU-CVM and TUCVM. Our colleges have unique
research programs to give trainees experience in toxicology, epidemiology, translational research,
genomics/functional genomics, computational biology, infectious disease, oncology, and food safety. One of
the new initiatives we are proposing here are international SRE projects with shared mentorship between
MSU-CVM and African institutions. This will be beneficial for our students and will also enhance diversity in
biomedical research."
10812607,"The goal of this research is to characterize Ras-driven and KSR1-dependent mechanisms that modulate
tumor initiation, drug resistance and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in colorectal cancer. Tumor
initiating cells (TICs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells defined by their ability to self-renew and regenerate the
entire heterogeneous tumor population and are believed to be a reservoir of drug resistant persister cells. EMT-
like behavior contributes to tumor initiation, invasion, and metastasis. Partial reversal of EMT to a “hybrid” state
is necessary for efficient TIC formation and metastatic colonization. In turn, TICs lose clonogenicity and self-
renewal and acquire the invasive behavior of mesenchymal cells that drives their dissemination. While the
interconversion of tumor cells to migratory and invasive mesenchymal cells from self-renewing TICs is necessary
for metastasis, little is known about the mechanisms that direct tumor cells between these phenotypes. We
combined targeting of genes encoding key effectors of Ras signaling with polysome profiling and computational
analysis to discover that the molecular scaffold KSR1 mediates resistance to clinically approved drugs and regulates
TIC formation and EMT via RNA binding protein SRSF9. Our preliminary data suggest the hypothesis that KSR1-
dependent signaling in KRAS-mutated CRC promotes the splicing and translation of mRNAs critical to CRC
tumor initiation, drug resistance, and EMT. Using genetically modified CRC organoids, mouse models, and cells,
the synergistic expertise of our team will characterize these novel pathways controlling CRC behavior in vitro
and in vivo by 1) Characterizing the KSR1-dependent pathway(s) necessary for tumor initiation and resistance,
2) Defining the KSR1-dependent mechanism(s) driving cells from partial EMT toward invasive mesenchymal
behavior, and 3) Determining how KSR1-dependent splicing promotes translation of proteins critical for EMT.
Completion of this research will reveal novel mechanisms that may be targeted to improve therapeutic response
and inhibit tumor initiation and metastasis."

Molecular-scale interactions enable subcellular organization, but the current state-of-the-art does not include a
generalizable method for measuring how molecules move and cooperate on the nanometer scale and in real
time within the cell. This gap is particularly striking in bacteria cells. Accordingly, our picture of the organization
of the bacterial cell is incomplete. This proposal aims to understand how cellular components organize—by
scaffolding, aggregation, phase separation, or otherwise—to produce a general model of bacterial cell
organization and ultimately enable us to promote commensal bacteria or fight human disease. Thus, we aim to
measure the positioning, interactions, and motions of molecules in living bacterial cells in different protein
systems implicated in the sub-cellular organization of these cells. This proposal will develop these next-
generation super-resolution tools through three synergistic specific aims: (1) to super-resolve how single-
molecule dynamics vary in space and in time in living bacterial cells; (2) to super-resolve sub-cellular interactions
in space and time in living bacteria cells; and (3) to improve the detection of single molecules in living bacteria
cells. The toolkit that we develop to map molecular motions and interactions will be broadly applicable to the
single-molecule bacteriology community. Furthermore, by focusing on applications in bacterial cell biology, the
tools developed in this project will have a widespread, positive biomedical impact by making accessible long-
term, significant questions in microbial biology."
10814380,"Project Summary
Deregulated over-activation of ribosome biogenesis and protein translation is tightly linked to human cancers.
Thus, ribosome biogenesis must be tightly regulated during normal cell homeostasis. Of many regulatory
accessory factors, the nucleolar RNA exosome plays a key role in ribosome biogenesis. It contains a 9-subunit
core and a distributive 3ʹ to 5ʹ exonuclease called hRrp6 (human EXOSC10) and mediates the processing and
degradation of nucleolar RNAs including pre-ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and snoRNAs. Currently it is largely
unknown how the RNA exosome is regulated in the nucleolus. We recently found that USP36, a nucleolar
deubiquitinating enzyme (Dub), binds to the exosome through direct interaction with hRrp6. Interestingly,
USP36 does not regulate the levels of hRrp6 and other exosome subunits. Instead, it acts as a novel SUMO
E3 and mediates SUMOylation of hRrp6 at Lys (K) 583 in cells and in vitro. Knockdown of either USP36 or
hRrp6 impairs rRNA processing and significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Intriguingly, mutating K583
impaired the binding of hRrp6 to pre-rRNAs and the K583R mutant failed to rescue the rRNA processing
defects caused by knockdown of endogenous hRrp6, indicating that hRrp6 SUMOylation is critical for hRrp6
binding to and the processing of pre-rRNA. These preliminary data lead to a novel hypothesis that USP36
regulates the nucleolar RNA exosome by acting as a novel SUMO E3, thus being critical for pre-rRNA
processing and ribosome biogenesis and implicated in cancer. To gain further insight into the role of USP36 in
regulating the nucleolar RNA exosome and ribosome biogenesis, we will investigate the molecular and
biochemical mechanisms underlying USP36 association with the nucleolar RNA exosome and the
SUMOylation of hRrp6 in Aim 1, including how USP36 interacts with the nucleolar RNA exosome, whether it
SUMOylates other exosome subunits and adaptor proteins, and how USP36 acts as a SUMO E3 for exosome
and its adaptor proteins. We will then focus on the functional role of USP36 regulation of RNA exosome in
ribosome biogenesis in Aim 2, including the investigation of the role of USP36-exosome regulation in ribosome
biogenesis, translation, nuclear RNA quality control as well as cell growth and proliferation. As USP36 is
frequently overexpressed in human cancers including breast cancers, we will elucidate whether USP36's
SUMO E3 activity contributes to tumorigenesis in Aim 3, including the investigation of if USP36 and its SUMO
E3 contribute to cell transformation in culture and mammary tumorigenesis in vivo using transgenic mouse
models, whether deletion of USP36 suppresses tumor formation and growth using knockout mouse models
and whether inhibiting USP36 suppresses breast cancer cell proliferation and this inhibition correlates with the
levels of SUMOylation. Achieving these goals will provide critical insight into how USP36 properly regulates the
RNA exosome SUMOylation in the nucleolus, how deregulation of this activity contributes to tumorigenesis,
and would also reveal that USP36 SUMO E3 activity could be a therapeutic target."

Cancer is the leading cause of death for Latinos and Asian Americans, who are among the fastest growing
populations in the U.S. A large proportion of Latinos and Asian Americans live in ethnic enclaves—distinct
neighborhoods with high concentrations of individuals of the same ethnic origin (“co-ethnic residents”) that are
also characterized by recent immigration and linguistic isolation. The existing literature is mixed, with some
studies showing that ethnic enclave residence (vs. non-enclave residence) and foreign- (vs. U.S.-) birthplace
are associated with both better and/or worse outcomes across the cancer continuum. In this study, we will pool
cancer registry data across five states (CA, FL, NJ, NY, TX) comprising the majority of Latinos and Asian
Americans in the U.S. and link these data to contextual data characterizing the social, built and healthcare
environments. We will determine whether and how ethnic enclave residence and foreign-birthplace are
associated with three cancer outcomes (incidence, stage at diagnosis, survival) experienced by nine of the
largest Latino and Asian ethnic groups (Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean,
South Asian, Vietnamese) diagnosed with three cancer types (breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers).
Specifically, we aim to define and characterize ethnic enclaves, and examine cancer incidence by enclave
residence (Aim 1) and determine independent and joint associations of ethnic enclave residence and nativity
(foreign vs. US birthplace) on stage at diagnosis (Aim 2) as well as on mortality (Aim 3). With over 200,000
Latino and Asian American breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer cases, we will use multilevel models to
understand the impact of ethnic enclaves on cancer outcomes for these understudied populations. In doing so,
our study will accelerate discovery about the intersections between neighborhoods, ethnicity, nativity, and
cancer and will improve data and methods used by central cancer registries across the U.S. Findings have
potential to inform development of multilevel interventions to leverage enclave attributes that promote health
and to address any barriers to reduce disparities and improve outcomes for our fastest growing ethnic minority
and immigrant communities. We will disseminate our enclave measure and imputation procedures for missing
data to the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). In doing so, our methods will
improve completeness of cancer registry data for surveillance of the growing Latino and Asian American
populations. Our dissemination plan with collaboration from NAACCR leadership as well as the Offices of
Community Outreach and Engagement at NCI Designated Cancer Centers in five states will ensure 1)
methods are readily adopted by cancer registries and health disparities researchers across the nation; and 2)
findings inform community-engaged efforts to address multilevel cancer disparities among Latino and Asian
populations."

submitted on behalf of the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) requests 5 years of support for 3 predoctoral
and 4 postdoctoral (MD, PhD, MD/PhD) trainees. Program goals are to seek and prepare talented trainees for
research and/or leadership careers in academia, government, or industry by offering an integrated, inter-
disciplinary curriculum that emphasizes basic or clinical & translational science training in one of three major
substantive areas: (1) gastrointestinal mucosal biology & signaling, (2) gut microbiome, immunology & genetics,
and (3) hepatobiliary disorders. UMB entities represented by faculty mentors with robust federal funding
portfolios cut across schools, departments, and organized research centers and institutes to include the Schools
of Medicine (Departments of Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Epidemiology & Public Health, Microbiology &
Immunology, Biochemistry & Molecular Biology) and Pharmacy (Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences), the
Center for Vaccine Development & Global Health, and the Institute for Genome Sciences. Comprehensive
training opportunities allow predoctoral trainees to obtain PhD or MD/PhD degrees and postdoctoral trainees to
earn MS, MPH or PhD degrees. Under the supervision of expert mentors, this training program is designed to
enable trainees to develop hypotheses, design and perform basic or clinical research to test these hypotheses,
become expert in at least one substantive area relevant to digestive or liver diseases, develop oral and written
presentation skills, master the principles of responsible conduct of research, and prepare for transition to careers
focused on the study of the biology and pathobiology of the GI tract and hepatobiliary system. Basic and clinical
& translational science training in three focus areas (GI Mucosal Biology & Signaling; Gut Microbiome,
Immunology & Genetics; Hepatobiliary Disorders), is directed by accomplished, highly productive experienced
mentors who interact both within and amongst research tracks. Since its inception in 2005, this T32 program has
been highly successful; all training slots were consistently filled, trainee retention was 100%, and productivity as
measured by publications, awarding of advanced degrees, and career outcomes has been exceptional. All
predoctoral trainees who completed training qualified for the PhD degree and nearly all MD postdoctoral trainees
either have or will be awarded advanced degrees (MS, MPH, or PhD). This T32 program remains extraordinarily
diverse, fulfilling a societal need to redress underrepresentation in biomedical research and academia; two-thirds
of our trainees are women and one-fifth are Latino or African American. Former trainees obtained academic
faculty appointments or perform research for federal agencies (NIH and FDA) or industry, competed successfully
for federal funding, and attained leadership positions in academia. Notably, by attracting talented trainees and
investigators from other disciplines to basic and patient-centered digestive diseases and liver research, this T32
program adds great value to the UMB clinical, educational and scientific community."

Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of infectious disease deaths globally. With TB incidence
currently decreasing by 2% annually, achieving the World Health Organization’s ENDTB goal
of TB elimination by 2050 will require a substantial reworking of our TB control approach.
Previous elimination strategies for other diseases have only been successful once spatial
variation in disease incidence was identified and then locally relevant interventions
implemented. TB elimination strategies require longitudinal TB cohorts that incorporate
detailed spatial information. South Africa is an ideal setting for our work with both the second
highest TB incidence globally and a central National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS)
database of routinely-collected laboratory results. We propose to develop a ten-year national
TB cohort with the ability to track patients for up to ten years, including spatial location data
and HIV status, using national NHLS data. We hypothesize that NHLS data can be used to
identify key metrics in the TB care cascade, at the facility level, and evaluate the impact of HIV
treatment scale-up and the roll-out of new diagnostics on the TB epidemic in South Africa. In
aim 1a we will use probabilistic record linkage to create unique patient identifiers in the NHLS
data for all TB patients, allowing us to link an individual’s test results and track those confirmed
cases spatially and temporally, and incorporating HIV test results. In aim 1b, we will identify
key steps in the TB care cascade and augment our ten-year cohort with data from clinic chart
reviews. In aim 1c, we will identify locations with gaps in specific care cascade steps, common
patient movement patterns during TB treatment and identify locations with potential higher
burden of disease based on molecular test variables. In aim 2 we will quantify the relationship
between HIV treatment levels and TB incidence, at the facility level. In aim 3 we will evaluate
the association between GeneXpert Ultra “trace” results and repeat TB episodes to enhance
the interpretation of these new diagnostic results. This contribution is significant because it will
develop a national ten-year cohort of TB patients tracking them longitudinally and spatially
during treatment, enabling local public health professionals to develop locally appropriate
interventions to close gaps in the TB care cascade and understand the impact of interventions
and new TB diagnostics. The proposed work is innovative because it will provide the first
cohort of this kind in a high burden setting, with the longitudinal and spatial nature of these
data allowing for unprecedented capture of TB care and the impact of interventions. This will
allow policy makers to design locally-relevant interventions targeting specific gaps in TB care
and highly mobile populations, preventing further spread and ultimately reducing disease and
mortality due to TB. By using routinely collected laboratory data, our model adds minimal
financial costs and can be adapted for similar TB high-burden, middle-income settings with
large laboratory datasets."

Pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with an estimated 48,000
deaths in 2021. Prior work has identified several commonly occurring genetic alterations, including activating
KRAS mutations in approximately 95% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases and these
alterations are believed to be initiating lesions in the disease. Studies in inducible KRAS mouse models, as
well as in human cancer cell lines, indicate that KRAS is an important therapeutic target in this disease. Yet,
small molecule inhibitors of the most common KRAS mutants in PDAC are lacking. Therefore, other
therapeutic strategies that target critical downstream molecules are required. Prior published work from our
laboratory indicated that the kinase MTOR may be one such target. MTOR exists in two distinct signaling
complexes – MTORC1 and MTORC2. Genetic ablation of the essential MTORC2 component Rictor impaired
the development and progression of precursor PanIN lesions. Moreover, Rictor deletion extended survival in a
genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of invasive PDAC. These observations raise the question of
whether the inactivation of MTORC2 signaling in established invasive PDAC will impair their progression
and/or stimulate their regression. The published observations also indicate that a deeper understanding of the
signaling pathways regulated by the MTOR signaling complexes, and the resulting proteomic and gene
expression changes, is required to effectively target this axis and to predict potential resistance mechanisms.
This application therefore seeks to elucidate the roles of MTOR signaling in PDAC in vivo; to identify the
proteomic and gene expression changes induced downstream of MTOR; and to investigate the efficacy of
novel MTOR inhibitor-based combination therapeutic approaches.
To achieve these goals, three specific aims are proposed. Using elegant and novel dual recombinase mouse
models, studies in Aim 1 will investigate whether genetic inactivation of MTORC2 impairs the progression of
established PDAC in vivo. Using single cell RNA sequencing after the acute genetic inactivation of MTORC2,
the molecular consequences of impairing this signaling complex in vivo will be uncovered. The proposed
studies in Aim 2 will identify the gene expression and proteomic changes induced following the inhibition of
MTORC1, MTORC2 or both complexes in human PDAC cell lines. Computational integration of these datasets
will lead to the identification of critical pathways and transcription regulators, which will then be functionally
validated in human PDAC cell lines. Finally, studies in Aim 3 will interrogate the efficacy of novel combination
therapy strategies based on MTOR inhibitors in human tumor organoids and credentialed GEMMs.
The successful execution of the proposed studies will enhance the understanding of the role played by MTOR
signaling during pancreatic tumorigenesis and enhance our ability to effectively target this pathway for PDAC
therapy."

 The goal of this pilot and feasibility clinical trial is to acquire preliminary data regarding the safety and efficacy
of the non-invasive pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) therapy for pain management in interstitial
cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) patients. We present preliminary data suggesting that IC/BPS
comprises at least two distinct phenotypic subpopulations; one characterized as a bladder-centric disease
process and the other characterized as a non-bladder-centric systemic pain syndrome. We propose to leverage
our large patient database to recruit patients into this clinical trial wherein we will test the safety and efficacy of
PEMF therapy. The trial will employ a single-site, randomized, double-blind, sham placebo-controlled study
design. To accomplish the goals of this clinical trial, we propose the following three Specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of PEMF therapy on pain reduction in IC/BPS patients. From our
registry of 488 IC/BPS patients we will recruit 60 adult female patients who have met all inclusion/exclusion
criteria, that includes: (1) 30 patients with an anesthetic BC≤400 anesthetic (i.e., bladder centric phenotype), and
(2) 30 patients with an anesthetic BC>400 cc (i.e., those with a non-bladder centric (systemic) phenotype); all
having a current numeric rating scale (NRS) pain score of ≥6. Patients within each of the two phenotypic groups
will be randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to either the PEMF treatment or sham group, trained in the clinic on the use
of the PEMF device, and then undergo twice daily PEMF therapy (or sham) sessions at home for four weeks.
The sham device is identical in every way to the treatment devices except it does not deliver a pulsed
electromagnetic field. Patients will be assessed at enrollment, at follow-up after the 4-week treatment period,
and then monthly for the next 3 months. The primary outcome measure will be a significant change in their pelvic
pain score (i.e., a decrease ≥ 2). Secondary outcomes will be assessed by validated IC/BPS questionnaires
(O’Leary-Sant), voiding characteristics (voiding diary), Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form, Pelvic Pain and
Urgency/Frequency (PUF) Patient Symptom Scale, and Global Response Assessment (GRA).
Specific Aim 2: Determine the duration of benefit from PEMF therapy with and without maintenance
treatments. An additional cohort of 15 adult female patients with non-bladder centric IC/BPS will be recruited
and undergo the standard 4-week regimen, followed by a one-week-per-month of twice daily PEMF therapy
regimen for an additional 3 months. Primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed monthly, out to 4 months,
as described in Aim 1. The results will be compared to the non-bladder centric patients treated for 4 weeks only
in Aim 1. If results from Aim 1 show that there is no difference in the positive response between the two groups,
or that PEMF therapy benefits bladder-centric patients more than non-bladder centric patients, then the patient
make-up for Aim 2 will be adjusted accordingly (i.e., 8 patients from each group (N=16), or all 15 will be bladder-
centric, respectively) and the comparator group(s) will be adjusted accordingly."

Alcohol withdrawal (AW) after chronic alcohol exposure produces a series of symptoms. Among
them, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and impairments in cognition and emotion are the most
severe and dangerous symptoms. Despite alcohol’s aversive effects, alcohol’s positive-
reinforcing effects of euphoria, anxiolysis, and reduction in pain and seizures dramatically
increase the vulnerability to relapse and alcohol abuse. The severity and susceptibility to relapse
and perpetuation of alcohol abuse underscore the urgent need to understand mechanisms
underlying alcohol dependence and withdrawal in order to develop new therapeutic strategies to
intervene and treat AW-associated syndromes. In this application, we will test the novel
hypothesis that structural and functional changes in hippocampal newborn dentate granule cells
(DGCs) underlie the development and maintenance of AW-associated physiological and
psychological dysfunctions. DGCs are continuously produced and integrate into hippocampal
neural circuits, and this process has been implicated in seizures, as well as cognitive and
emotional function. The central goal of this proposal is to use novel, genetic methods for mapping
and understanding hippocampal neural circuits that are responsible for maladaptation during
alcohol exposure and withdrawal. In Aim 1, we will determine whether AW alters synaptic,
neuronal, and functional connectivity of DGCs by using structural, electrophysiological, and rabies
virus-mediated mapping methods. In Aim 2, to test the essential role of newborn DGCs in AW-
induced seizure expression, we will use a DREADD (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated
by Designer Drugs) method and produce models with gain-of-function and loss-of-function in
newborn DGCs. Using this method, we will assess whether specific activation and inhibition of
newborn DGCs will enhance and decrease AW seizures, respectively. In Aim 3, we will determine
whether altered activity of newborn DGCs is responsible for deficits in cognition and emotion
during abstinence. Our studies will unveil the essential function of hippocampal newborn DGCs
in AW syndromes at the level of neural circuits and provide a critical foundation for understanding
and treating AW-induced physiological and psychological dysfunctions."
10817898,"Obesity confers significant risk for developing numerous chronic disorders, such as insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. Importantly, many obese individuals are relatively resistant to developing these metabolic disorders, at least for a period of time. This implies that factors beyond BMI, per se, drive the development of these conditions. Clinical studies comparing the “metabolically healthy obese” to obese individuals with metabolic syndrome have revealed that the manner by which energy-storing white adipose tissue (WAT) remodels in obesity is a critical determinant of metabolic health. Healthy WAT expansion is characterized by 1) preferential expansion of subcutaneous WAT depots, and 2) adipose tissue expansion through an increase in cell differentiation, or “adipogenesis.” This phenotype correlates well with preserved insulin sensitivity in obesity. Pathologic WAT expansion is characterized by 1) limited expansion of subcutaneous WAT depots, and 2) pathologic WAT remodeling, characterized by limited adipogenesis, adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis. These phenotypes correlate with insulin resistance and ectopic lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues. As such, de novo adipogenesis in the setting of caloric excess is a protective mechanism to ensure safe energy storage in WAT and prevent against the development of metabolic disease. Understanding the mechanisms controlling adipogenesis in anatomically distinct regions in vivo remains a high priority in the field of adipose biology.  Adipocyte precursor cells (APCs) reside within the WAT vasculature as a subset of perivascular, PDGFRb+, mural cells. Adipogenesis originating from PDGFRb+ cells in the setting of caloric excess promotes healthy WAT remodeling and insulin sensitivity in mice. Importantly, strong inhibitory signals within the tissue  microenvironment control adipogenesis in a region-specific manner. During the next funding cycle, we propose to test the hypothesis that an anti-adipogenic, pro-fibrogenic, HIFa (hypoxia-inducible factor)-dependent signaling cascade suppresses PPARg activity in APCs through serine 112 (S112) phosphorylation to promote unhealthy WAT modeling in obesity. Our specific aims are to 1) determine the role of mural cell HIFa signaling in adipose tissue remodeling in obesity, and 2) identify HIFa-dependent signaling mechanisms leading to the inhibition of PPARg activity and suppression of adipocyte hyperplasia in obesity. Successful completion these aims will advance our understanding of depot-specific adipocyte progenitors and the regulation of adipogenesis in vivo. This may lead to novel therapeutics strategies to uncouple insulin resistance from obesity."

Colonic diverticulitis is a common (209 cases per 100,000 person-years) disease that is responsible for $5.5
billion dollars in health care expenditures annually. Diverticulitis is a leading indication for operations, hospital
admissions, and ambulatory visits, with a greater burden of disease in women. Postmenopausal age women
are at highest risk of developing diverticulitis when compared to either similar age premenopausal women or
similar age men. The reason for this disparity is unknown but may be due to metabolic changes associated
with menopause. Menopause is associated with the development of all components of metabolic syndrome
including visceral fat accumulation, atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension. While there
is compelling evidence that obesity increases diverticulitis risk, the mechanism for this association is unclear.
We believe metabolic syndrome explains this association. Establishing a role for metabolic syndrome in
diverticulitis risk would radically redefine this disease and open new lines of research to utilizing existing
therapies that are currently used for the treatment of metabolic syndrome. Menopausal hormone therapy does
not prevent postmenopausal metabolic dysfunction and is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
events, particularly in women with preexisting metabolic syndrome. In limited work, menopausal hormone
therapy use has also been associated with increased diverticulitis risk. Building on existing, high-quality
evidence and our own preliminary data, the proposed application aims to demonstrate that metabolic
syndrome and preclinical obesity biomarkers play a role in diverticulitis. Our central hypothesis is that
diverticulitis is a metabolic disease. We plan to test this hypothesis using a large, ongoing, prospective cohort
study (Sister Study) conducted by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. This mature cohort
of 50,884 women in the U.S. and Puerto Rico is well characterized with archived blood samples, sufficient
follow up to observe incident diverticulitis, standardized data collection, and detailed covariates including
reproductive characteristics. The aims of the proposed study are 1) to prospectively determine the association
between metabolic syndrome (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and central obesity) and incident
diverticulitis, 2) to prospectively determine the association between menopausal hormone therapy and incident
diverticulitis in postmenopausal women, and 3) to prospectively determine the association between obesity-
related serum biomarkers in relation to incident diverticulitis. This is a novel approach to diverticulitis that
diverges from the current paradigm and creates the potential for multiple new medical and behavioral
strategies for diverticulitis treatment and prevention. Understanding the association between menopausal
hormone therapy and incident diverticulitis creates the possibility of immediate change in prescribing hormone
therapy to women at increased risk and will generate important insights into the biological mechanisms
underlying diverticulitis."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10817798,"ABSTRACT
Efficient generation of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) requires the iodination of thyroglobulin (Tg), which is
synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and undergoes folding and trafficking to the thyroid follicle lumen
wherein iodination takes place. Endogenous T4 is 100% produced by thyrocytes, and the formation of T4 in Tg
has been conserved in evolution for ≥ 500 million years. To date, hundreds of different pathogenic mutations of
the TG gene have been found to cause congenital hypothyroidism in humans. Genetic hypothyroidism from
homozygous (or compound heterozygous) TG mutation is rare, but the frequency of a single pathogenic TG
allele in the human population is very common (≥ 1:200 individuals). All Tg mutants studied to date are misfolded
proteins trapped in the ER, causing ER stress. We recently reported that in untreated TG homozygotes,
endogenous thyroid hormone synthesis still occurs despite failure of Tg export from the ER. The mechanism
involves thyroid epithelial cell death, with extrusion of dead thyrocytes into the lumen of thyroid follicles, leading
to the disintegration and iodination of those cells in the follicle lumen. Massive expression of Tg protein in
thyrocytes, and the extremely high frequency of heterozygous TG mutations in the population, now leads us to
ask whether thyroid epithelial cell death may also be a (heretofore unsuspected) widespread feature
across individuals who are simple heterozygotes for mutant TG. This can be easily tested in animal models.
Additionally, in homozygous rdw/rdw (Tg-G2298R) rats, thyroid cell death has long been recognized as a factor
blocking goiter growth. Remarkably, we now find that in the congenital goiter mouse (cog/cog, Tg-L2263P), there
is also widespread thyroid cell death (that is nevertheless outpaced by thyroid growth). In the current proposal,
1) we have engineered a rdw/rdw knockin mouse and will directly compare cell growth and cell death to that
seen in cog/cog mice. 2) We will examine thyroid cell death in simple heterozygotes of these two models, which
have perfectly normal serum T4 levels but exhibit thyrocyte ER stress. 3) As heterozygous mutant Tg is misfolded
in the ER, it may be degraded at least in part by ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). We find that
defective ERAD of Tg leads to a thyroiditis with infiltration of inflammatory cells and follicle involuion. 4) Extrusion
of thyrocytes into the follicle lumen may expose non-apical portions of the cell to iodination by surrounding
follicular cells as a contributing mechanism of cytotoxicity. To test this, we will examine a TG-KO mouse model
in which TSH-stimulated overgrowth (and not ER stress) drives thyrocytes into the follicle lumen, exposing the
sensitive basolateral plasma membrane to the oxidative / iodination environment of the lumen, where it may
trigger thyroid cell death. In summary, all of the Aims of this proposal will highlight questions of ER stress-
dependent and independent mechanisms of thyrocyte death."

Significant improvement in the effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) now seems possible because of recent
exciting research results using ultra-high dose rates (UHDR), indicating that normal tissue damage can be
reduced (the `FLASH' effect), compared to conventional radiation for the same total dose. FLASH RT delivery
has shown reduced morphological and functional damage to normal tissues such as brain, colon, lung, and skin.
Although significant research remains, early indications are that the normal tissue sparing effect may as high
50% at some dose levels. If proven in translation, this effect would be the most significant improvement in RT
therapeutic ratio since the advent of treatment planning. While intriguing mechanisms for this result have been
postulated, they remain only well-reasoned speculations because of a lack of direct in vivo data on the physico-
chemical mechanisms including oxygen depletion and free radical species alterations. Dartmouth has created
the first reversible MeV FLASH beam on a clinically commissioned linac with >100 Gy/s at the patient treatment
bed, and prototyped an open-source treatment planning system, expanding research access. Additionally, the
team has invented unique technological capabilities to directly measure the highest dose rates and in vivo tissue
oxygen transients. The key technological barriers solved in the proposed research with preliminary data are: 1)
demonstration of conversion to a UHDR irradiator within a clinically commissioned linac, 2) verification of per-
pulse and per-fraction dose rates, 3) direct in vivo observation of oxygen transients, 4) direct measurements of
free radical species changes in vitro, and 5) access to functional tissue assays and genetic and proteomic
assays. Single-pulse and single-fraction dose rates will be quantified by high frame rate imaging. Additionally,
the in vivo oxygen changes will be quantified by two independent methods for co-validation, including electron
paramagnetic resonance oximetry and optical luminescence oximetry. Free radical species changes produced
from transient hypoxia will also be assessed through systematic in vitro analyses, and the potential linkages to
functional, proteomic and DNA damage examined. The FLASH beam conditions that minimize normal tissue
damage for a fixed dose will be established with this baseline data. The work is pre-clinical but can be readily
adapted to ongoing NIH sponsored spontaneous canine cancer studies has relevance to future large animal and
first-in-human translation. Multiple Dartmouth centers partnered to initiate and support this FLASH program.
Taken altogether, this bioengineering research project will advance the state of the art in high dose rate radiation
therapy using tools that have been uniquely developed by our 3 research groups, and the project results will
build the basic science needed to support proposed human translation of this ground-breaking field. The team
has leading expertise in radiation physics, in vivo molecular measurement, and radiation genetics and
immunomolecular biology and pathology. The work is supported by an External Advisory Board of international
expert FLASH consultants, as well as an internal Radiation Oncology Advisory Group."

Synaptic plasticity, the activity-dependent alteration in the strength of neuronal connections, forms the molecular
basis of learning, memory, and cognition. Both excitatory and inhibitory connections undergo bidirectional
synaptic plasticity to tune neuronal excitability, sculpt neural circuits, and coordinate the balance of excitation
and inhibition (E/I balance). GABAergic synaptic plasticity is crucial for maintaining E/I balance, and its
dysfunction is implicated in pathologies such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders.
However, inhibitory synaptic plasticity and its molecular underpinnings are critically understudied. A crucial
regulator of inhibitory synaptic plasticity is gephyrin, a synaptic scaffolding protein essential for GABAA receptor
clustering and inhibitory synaptic transmission. In one form of inhibitory synaptic plasticity, inhibitory long-term
potentiation (iLTP), gephyrin clustering increases rapidly at dendritic inhibitory synapses to strengthen
GABAergic synapses exclusively in dendrites by 20 min post-stimulation. Early mechanisms of iLTP are
independent of translation, but much less is known about iLTP persistence and how translation of key proteins
maintains iLTP. Answering these questions will provide insights into mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and how
changes in GABAergic synaptic strength shape neural circuits long-term. In this proposal, I will address this
knowledge gap by focusing on the role of gephyrin translation for maintaining iLTP and more specifically
where it occurs and how it is regulated to enact precise and persistent potentiation of inhibitory synaptic
connections. I hypothesize that local gephyrin translation supports iLTP exclusively in the dendrites and
that translational regulation of gephyrin influences gephyrin synaptic clustering and inhibitory synaptic
strength. I will utilize fluorescent in situ labeling of mRNA and visualization of actively translating proteins to
determine localization and translation of gephyrin transcripts in dendrites following iLTP (Aim 1). miR153 is a
short, non-coding transcript identified as a key regulator of gephyrin translation and implicated in learning,
memory, and cognition. By modulating its expression levels in neurons and employing a combination of
immunocytochemistry and electrophysiology, I will determine the impact of miR153 function on gephyrin
clustering and inhibitory synaptic strength during iLTP (Aim 2). Together, this approach will elucidate how the
localization and regulation of gephyrin translation impact specific and lasting changes to inhibitory synaptic
strength during iLTP and ultimately reveal the mechanisms driving inhibitory synaptic plasticity to maintain E/I
balance for proper neural function."

Gliomas comprise the most common form of brain cancer. In adults and children, high-grade gliomas are the
leading cause of brain cancer-related death, whereas the neurotoxicity associated with the treatment of pediatric
low-grade gliomas (LGGs) frequently results in long-term neurocognitive sequelae. For these reasons, there is
a pressing need to better define the mechanisms that underlie glioma development and progression relevant to
improving treatment and reducing lifelong neurotoxicity. This is especially important for children with the
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition who develop low-grade optic pathway gliomas (OPGs)
that impair vision. These NF1-OPGs form during early childhood (mean age, 4.5 years), where they are localized
to the optic nerve and/or chiasm containing the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) - the neuronal subtype
responsible for transmitting light-induced signals from the retina to the brain. Given the intimate relationship
between these tumors and the optic nerve, a collaborative venture between the Monje and Gutmann laboratories
resulted in the identification of a key regulatory role for neurons in NF1-OPG biology using authenticated
preclinical Nf1 optic glioma mouse strains that histologically resemble their human counterparts. In these studies,
we found that decreasing retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neuronal activity prior to tumor formation prevents OPG
initiation, while reduced RGC neuronal activity attenuates established OPG growth. In addition, Nf1 mutant
(similar to patients with NF1), but not wild-type (normal), optic nerves exhibit increased neuroligin-3 expression
and secretion in response to RGC activity, which is controlled by ADAM10 cleavage. Moreover, neuroligin-3
(Nlgn3) is a potent growth factor for Nf1-deficient OPG cells in vitro and genetic loss of neuroligin-3 in Nf1 optic
pathway glioma mice blocks tumor formation in vivo. Lastly, inhibition of neuroligin-3 shedding using ADAM10
inhibitors reduces Nf1-OPG growth. Based on these exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that Nf1 mutation
in RGC neurons promotes dysregulated neuroligin-3 signaling that drives the initiation and maintenance of Nf1
optic glioma. In this collaborative R01 proposal, we aim to elucidate the intersection between cell-intrinsic
vulnerability (NF1 tumor suppressor loss) and paracrine influences from neurons in the tumor microenvironment
relevant to understanding the pathogenesis of these common brain tumors in children with NF1."

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and fibromyalgia (FM) are highly comorbid, disabling and resistant to
treatment. More than half of MDD patients present with pain symptoms, and the comorbidity is associated with
reduced quality of life, poor pharmacological treatment outcomes, and opioid use disorders. New approaches to
help comorbid patients are urgently needed. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment may
ameliorate both pain and mood symptoms, possibly through modulation of shared underlying pathophysiological
brain networks.
Preliminary data indicate rTMS applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) significantly improved
both depressive and moderate pain symptoms but failed to improve more severe comorbid pain. In this
application, we propose to test the efficacy of a multi-target rTMS protocol that may be more successful in treating
both mood and pain symptoms in comorbid MDD/FM. This includes two complementary objectives: 1) to test the
effects of a novel rTMS protocol for comorbid MDD and FM, and 2) to provide critical additional training to the
candidate that will facilitate her transition into independence as a researcher specializing in the comorbidity of
mood disorders with chronic pain and their treatment with rTMS. This will be achieved through a randomized,
sham-controlled study with two experimental conditions: A) Active rTMS to lDLPFC (established target for MDD)
and sham rTMS to the primary motor cortex (M1, established pain target); and B) Active rTMS to both, lDLPFC
and M1. We anticipate that multi-site rTMS will be more efficacious to treat both MDD and FM symptoms than
the single site rTMS protocol. Additionally, we will determine the differences and similarities of neural signatures
of MDD and FM and how these interact in the comorbid condition using machine learning techniques.
The K01 project will take place at UCLA with the mentoring support from the director of the Neuromodulation
Division, two co-mentors and four other collaborators with expertise in rTMS, depression, chronic pain,
multimodal imaging, and machine learning analysis. This approach will achieve the project’s specific aims to: 1.
Evaluate the effect of multi-site vs. single site rTMS on clinical symptoms; 2. Determine the interaction of
networks affected in MDD and chronic pain and how they are modulated by rTMS; and 3. Examine the interaction
between analgesic and antidepressant effects of rTMS. If these aims are achieved, the short-term outcome of
this project will help determine the efficacy of multi-site rTMS for comorbid MDD and FM, identify the overlap of
the neural signature of MDD and FM and how it is modulated by rTMS, and characterize the relationship between
rTMS-induced antidepressant and analgesic effects. In the long-term, current rTMS procedures may be
significantly improved for the treatment of MDD with comorbid chronic pain."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) develops as a result of the stepwise acquisition of mutations ultimately
resulting in malignant transformation. Mutations that alter the epigenome occur early in disease
development, while mutations that activate signaling pathways occur later. I have developed an
experimental system in which mutation order can be directly manipulated in vivo. Using this system, I
demonstrate that mutations in the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA)
must occur prior to mutations in Colony Stimulating Factor 3 Receptor (CSF3R) in order for leukemia to
develop. In Aim 1, I will investigate whether the epigenetically similar core binding factor (CBF) AML also
demonstrates order dependence with co-occurring signaling mutations. I will also establish the
consequences of mutation order on the epigenetic landscape of developing hematopoietic progenitors.
In Aim 2, I will evaluate the role of lysine demethylase 1 as a driver of CSF3R/CEBPA mutant AML
through epigenetic profiling and loss of function studies. In Aim 3, I will identify novel therapeutic
approaches that reverse the epigenetic dysfunction seen in CEBPA/CBF AML and restore the
differentiation potential of AML blasts.
My goal is to become a successful independent investigator and a leader in the field of leukemia
genomics and targeted therapy. I will continue to conduct mentored research in the Laboratory of Dr.
Brian Druker, a pioneer in the field of targeted cancer therapy and Director of the Knight Cancer
Institute. I will undertake additional training in the area of cancer epigenetics and bioinformatic analysis
with the guidance of my mentorship committee members Dr. Lucia Carbone and Dr. Joshi Alumkal as
well as my and collaborator Dr. Hisham Mohammed. I will continue to see patients with hematologic
malignancy ½ day weekly in the outpatient setting with the remainder of my time dedicated to research.
Dr. Druker and my mentorship team will assist me in obtaining my first R01 grant and in navigating the
transition to running an independent research group."

Limited access to food and physical activity (PA) resources as well as poor social and economic neighborhood
conditions have been linked to low diet quality, physical inactivity, and elevated body mass index (BMI). Yet,
mixed findings may be due to gaps in understanding (1) the root causes of unequal allocation of such
neighborhood resources, and (2) the paths by which neighborhood conditions influence obesity. Root causes
such as housing policies have received little attention in obesity research and yet this may be critical to
addressing the epidemic. A key example is historical ‘redlining,’ where, between the 1930s and 1970s, areas
throughout the United States were designated as “high risk” based on the neighborhood’s racial composition.
Residents were systematically denied access to home purchasing. Poverty and segregation patterns in
redlined areas persisted; yet there is variation in the subsequent demographic shifts that have occurred.
Housing discrimination continues and may increase obesity disparities via heightened exposure to obesogenic
environments. We seek to address knowledge gaps by estimating longitudinal paths from historical and current
racially biased mortgage lending to BMI in a longitudinal cohort of Black and white adults. The project specific
aims are to: 1) Determine whether historically redlined neighborhoods have higher levels of obesogenic
neighborhood conditions and resident BMI through dietary behaviors and PA than non-redlined neighborhoods
(using baseline residential locations,1985–86); 2) Estimate longitudinal paths between changes in historically
redlined neighborhoods and BMI through changes in obesogenic neighborhood conditions, dietary behaviors,
and PA (using five timepoints of data, 1985–86, 1992–93, 2005–06, 2010–11, and 2015–16); and 3) Estimate
longitudinal paths between rates of current place- and race-based biased mortgage lending (data from 1990–
93, 2003–06, 2008–11, and 2013–2016) and changes in BMI, through changes in obesogenic neighborhood
conditions, dietary behaviors, PA, discrimination, and homeownership (data from 1985–86, 1992–93, 2005–06,
2010–11, and 2015–16). We achieve these objectives using the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
Adults Study (CARDIA) which is a longitudinal cohort with diet, PA, environmental, and sociodemographic data
collected for 5,115 white and black U.S. adults aged 18-30 years residing in four cities with redlining histories:
Birmingham, AL, Oakland, CA, Chicago, IL, and Minneapolis, MN. We will link historic redlining maps and two
indices of place- and race-based biased mortgage lending, using mortgage data, to CARDIA participants’
residential locations. We will estimate longitudinal paths from changes in residing in areas that were historically
redlined and areas with current biased mortgage lending to BMI changes through dynamic neighborhood
conditions, discrimination, homeownership, PA, and dietary behaviors. The results will deliver the needed
evidence to guide housing and neighborhood policy by understanding long-term effects of historical redlining
and current biased mortgage lending underlie neighborhood and obesity disparities."

Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect millions of Americans and have enormous impact on overall health and
mortality. In the past decade, opioid use disorders have emerged as a major health crisis throughout urban and
rural communities. The dissemination of knowledge and implementation of evidence-based practices remains
a challenge for achieving improved SUD-related health outcomes in the real world, particularly in rural areas.
Physicians are on the frontlines of identifying and treating patients with SUD, and are thus uniquely situated to
implement evidence-based care and identify areas for further research, yet there is a scarcity of addiction
medicine trained clinicians and physician-scientists who can advance the field. The University of Washington
(UW) School of Medicine is uniquely poised to develop an addictions research education program for medical
students. The medical school provides training to students across a 5-state region covering 25% of the nation's
landmass: Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI). We propose the following specific
aims: Aim #1 is to develop the Medical Student Addiction Research (MedStAR) Program within the UW
School of Medicine to provide opportunities for mentored research and training; Aim #2 is to encourage
medical students to consider careers in Addiction Medicine and research by establishing longitudinal
mentoring relationships and collaborative networks. We will train 6–8 medical students annually during a
9-week block that is dedicated to research between their 1st and 2nd years. To carry out their mentored
research project they will be paired with a primary research mentor, an Addiction Medicine trained clinical
mentor, and a research methods “coach.” Students in the program will also learn about Addiction Medicine
careers, including the option for Addiction Medicine fellowships, during their 9-week block. In addition, mentors
(research and clinical) will provide longitudinal mentoring throughout medical school through quarterly
meetings. A meeting of MedStAR students from all classes will be organized annually to facilitate the creation
of a network of students with common interests, and students will attend the annual College for Drug
Dependence conference where they can network with fellows and faculty from another R25 program (the
“Research in Addiction Medicine Scholars” program). Through the creation of the MedStAR program, we will
create a cadre of medical students who are poised to become the next generation of clinicians and scientists to
implement and disseminate evidence-based care for patients with SUDs."

Intracellular bacteria often secrete proteins (effectors) that hijack and rewire cellular pathways to establish their
replicative niche. Studying the mechanisms by which these bacterial proteins function have frequently led to the
identification of key cellular processes. Given that protein synthesis is essential to sustain cellular life and
function, several bacteria manipulate host cell protein synthesis. We recently discovered that the intracellular
bacterium, Legionella pneumophila (L.p.) secretes a eukaryotic-serine-threonine-protein-kinase (eSTPK)
effector called LegK4, that translocates into the host cell cytosol and phosphorylates the chaperone HSC70 on
T495 (pHSC70). Interestingly, this single phosphorylation causes a global block in protein synthesis. Often,
bacterial proteins mimic the activities of host proteins to usurp their cellular function. Given that HSC70 plays
diverse roles in the cell that includes the regulation of critical cellular processes such as protein homeostasis,
we studied whether a host kinase was capable of phosphorylating HSC70 on T495. Indeed, we discovered that
treatment of cells with methyl methanesulfonate, an alkylating agent that causes DNA damage, results in the
accumulation of pHSC70. Global mRNA translation is blocked during the DNA damage response (DDR) and it
is known that the type of stressor determines the mechanism of the block. For example, ionizing radiation and
topoisomerase II inhibition leads to an inhibition of mTOR signaling, while UV exposure leads to the
phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 by the kinase GCN2. However, the role of pHSC70 in inhibiting
protein synthesis during the DDR has never been studied. Here, we propose to investigate the role of pHSC70
in response to DNA damage and elucidate the mechanisms by which pHSC70 leads to protein synthesis
attenuation.
In the first aim, we will use biochemical and fluorescence-based assays to determine how phosphorylation of
HSC70 affects its chaperone function. In the second aim, we will perform polysome runoff assays to determine
which step of protein synthesis is blocked when HSC70 is phosphorylated. In addition, we propose to identify
the proteins that escape the protein synthesis block mediated by pHSC70. Finally, in the third aim, we will identify
the kinases that phosphorylate HSC70 during the DNA damage response and the spatio-temporal regulation of
signaling events that link the stress induced DNA damage response to pHSC70 and protein synthesis inhibition.
Overall, the aims of this proposal will help elucidate the role of a multifunctional chaperone in mediating protein
synthesis inhibition during DDR. The results of this study will not only be beneficial for the investigators studying
HSC70, but also those that study the DNA damage response and host-pathogen interactions."

Up to 10% of older adults experience durable postoperative cognitive decline at 1 year or beyond after major
noncardiac surgery, which is associated with up to 50% increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s
disease related dementias (AD/ADRD). However, most older adults will be cognitively unharmed by, and will
enjoy longer life and/or improved function because of, surgery. Very little information about anticipated
cognitive outcome is available to guide older adults considering elective surgery, because prior research has
not incorporated longitudinal pre-surgical trajectories, focused on clinically relevant cognitive outcomes, or
been designed to facilitate individualized predictions. Although it has been called “ethically imperative” that
physicians discuss adverse postoperative cognitive outcomes as part of surgical informed consent, they lack
accurate, individualized information to share with patients. In this study, we propose to use large, population-
representative, longitudinal data sources to develop and validate clinical prediction models for long-term
cognitive outcomes, including AD/ADRD, after elective major surgery in older adults. We will (AIM 1) use the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS), linked to Medicare billing data, to develop clinical prediction models
based on preoperatively-known factors to predict (a) memory, (b) risk of AD/ADRD, and (c) ability to
independently manage one’s finances and medication, two cognitively-intensive instrumental activities of daily
living (IADLs), at two years after surgery. Methodologically, we will balance model complexity with clinical
practicality and use methods to account for selective survival. We will (AIM 2) augment the clinical prediction
models with complications or adverse events that occur after surgery, e.g., delirium, hospital readmission, and
new moderate-severe pain. Findings from this Aim will enhance understanding of “best case, worst case”
cognitive outcomes (memory, AD/ADRD, and cognitive-functional) to include in preoperative cognitive risk
discussion. These findings will also support future hypotheses about key mechanisms that lead to adverse
outcomes, guiding priorities for post-surgical management to improve long-term cognitive outcomes. Finally,
we will (AIM 3) externally validate the HRS models using the National Health and Aging Trends study, again
linked to Medicare data, to assess generalizability of the models predicting memory, AD/ADRD, and IADL
independence after surgery. After validation, these models can be used clinically to predict 2-year cognitive
outcomes, including AD/ADRD risk, so that older adults have accurate, personalized information on the likely
cognitive outcomes with or without surgery. This information will enable inclusion of long-term cognitive
outcomes in surgical shared decision-making, a transformative advance for older surgical patients."
10820382,"PROJECT SUMMARY Nearly 14% of US households with children were food insecure before the start of the
COVID-19 crisis, and this number increased dramatically during the pandemic. Food insecurity (FI)—
inadequate access to enough food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy life—threatens
critical early childhood growth and can put children at risk for poor short- and long-term health. FI is also a
major source of inequity among children: compared to white households with children, Black households are 3
times as likely and Latinx households over twice as likely to experience FI. The degree to which household FI
impacts children’s diet and weight may vary depending on caregivers’ shielding behaviors (e.g., skipping meals
to prioritize feeding their children), characteristics of the neighborhoods where families live (e.g., healthy food
access), and participation in food assistance programs.
 The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is an important
evidence-based program that supports equitable child health by providing families with children aged 0–4
access to nutritionally and developmentally appropriate foods and counseling. However, only half of those who
are eligible for WIC participate; among those who do participate, nonredemption or partial redemption of the
monthly benefit is common. Maximizing the effectiveness of this cornerstone food assistance program requires
understanding the multilevel factors that influence families’ participation and use of the benefit.
 The goal of the proposed exploratory sequential mixed-methods study is to inform implementation of
WIC and other food assistance policies by analyzing how household FI is associated with weight trajectories
among young children, and how this association is modified by neighborhood environment and public food
assistance programs. We will accomplish this goal through the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Conduct in-depth qualitative focus groups with caregivers with low incomes to investigate families’ food
purchasing, feeding practices, and food insecurity during the COVID-19 crisis and economic recovery,
including recent changes in WIC and neighborhood characteristics.
Aim 2: Assess whether FI at age 2 to 36 months predicts weight gain trajectories to age 3 and 6 years before
and after onset of the COVID-19 crisis.
Aim 3: Assess interactions between FI and (focus group-identified) neighborhood environments in early life as
predictors of child weight gain trajectories to age 3 and 6 years before and after onset of the COVID-19 crisis.
 We will integrate qualitative and quantitative findings in an integrative report to inform WIC program
recommendations to best support families’ healthy feeding choices and children’s healthy growth in the context
of multilevel contributing factors. The evidence we produce can be used to improve WIC implementation to
support families with young children in metropolitan areas long-term and in times of crisis."

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the deadliest diseases. Based on the 2021 U.S. cancer statistics, the majority
of PC patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, either with distant metastasis (50%) or local invasion
(30%), resulting in a five-year survival rate of 3% and 13%, respectively. In most cases, particularly at the late
stages, PC is unresectable, non-permeable to drugs, immunologically suppressive, and highly metastatic.
Conventional therapies, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, are largely ineffective. Even the
advanced immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint therapy (ICT), can only achieve limited success, due
to the lack of T cells in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). We developed a localized
ablative immunotherapy (LAIT), which combines local photothermal therapy (PTT) and local administration
of immunostimulants. In our pre-clinical studies and preliminary clinical trials, LAIT has been shown to be able
to eliminate treated tumors and eradicate untreated distant metastases. Specifically, PTT destroys tumor cells
due to light absorption by the target tissue, leading to immunogenic cell death and the release of tumor antigens.
The locally administered immunostimulants, combined with released tumor antigens, induces tumor-specific
immune responses, particularly the infiltration, activation, and proliferation of T cells within the TME. However,
so far LAIT has been applied mostly in non-invasive mode for surface tumors, such as melanoma and breast
cancer. In this project, we will use interstitial LAIT (iLAIT) to treat orthotopic murine pancreatic tumors, in
combination with ICT. We hypothesize 1) iLAIT remodels the TME and induces antitumor immunity that
synergizes with ICT to improve therapeutic efficacy for PC; and 2) the mechanism of the novel iLAIT-ICT
combination involves a coordinated interplay between tumor cells and immune cells to overcome the
immunosuppressive TME. To test these hypotheses, we plan to achieve the following aims using two pancreatic
tumor models in mice: 1) to optimize iLAIT and to determine its efficacy in treating metastatic pancreatic tumors;
2) to determine the effects of iLAIT in reversing immunosuppressive TME and inducing systemic antitumor
responses in secondary immune organs; and 3) to determine the synergistic effects of iLAIT and ICT, specifically
the efficacy in treating pancreatic tumors and the induced tumor-specific, long-term immunity. This project has
high clinical relevance. The successful completion of this project will demonstrate the therapeutic efficacy of
iLAIT-ICT, paving the way for its clinical applications, with minor modifications (doses of ablation and
immunostimulation), for late-stage, metastatic PC patients, who face severely limited options. Furthermore, the
understanding of the iLAIT-ICT-regulated, spatiotemporally coordinated interplay between tumor cells and
immune cells can be used to design new therapeutic approaches for a variety of metastatic cancers in the future."

Hypothesis: Diseases of the pancreas are life-threatening, including pancreatic cancer (PDAC), affecting
exocrine cells, and autoimmune diabetes (T1D), destroying insulin-producing β cells. External factors like
infections and diet are implicated as triggers, but the disease origins remain elusive and cures are lacking. The
immune system strongly contributes to disease progression, but what governs pancreatic adaptive immune
tone is understudied, preventing effective immune-targeting therapy. Lymph nodes (LNs) are key sites for the
initiation of tissue specific adaptive immunity, and here we hypothesize that LN sharing between pancreas
and duodenum and liver influences the nature of pancreatic immunity. We postulate that both, the major
lymph output from these co-drained organs and their more direct exposure to environmental perturbation, allow
them to dictate LN environments, thus impacting pancreatic adaptive immune cell fate both during homeostasis
and upon intestinal or hepatic insults. Finally, we propose that migratory dendritic cells (DCs) presenting
pancreatic antigen are the key cellular target for such immune cross talk.
This hypothesis will be tested in our Specific Aims (SA): SA #1 will characterize the phenotype of
pancreatic antigen loaded DC and consequences for exocrine or endocrine pancreas specific T cell
polarization in the co-drained LNs during homeostasis. SA #2 will test to what extent LN DCs and T cell
fates change upon intestinal versus hepatic perturbation such as infections. SA #3 will assess the relative
importance of sharing LNs with liver versus gut for the T cell landscape back in the exocrine and endocrine
pancreatic tissue and, as a proof of principle, will investigate how duodenal infection, through LN sharing,
affects pancreatic tissue T cells and the progression of T1D.
Unique approach: 1. We will identify LN DCs loaded with pancreatic antigen by virtue of tracking tissue specific
antigen biotinylation or fluorescent protein uptake. 2. We have generated novel mice that permit expression of
the model antigen OVA from exocrine or endocrine pancreas, liver or gut, allowing for monitoring OVA specific
T cell fate. This method permits the systematic comparison of tissue-specific T cell responses in the LNs
shared with the liver versus the duodenum.
Impact: This project will provide fundamental insights into how pancreatic immunity may be shaped by
environmental fluctuations. While potential sources of pancreatic perturbation through LN sharing, liver and
duodenum could turn out as anatomical routes for therapeutic intervention in the pancreas. Mechanistically the
research will increase our understanding of DC imprinting in tissue versus LN and the impact of this “plasticity”
on dictating T cell responses. More broadly, the proposal features LN sharing between organs as a previously
unrecognized force shaping tissue specific immunity."

The goals of my research program are to elucidate fundamental mechanisms underlying synapse and
axon development and maintenance. We take multi-tiered approaches to investigate these processes,
primarily using C. elegans because this animal model is well suited for in vivo imaging with high cellular
resolution and because mechanistic dissection is within physiological relevant contexts and coupled
with functional impacts. We examine the C. elegans locomotor circuit, because we can unambiguously
observe the stereotyped patterns of synapses in all developmental stages, an essential readout to
assess how synapses are dynamically regulated. We have consistently developed innovative
technologies enabling visualization of organelles and subcellular structures in axons and synapses for
in vivo analyses of dynamic cellular processes. We were the first to visualize synapse remodeling of
juvenile motor circuit in living animals, which set two decades of vibrant research that have revealed
multiple pathways coordinating temporal events and spatial organization of synaptic connections. We
established C. elegans axon regeneration model, and have used large-scale genetic screens to
discover genes that promote or repress axon regrowth in adults. Many pathways have been found to
have conserved roles in axon regeneration in other animal models. In this R35 application, we will
focus on mechanisms underlying both the developmental synapse plasticity in locomotor circuit
maturation and maintenance, and also neuronal stress response and axon regeneration in adults. We
will investigate how neuronal activity pattern coordinates with transcriptional regulation by combining in
vivo imaging of synapse and calcium with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis over the entire period of
circuit remodeling. We will gain a deep understanding of molecular dynamics associated with synapse
and circuit plasticity. We have long-standing interest in the multifaceted roles of the conserved MAP3K
DLK proteins, which have been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes from synapse formation
and remodeling to axon regeneration and neurodegeneration. We will cross-examine mechanistic
conservation between C. elegans and mice. Membraneless compartments generated through protein
phase separation are now widely shown to play key roles in organizing cellular activities, including axon
regeneration. We will take a holistic approach to investigate protein phase separation with
physiological relevant expression and contexts, and also to model how genetic mutations in human
homologs may alter protein phase separation properties. Overall, the findings will advance our
knowledge on the cellular signaling network underlying normal brain function and will also provide
insights into pathological processes associated with synapse dysfunction and axonal damage."

chemical, biological, and toxicity data, to increase the scope & performance of advanced computational tools.
There is currently a strong value proposition in the $511B cosmetic industry, $218B agrochemical industry,
$221B home cleaning supplies industry, and $2T Consumer Goods markets for tools that ensure environmental
safety & expedite product design strategies by allowing researchers to rapidly leverage all available information.
 BioBricks-Env will solve this growing market challenge by providing a standard protocol supported by “bricks”
and an open-source tool set. Bricks are stand-alone digital resources that can be easily loaded into any data-
science environment. BioBricks-Env will leverage git & data-version-control to create “data-dependencies”, data
resources that can be imported into a data science environment using methods similar to package management
tools like Homebrew. However, BioBricks-Env will relieve developers of the significant effort and burden of
maintaining data pipelines, and if adopted, relieves data developers of the cost of maintaining a distribution
method. BioBricks thereby provides a service to data scientists, who can reduce the cost of project development,
and data distributors, who may struggle to find adoption due to the lack of an easy distribution method. This
service fills a strongly needed niche in the public health data marketplace. Revenue will be driven through two
sources including 1) Software as a Service models to toxicology researchers and laboratories and 2) strategic
partners who monetize their proprietary data on the BioBricks-Env platform.
 While the fully commercialized BioBricks-Env will integrate all features above, Phase I will target feasibility
for standardizable brick architecture, simplicity of deployment and use, interoperability of outputs, AI for data
sourcing, and prototype interface. Development will focus on public databases of high relevance to
environmental health and risk data. The Phase I BioBricks-Env prototype will provide a data-dependency
package manager that can run on windows, mac, and Linux and support common “Install”, “Update”, and “Load”
concepts. AI tools to support data integration and mapping will be expanded to support environmental data.
Once the prototype has been developed and tested in house, it will be evaluated in a usability and cost-
performance validation study with a commercial beta testing partner."

Oncogene targeted therapies offer a safe and effective approach to suppress cancer since these drugs spare
healthy tissues by selectively targeting driver mutations in cancer cells. Despite a strong initial response to these
therapies, however, patients eventually progress and relapse within months of treatment due to the survival of
residual tumor cells. These residual disease cells are crucial to eradicate since these cells often serve as the
reservoir for resistance and relapse. However, the biological and immunological properties of residual tumor
cells are poorly understood. We studied the immunological properties of residual cancer cells and the molecular
mechanisms governing it. Using a BRAF mutant mouse melanoma model, we found that residual cancer cells
that survive in vitro BRAF therapy exhibit immune evasion in vivo. Our preliminary data suggest residual tumor
cells evade the immune system by targeting macrophages of the immune system through upregulation of “don’t
eat me” markers such as CD47 (cluster of differentiation 47). Our findings are reproducible in human BRAF, ALK
and KRAS mutant cancer cell lines that all show CD47 upregulation upon treatment of respective targeted
therapies. Importantly, CD47 blockade has been shown to have an antitumor effect in many mouse tumor models
and is currently under investigation in clinical trials to determine its efficacy in human patients. Thus, our
preliminary data linking oncogene targeted therapies to CD47 upregulation has significant implications for
combining these therapies in clinical practice. To further investigate our findings, we propose a series of
integrative transcriptomics and functional genomics approaches to uncover potential mechanisms to target and
engineer the immune-mediated clearance of residual tumor cells."

Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep (HLBS) conditions such as heart failure, COPD, and pneumonia are among the
most common causes of hospitalizations. Many of such hospitalizations are thought to be avoidable with early
recognition and intervention. Today, patient-reported symptoms represent the primary means of detecting
impending hospitalizations, but because symptoms are late indicators of disease, this results in days to weeks
of delay in receiving care. We developed a non-contact adherence-independent longitudinal bed-sensing
platform to detect early physiologic signs of impending hospitalizations before patients recognize or self-report
symptoms. Preliminary results from our bed-based mechanical sensors suggest that the technology can learn
patient-specific baselines during clinical stability and can recognize excursions from baseline in the early
stages of developing illness. Here, we propose a milestone-based project aimed at collecting human training
datasets and developing generalizable models that can recognize impending hospitalizations in the home with
a focus on the underrepresented populations of San Diego and Imperial Valley counties. Doing so will
encourage utilization and adoption across HLBS disease verticals and patient subpopulations."

The 'Western diet' characterized by high fat feeding (HFF) is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD).
However, individuals who carry the AD risk gene APOE ε4 (E4) respond differently to high fat feeding (HFF) in
terms of several metabolic and cognitive responses. We present evidence that arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI
is an effective non-invasive method to evaluate acute changes in total and regional cerebral blood flow (∆CBF).
We will propose a clinical study in older adults involving ingestion of a high fat drink to test the prediction that
E4 carriers will show higher CBF in response to HFF compared to fasting, whereas E4 non-carriers will show
lower CBF. We will further examine regional differences in ∆CBF with emphasis on brain regions known to be
involved in AD pathogenesis, and we will conduct cognitive testing on all participants to explore relationships
between CBF and fluid measures of cognition. With this proposal we will also investigate whether peripheral
metabolic measures of glucose tolerance and body composition predict ∆CBF, and whether E4 status
influences those predictions. This intervention will be done in parallel with lipidomic and metabolomic analyses
of cerebrospinal fluid from an ongoing study of older adults after ingestion of a high fat meal with similar lipid
content to the high fat drink. With these studies we hope to gain a more in-depth understanding of how HFF
exerts influence on brain function and metabolism for E4 carriers and non-carriers, and identify brain regions
which are particularly vulnerable to the acute effects of HFF."

Sustained availability of efficacious drugs is essential for worldwide efforts to eradicate malaria. The emergence
and spread of drug resistance to current antimalarial therapies remains a pressing concern with reports of
artemisinin-based treatment failures escalating the need for novel antimalarial chemotherapies. Thus the
discovery of new druggable targets and pathways, including those that are critical for multiple life stages, is a
major challenge for the development of next-generation therapeutics.
Using an integrated chemogenomic approach, we have identified the cytoplasmic prolyl tRNA synthetase in
Plasmodium falciparum (PfcPRS) as the long-sought biochemical target of halofuginone. Furthermore, we
uncovered an unprecedented mechanism of drug-tolerance in the parasite by modulation of proline homeostasis.
In this proposal, we seek to understand the molecular basis of the parasite’s ability to sense and evolve
resistance to halofuginone via the Adaptive Proline Response (APR). We bring an integrated approach
combining our expertise in molecular parasitology, metabolomics, genetics, and synthetic chemistry to probe
these aspects of aminoacyl tRNA synthetase biology and inhibition in the parasite.
We will investigate a non-genetic mechanism of resistance to the PfcPRS inhibitor, halofuginone. We identify
the primary source of increased intracellular proline in response to halofuginone treatment and strategies
to circumvent this process.
We will determine if increased proline levels in parasites exhibiting the APR are mediated by changes in
key metabolic pathways at the genomic or proteomic level, using high-coverage DNA sequencing and
quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomic technologies.
We will explore APR-independent mechanisms of aaRS inhibition in the parasite, evaluating PRS inhibitors
with differing binding modes."

The morphological diversity among neurons is enormous and critical to their function, yet many gaps in our
knowledge remain concerning how this diversity is genetically encoded. As with vertebrate motor neurons, the
motor neurons of Drosophila melanogaster establish highly specific synapses on the correct muscle fibers in
the appendages and also elaborate highly stereotyped dendritic arbors in the central nervous system (CNS). In
the previous funding period, we characterized the individual progeny and transcription factor codes that govern
neuronal identities for one of the largest neuroblast lineages that give rise to motor neurons and neuropil glia.
We further described the role of Ig domain family members in establishing certain aspects of motor neuron
identities. Live imaging provided unprecedented access to the relevant stages of motor neuron maturation
during pupal stages.
In the coming funding period we will extend these findings to understand how transcription factors in post-
mitotic neurons regulate their target genes. We will carry out a series of whole genome and single cell studies
to obtain this information on a genome-wide scale. Finally, we will analyze additional members of the Ig
domain superfamily to assess what other roles, besides axon targeting, they play in motor neuron morphology
during development."

Our goal with this research training renewal application and the linked research proposal, submitted by our partners at the Cayetano Heredia University in Peru (UPCH), is to continue our activities as a research and training center for environmental health based in Lima, Peru, with links to Ecuador, Bolivia, and Chile. This application builds on a successful six-year NIH/Fogarty funded grant where we conducted environmental health research in Peru and built collaborative ties with academic and governmental partners. Our work in Peru has resulted in more than 20 publications and 200 trainees. We have maintained an exceptionally strong team of environmental health researchers from UPCH, Emory U, Johns Hopkins U, and Universidad de Chile (U. Chile). We have strengthened our collaborations with government agencies as the General Directorate of Environmental Health and Food Safety – DIGESA, the National Service of Meteorology and Hydrology - SENAHMI, The Ministry of the Environmental - MINAM, and the Ministry of Health – MINSA (see letters of support) We have developed a new relationship with a major Lima neurology clinic focused on Alzheimer’s disease and fronto-temporal dementia. Our multiple PI group, Drs. Gonzales and Hartinger at UPCH and Dr. William Checkley at JHU will take primarily responsibility for the research projects with the support of Dr. Steenland and others at Emory. Dr. Steenland will provide primary support for the work on Alzheimer’s disease and fronto-temporal dementia. We will include former and trainees as research assistants on the new U01 grant, working on the main projects of that grant, including the association of air pollution with cardiorespiratory disease, COVID-19, and Alzheimer’s disease and fronto-temporal dementia. The UPCH will coordinate all training activities in this proposal with the support of the team at U.Chile, who are well positioned leaders in the South American region. The training activities proposed will build on our prior work and will include: 1) funding for graduate programs (at the master and PhD levels) at the UPCH and with thesis mentors from Peru, US, and Chile 2) one-on-one mentoring to Peruvian investigators, and 3) short term courses in Peru, Chile, and the US focused on developing research skills relevant to our research activities, including our Alzheimer’s disease research project. Over the project period we anticipate short-term training for a minimum of 167 trainees, one-on-one training opportunities every year for 25 Peruvian investigators, master level training to 6 students, and PhD training for 3 students. All our training activities will include responsible conduct of research training adapted to the scientific context in Peru, and will include Peruvian faculty. We will evaluate our programs by determining whether our goals have been fulfilled during the grant period. We will coordinate our activities during annual hub meetings, and via email and virtual rooms as needed for the management of the activities."

 There has been extraordinary growth in new techniques to predict common, complex disease
based on polygenic risk scores (PRS). Without an understanding grounded in evidence, it is
unlikely that the clinical use of PRS will propagate from highly specialized applications and
environments to become adopted more broadly and provide greater benefit to the US
population. Critical challenges include: 1) understanding the impact of clinical PRS for multiple
diseases on long-term patient outcomes, 2) identifying risk thresholds for return of results that
optimize patient outcomes and provide cost-effective care, 3) understanding how PRS
performance across diverse populations may affect existing disparities and subsequent patient
outcomes. We propose to address these challenges using decision analytic modeling and by
building on our extensive work in this area to create a novel framework capable of assessing
PRSs in the context of monogenic and clinical risks. We have already created clinical-economic
models to project lifetime clinical impact and cost-effectiveness for population-level genomic
screening with return of monogenic disease risks associated with three CDC Tier 1 conditions:
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and familial hyperlipidemia. As part of
this proposal, titled Rational Integration of Polygenic Risk Scores (RIPS), we will create models
to assess the clinical outcomes and economic value of population screening using PRS in real-
world settings and applied to large and diverse populations. The Aims of the proposal include
1) to evaluate published and real-world evidence on the clinical value of adding PRS to inform
comprehensive genomic risk assessment; 2) to understand the impact of PRS performance
and return risk thresholds on incremental clinical benefit and cost effectiveness for breast
cancer, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and colorectal cancer, and 3) to develop
research priorities for the equitable development and implementation of PRS across
underserved and underrepresented populations."
10796867,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a devastating pediatric soft tissue cancer with morphological features of develop-
ing skeletal muscles. Although most patients with RMS achieve a complete remission, one third will develop
disease recurrence which is associated with a dismal clinical outcome. These clinical challenges underscore an
urgent need to identify patients at risk for resistance and develop better therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence.
Our pilot study revealed that rhabdomyosarcoma tumors have developmental intratumoral heterogeneity: differ-
ent cells in a single tumor harbor transcriptomic feature of different myogenic stages. Moreover, tumor cells with
developmentally immature characteristics are enriched in post-therapy specimens and have the potential to rep-
licate and reconstitute the entire developmental trajectory after therapy. In this application, we will develop com-
putational analysis methods to unambiguously identify immature tumor subpopulations in single cell RNA-seq
data and to reveal their master deregulated genes (Aim 1); In Aim 2, we will characterize the changes in those
transcriptional networks and cellular states during treatment in orthoptic patient derived xenograft models (O-
PDXs) in vivo. And in Aim 3, we will develop an innovative deep-learning data mining approach to evaluate the
prognostic significance of the myogenic transcriptional networks that underly RMS cellular heterogeneity in pa-
tient tumors. The proposed study integrates computational, statistical and experimental approaches to study the
role of immature cell populations in rhabdomyosarcoma recurrence. Building upon our computational expertise,
research experience in rhabdomyosarcoma, robust preliminary results and highly productive collaborations with
multi-disciplinary expertise in genomics/epigenomics, machine learning, Bayesian statistics and translational re-
search in rhabdomyosarcoma, we are in a unique position to achieve the goals of this research proposal. The
proposed research will be impactful because it will potentially change how we treat children with rhabdomyosar-
coma and the developed computational/statistical approaches will be broadly applicable to cancer research."

 This is a renewal application of an established NHLBI- sponsored T32, “Training Grant in Circadian and
Sleep Research”, to train predoctoral and postdoctoral students and fellows at Northwestern University. The
integration of circadian biology and sleep research has been the cornerstone of this Training Program from its
inception in 1998. Dr. Fred Turek will be one of the Program Directors of this T32 Program, which he has been
for 20 years. Dr. Phyllis Zee will also be one of the two Program Directors (Multiple PI), in order to provide
leadership for increasing clinical research training in Circadian Biology and Sleep Research for Fellows and
residents at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine (FSM) who will become leading
physician scientists as their careers develop. The T32 Program will involve 15 Primary Training Faculty who
have their primary appointments in either basic science or clinical departments. The proposed Training
Program will offer predoctoral and postdoctoral students interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary training in a wide
range of scientific disciplines that are highly relevant to understanding the function, regulation and health
implications of sleep and circadian rhythmicity. Central to this Program is the training of students in modern
basic science, translational research as well as patient oriented research. Multiple research perspectives have
fueled for more than 2 decades the productive interactions and cross-fertilization that have developed between
the preceptors in this Program. As our nation is facing unprecedented epidemics of obesity, diabetes and their
cardiovascular consequences, the Training Program proposed in the present application is uniquely positioned
to train an interdisciplinary workforce of academic and industry investigators, as well as government decision
makers, to address the roles of sleep disturbances and circadian dysfunction in these public health challenges.
A key feature of our Training Program is the inclusion of 7 Collaborating Faculty with additional clinical,
scientific and/or educational expertise that greatly enhances our training environment. Our Program will enable
trainees to integrate cutting edge approaches and techniques in the areas of genetics, genomics,
microbiomics, endocrinology, metabolism, pharmacology, neurobiology, pulmonology, cognitive neuroscience,
gerontology, and gastroenterology into their training in sleep and circadian research. Because the preceptors
are actively involved in research at the molecular, cellular, systems, behavioral, and epidemiological levels,
trainees will be trained in a rich environment of research activities that are integrated to study of the basic
mechanisms of sleep and circadian function at all levels of biological organization. We are requesting support
from this T32 renewal for 4 predoctoral students and 4 postdoctoral fellows for each of the five years. We
anticipate the training period will be 2-3 years for each student/fellow, although it may be less if a trainee
obtains individual support through other funding sources. It should be noted that the NU graduate school will
provide support for an additional 2 predoctoral students for each of the next 5 years of this Training Program."
10796978,"Project Summary
In 2018, nearly 67 million people in the US spoke a language other than English at home and, among them, 40%
met criteria for limited English proficiency (LEP). People with LEP are at higher risk of adverse events during
medical care. In fact, 1 in 12 patients is at risk for adverse events because of barriers created by language
discordance, which occurs when the patient and provider do not share a common spoken language. Surgical
disparities have been studied in various disciplines, but very few studies have focused on the impact of language.
Understanding the impact that language and language discordance or concordance have on surgical outcomes
represents a vital component of providing effective, high-quality patient care. Our overall objective is to improve
outcomes for surgical patients with LEP. The central hypothesis is that socioeconomic and sociodemographic
factors impact outcomes of surgical care for patients with LEP and that identifying those factors through
quantitative and qualitative research rooted in a social ecological model (SEM) will provide an opportunity to
design interventions that address these risk factors and reduce surgical disparities. Building on a deeper
understanding of patient experiences and social risk factors, this project will test the use of a mobile technology
for live medical interpretation provided directly to patients. We seek to determine if such a solution can improve
communication and promote patient-initiated language concordant encounters, thereby leading to better surgical
outcomes. While some research suggests the effects of language discordance may be mitigated by the use of
trained interpreters, qualified interpreters are not reliably used for all patients with LEP, even at resource-rich
health centers. These barriers threaten to compromise the provision of equitable and patient-centered care for
this patient population. To that extent, we will test our central hypothesis by pursing three specific aims: (1)
Determine whether language concordance is associated with surgical outcomes in a large retrospective surgical
patient cohort; (2) Identify the social factors that influence the use of formal interpreter services to treat primary
Spanish-speaking surgical patients with LEP; and (3) Evaluate if an immediate interpreter mobile application
enables language concordant communication for primary Spanish-speaking patients with LEP. Likewise,
studying the complex interaction of structural, interpersonal, and individual factors will enrich our understanding
of the impact of language across the continuum of surgical care. The research proposed in this application is
innovative because no one has sought to elucidate precisely how LEP may influence surgical outcomes and nor
have they applied the SEM in an attempt to have a profound impact for vulnerable populations. Also, by providing
the mobile interpretation application directly to patients (in addition to surgeons and nurses), we hope to empower
patients with LEP to serve as drivers of their care and improve the patient-centeredness of their care. Ultimately,
the findings of this study could be applied to other fields of medicine and patient populations to improve the care
of millions of patients by mitigating language and communication barriers to reduce health inequities."
10796981,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Metastasis is the main cause of death from solid tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC). Our long-term goal is to develop more selective therapeutic options to prevent or reduce the incidence of CRC metastasis by understanding how changes in fatty acid metabolism contribute to metastatic disease. 
Fatty acid synthase (FASN), a key enzyme of de novo lipid synthesis, is significantly upregulated and activated in CRC, and its activity is associated with poor prognosis, higher risk of disease recurrence, and death. We identified FASN as a potential target for advanced CRC and showed that upregulation of this enzyme is a key mechanism supporting metastasis in CRC. However, the underlying mechanisms of FASN regulation of metastasis and potential mechanism of resistance to FASN inhibition are not understood. The current application proposes a comprehensive research plan to study novel mechanisms of regulation of CRC metastasis by lipid metabolism. Our preliminary data suggest that the primary product of de novo fatty acid synthesis, palmitate, is selectively used for sphingolipid synthesis. Overexpression of FASN selectively regulates activity of SphK1 and SphK2 and increases the level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive sphingolipid implicated in metastasis. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that FASN enhances metastasis by upregulating the SphK/S1P axis and we will determine the contributions of SphK1 and SphK2 to CRC metastasis. Furthermore, our preliminary studies show a correlation between expression of FASN and CD36, a fatty acid translocase responsible for exogenous FA uptake. Our data show that inhibition of FASN leads to upregulation of CD36 and it can be a potential mechanism of resistance to novel FASN inhibitors that are currently being tested in Phase II clinical trials. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will elucidate how FASN regulates CD36 and determine molecular mechanisms by which upregulation of CD36 contributes to CRC metastasis including the effect of CD36 upregulation on sphingolipid metabolism and S1P synthesis. In Aim 3, we will test whether inhibition of FA uptake via CD36 will increase efficacy of a novel FASN inhibitor TVB-3664 in CRC. 
We will utilize biological samples from patients, human primary CRC cells, tumor organoids established from genetically modified mice and CRC metastasis models, which are the most advanced models for pre-clinical target and drug evaluations. These models will be used in conjunction with state-of-the-art approaches, including targeted and stable isotope-resolved metabolomics (SIRM), to evaluate the effect of alteration in lipid synthesis and FA uptake on cancer cell metabolism. These studies have a high translational impact since CD36 and FASN inhibitors are currently tested in multiple pre-clinical studies and Phase I-II clinical trials and there is urgent need for more research and knowledge on their effects in CRC. Beside validation of FASN, SphKs and CD36 as therapeutic targets in CRC, the comprehensive analysis of metabolic and signaling pathways proposed in the current application also have the potential to identify new druggable targets and therapeutic strategies for CRC."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in men in the US, primarily
due to the emergence of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Our long-term goal is to identify effective
drug targets and develop small molecule inhibitors for CRPC. Our objective here is to determine the potential
of LIMK2 kinase as a clinical target, and LI-11 (a highly potent and specific LIMK2 inhibitor) as a drug
candidate for enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. The central hypothesis is that LIMK2 is a disease-specific target
that is upregulated upon castration and promotes CRPC emergence, progression and enzalutamide resistance
via upregulation of AR, ARV7 and PI3K pathways. We show that LIMK2 is highly expressed in CRPC tissues,
but minimally expressed in normal prostates. Inducible knockdown or specific inhibition of LIMK2 fully reverses
CRPC tumorigenesis in vivo, strongly supporting LIMK2 as a potential clinical target. Equally importantly, LI-11
synergistically enhances the efficacy of enzalutamide in CRPC cells. At a molecular level, LI-11 simultaneously
depletes AR and ARV7, and inhibits PI3K signaling. Thus, LIMK2 targets three critical nodes driving CRPC
progression including enzalutamide-resistance in tandem. We propose the following three specific aims: (1)
Dissect the molecular mechanisms by which LIMK2 activates AR signaling in CRPC. (2) Investigate the
molecular mechanism of LIMK2-mediated activation of PI3K pathway in CRPC. (3) Determine the potential of
LIMK2 as a clinical target in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC and PDX models using LI-11 in vivo.
Innovation: LIMK2 is a potential clinical target for PCa. The hypothesis was formulated based on an innovative
chemical screen, which led to the discovery of several direct substrates of LIMK2. These LIMK2 substrates
unlocked a powerful mechanism for therapeutic targeting of AR, ARV7 and PI3K pathways in tandem in CRPC.
We have developed a highly potent and specific LIMK2 inhibitor (LI-11) that fully reverses tumorigenesis in vivo
with no detectable toxicity. LI-11 will be used for preclinical validation of LIMK2 as a therapeutic target in cells
and in vivo. LuCaP PDX models with variable LIMK2 levels will be used to determine whether LIMK2 levels
correlate with LI-11 and enzalutamide sensitivity in vivo. Several CRISPR engineered cell lines will be utilized
for genetic interrogation of LIMK2’s role in CRPC pathogenesis.
Significance: Successful completion of the proposed studies will provide a new strategy to simultaneously
inhibit three critical pathways via LIMK2, which lead to CRPC progression and enzalutamide-resistance. In vivo
studies will reveal the potential of LIMK2 as a clinical target and LI-11 as a candidate drug. PDX mouse models
with different LIMK2 levels will further uncover whether LIMK2 levels can serve as a novel predictive marker for
determining the efficacy of CRPC therapy. The data further indicate that targeting LIMK2 could prevent the
emergence of CRPC following androgen deprivation therapy. Finally, the validation of LIMK2 as a therapeutic
target in CRPC may improve the odds of treating other aggressive cancers, where LIMK2 is upregulated."

 Prostatitis is a common urinary tract problem for men. Although pathological and epidemiological
studies have linked prostatitis to the development of prostate cancer, its molecular mechanism remains
unclear. Answering this question will have clinical benefits in prostate cancer prevention and early intervention.
It has been proposed that inflammation can induce tissue stem cell expansion, thereby enlarging the cellular
pool for oncogenic transformation. In the prostate, epithelial basal cells serve as stem cells during
organogenesis and injury repair, but are quiescent in adult homeostasis. Preliminary data in mouse models
suggest that prostatitis reactivates adult basal cells to promote basal-to-luminal differentiation, which facilitates
the initiation and progression of prostate cancer. The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms
regulating basal cell plasticity in prostatitis and apply the knowledge for prostate cancer prevention. Our central
hypothesis is that dysregulation of the androgen receptor (AR) and Wnt signaling crosstalk through an increase
of Wnt/β-catenin activity and insufficient AR sequestration is a major factor underlying basal cell reactivation in
prostatitis. In three specific aims, we will use an integrated approach of mouse genetics, in vivo lineage tracing,
prostate organoid culture, ChIP-seq, biochemistry, single cell RNA-seq, and bioinformatics to determine the AR
and β-catenin cistromes in basal cells in prostatitis, characterize the inflammatory stromal environment
essential for the enhancement of basal Wnt activities, and assess the effectiveness of Wnt inhibition in
delaying prostatitis-stimulated cancer. This project will provide novel insights into the mechanistic link between
prostatitis and prostate cancer, a long-standing question in the field. The research outcomes will positively
impact human health since Wnt signaling is a druggable target and its inhibition is a potentially promising
treatment for ameliorating prostatitis-induced cancer progression."
10795672,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Background: Smoking rates remain disproportionally high in Chinese Americans, particularly among male
immigrants. In New York City, the current smoking rate among Chinese American men is significantly higher
than the general male population (28.2% vs. 17.5%). Foreign-born Chinese Americans are more likely to
smoke than their US-born counterparts. The persistently high smoking rate among Chinese Americans is
largely due to two factors: low intention to quit which might be attributed to Chinese immigrants' low health
literacy related to the harms of smoking and benefits of quitting, and persistent attachment to traditional
Chinese social norms that continue to support smoking in men. The other factor is the low utilization of the
existing available smoking cessation resources which might be explained by the lack of culturally adapted
cessation treatment services targeting Chinese Americans and their access barriers to the treatment services.
The fast growing use of social media represents an opportunity to overcome the access barriers to smoking
cessation treatment. WeChat, the most popular social media platform among Chinese globally, is fully
integrated into the daily lives of Chinese, and thereby has the potential to reach a wide audience of Chinese
immigrants and promote smoking cessation. Yet, no study has explored the use of WeChat to deliver culturally
adapted smoking cessation interventions targeting Chinese immigrant smokers.
Research: The goal of this study is to design and evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effect
of a WeChat-based multi-component smoking cessation intervention that is adapted to the cultural and social
context of Chinese immigrant smokers. The intervention will consist of four components, including a fully
automated bidirectional mobile messaging system (core of the intervention), infographics, narratives, and links
to existing cessation treatment services that target Chinese Americans. Focus groups will be conducted to
guide the adaptation of messages, infographics, and storytelling narratives. A single arm pilot test will be
conducted to examine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. A two-arm pilot randomized
controlled trial will be conducted to examine the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention.
Training: The training plan is built upon my research experience in tobacco control. I will receive training and
mentored research experience in social media health interventions, mixed methods, health disparities, clinical
trials and grant writing. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, formal coursework,
workshop, seminars, webinars, and attendance at conferences in areas of high relevance to this project."

To discover leads for next-generation chemoprotective antimalarial drugs, we tested >500,000 compounds
for their ability to inhibit liver-stage development of luciferase-expressing Plasmodium parasites (681 with
an IC50 < 1 µM). Cluster analysis identified potent and previously unreported scaffold families as well as
other series previously associated with chemoprophylaxis. Further testing through multiple phenotypic
assays that predict stage-specific and multispecies antimalarial activity revealed compound classes that
are likely to provide symptomatic relief from blood-stage and others that only prevent malaria. Target
identification using functional assays, in vitro evolution or metabolic profiling of the most potent blood
stage-active scaffolds revealed multiple mitochondrial inhibitors but also compounds with likely new
mechanisms of action. The total dataset provided hundreds of new chemotypes and scaffold families
(compounds sharing a core structure) that may be used in further drug development for the treatment and
prevention of malaria. Here we propose to perform hit to lead optimization on 1-2 scaffold families per
year, synthesizing approximately ~750 compounds. Select compounds (10%) will be tested for
microsomal stability, protein binding, hERG, and CYP inhibition. Pharmacokinetic and prophylactic animal
model testing will be performed on ~10 compounds per year. In addition, we will explore whether promising
leads can be converted to a prodrug form that can be given as intramuscular injection which provides long-
lasting chemoprevention. Hit to lead optimization will be accompanied by investigation into the mechanism

10798329,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nervous system function is highly dependent on the dynamic regulation of translation. Neural
circuit assembly requires translation in axons as growth cones navigate to their targets and
synaptic plasticity, the cellular basis of learning and memory, requires the activity-dependent
translation of synaptically localized mRNAs. Once thought of as ubiquitous adaptors, tRNAs are
emerging as key regulatory molecules in the dynamic regulation of translation. tRNA stability,
efficiency and fidelity are controlled by extensive posttranscriptional modification. In a recent
screen, we identified Drosophila tRNA methyltransferase 9-like (TRM9L) as a regulator of
synaptic growth and neurotransmitter release. TRM9L is one of two animal paralogs of yeast
TRM9, which methylates uridines in the wobble position of tRNA anticodon loops to modulate
tRNA interactions with cognate vs. wobble codons and regulate the dynamic translation of
stress response genes enriched for specific codons. Biochemical and genetic studies
demonstrate that the TRM9 paralog ALKBH8 methylate wobble uridines. In contrast, TRM9L
has remained biochemically uncharacterized in any system. With the generation of the first
TRM9L loss-of-function model, we have identified a role for TRM9L in modifying tRNA wobble
uridines in collaboration with the laboratory of Dragony Fu. Here, we propose experiments to
build on our findings to gain an integrated understanding of TRM9L's role in the nervous
system. In Aim 1, we combine genetic and imaging studies with biochemical analysis of tRNA
modification in informative genetic backgrounds to functionally dissect TRM9L's role at
synapses. In Aim 2, we will build on our finding that TRM9L also plays a conserved role in the
response to oxidative stress. Interestingly, a number of tRNA modifying enzymes have recently
been shown to play roles in both neurodevelopment and oxidative stress response, raising the
possibility of mechanistic links. To investigate the relationship between TRM9L's roles at
synapses and in oxidative stress resistance, we propose a comprehensive functional genetic
analysis. In Aim 3, we propose computational and proteomic approaches to identify neuronal
TRM9L target transcripts, followed by in vivo functional validation of top candidates. A growing
list of links between tRNA modifications and neurological disorders underlines the importance of
understanding the role of tRNA regulation in neuronal function. The proposed experiments will
generate fundamental insight into the role of TRM9L in the nervous system and significantly
expand our understanding of the dynamic regulation of protein expression and how its
dysregulation alters nervous system function."

10796686,"PROJECT SUMMARY (from parent grant)
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States.
Unfortunately, both genomic and transcriptomic analyses of PDA have failed to identify therapeutically relevant
targets. Combination chemotherapy remains the standard of care for the majority of patients who present with
locally advanced or metastatic disease, resulting in a median overall survival of less than one year. PDA has
been subclassified into 2-4 transcriptional subsets, which can be defined by their unique epigenetic states rather
than a specific genetic profile. Of these subsets, the quasi-mesenchymal (QM) subtype is characterized by the
worst prognosis, thus highlighting the importance of identifying new therapeutic avenues for QM PDA. The short-
term goals of this proposal are to elucidate the genetic or epigenetic mechanisms regulating QM PDA subtype
determination and to leverage that understanding toward the development of targeted therapies for QM disease.
Our preliminary data suggest PDA may downregulate a novel epigenetic regulator and tumor suppressor in PDA
in order to achieve this more aggressive QM PDA phenotype, while at the same time rendering tumor cells more
sensitive to specific targetable therapies. This epigenetic regulator, a histone deacetylase called sirtuin 6
(SIRT6), was recently shown to act as a potent tumor suppressor in genetically engineered mouse models
(GEMMs) of PDA, and inversely correlates with poor prognosis in patient samples. However, how SIRT6 is
downregulated in PDA and its role in regulating PDA subtypes remains unknown. Here we propose three
specific aims: (1) To identify novel mechanisms of SIRT6 downregulation in PDA; (2) To determine the
functional role of SIRT6 in regulating PDA subtypes; and (3) To develop novel therapeutic approaches for this
QM subset of PDA tumors. To accomplish these aims, we will apply a combination of cytogenetics, high-
throughput sequencing, genetic gain of function and loss of function approaches and pharmaceutical
interventions to a robust panel of molecularly characterized PDA GEMMs, human PDA cell lines and patient-
derived xenografts from the NCI Patient-Derived Models Repository. Our approach also takes advantage of an
innovative class of targeted therapeutics, which bind covalently to a specific residue on their target protein in
order to achieve greater inhibition and specificity. The long-term goal of our work is to transform the clinical
paradigm for this cancer from combination chemotherapy, toward a precision medicine-based approach utilizing
predictive biomarkers to tailor more effective and less toxic therapies for PDA patients."

Combining several functional units, termed domains, into a single polypeptide chain is a common
evolutionary strategy for creating biological complexity. The resulting multi-domain proteins are
prevalent in all proteomes and carry out essential cellular functions. However, the increased functional
complexity of these large proteins complicates their folding into native functional structures. In contrast
to many smaller proteins or individual domains, multi-domain proteins are prone to misfolding and
potentially cytotoxic aggregation. In the cell, several factors ensure efficient folding. Folding begins co-
translationally, while the ribosome still synthesizes the polypeptide. Molecular chaperones begin to
interact with the nascent multi-domain protein as soon as it emerges from the ribosome. Co-
translational folding and chaperone interactions are recognized as crucial for efficient multi-domain
protein folding. However, these processes remain poorly defined at the molecular level, because it is
technically challenging to study them. The goal of this project is to define principles of co-translational
folding and chaperone function to better understand how complex multi-domain proteins robustly reach
their functional structures. We are using a combination of single-molecule biophysics and live-cell
experiments to accomplish this goal. With optical tweezers, we are studying the folding pathways of
nascent multi-domain proteins at the single-molecule level. Manipulation of individual molecules is
ideally suited to resolve complex folding pathways of nascent proteins, elucidate the contributions of
the ribosome and molecular chaperones to the folding process, and determine how co-translational
folding and protein synthesis are coupled and regulated to ensure robust outcomes. These detailed in
vitro studies are complemented by experiments in live cells that detect co-translational folding events
in multi-domain proteins. Protein misfolding and aggregation, misregulation of protein synthesis and
decline of chaperone function are hallmarks of many aging-related diseases. Our studies may ultimately
provide a mechanistic basis for discovering novel therapeutic strategies to treat some of these
diseases."

The long-term goal of this proposed project is to develop an innovative, end-user informed Delivery
of Antiretrovirals via Implantable System for Young children (DAISY). DAISY will offer a combination of product
attributes that surpass existing oral regimens for antiretroviral treatment (ART) in young children (ages 2-5):
long-term ART (at least 6 months), reversibility during drug delivery, user independence, biodegradation, and
discretion of use. With a focus on preferred user characteristics in the Republic of South Africa (RSA), the
DAISY platform aims to extend time between clinic visits and simplify dosing regimens of antiretrovirals (ARVs)
in young children to ultimately improve adherence, and thus, viral suppression, disease progression, and
childhood development. The implant is uniquely retrievable, if needed, for the duration of ARV delivery, but
otherwise remains stationary and biodegrades after depletion of the drug. In this manner, reversal of drug
delivery is possible in the case of adverse reactions or need to change in the regimen. The implant technology
also decouples drug delivery characteristics from biodegradation properties and can achieve zero-order
kinetics of ARV release. The proposed specific aims directly address the goals of this National Institutes of
Health opportunity (RFA-AI-18-057) for innovative long-acting drug delivery systems for treatment of HIV-1
infected children. The specific aims are to (1) develop the DAISY product, including ARV formulations, implant
form factors, and characterization of biodegradation; (2) evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
down-selected DAISY prototypes during preclinical studies in New Zealand White rabbits and nonhuman
primates; and (3) inform technology development via iterative socio-behavior research with end-user
populations in RSA. Importantly, the proposed work will leverage achievements made during earlier programs
in developing the implant platform and will build on this work in the following key aspects: long-term delivery
(up to 6 months) of multiple ARVs and incorporation of end-user acceptability data from RSA into a Target
Product Profile. Our Research Strategy is milestone-driven, with clear expected deliverables guiding progress
of product development to align with future clinical translation."

Organ transplantation remains the best and most cost-effective clinical solution for end-stage organ failure;
however, it comes with the burden of lifelong immunosuppression (IS). Although effective in preventing allograft
rejection, immunosuppressive drugs have numerous side effects that negatively impact transplant recipients’
quality of life, including increased susceptibility to infections, increased cancer and heart disease incidence, and
potential kidney damage. Therefore, several preclinical and clinical studies have tested methods designed to
induce transplantation tolerance without lifelong IS. Still, the mechanisms of allograft tolerance are not fully
elucidated. Despite significant advances in the induction of tolerogenesis in classical preclinical models, these
models poorly recapitulate the immune responses in patients. Various innovative human organ-on-a-chip (OoC)
models mimicking in vivo organ structures and functions have been developed, but they have never been used
to model allograft rejection. Therefore, the overarching goal of this proposal is to develop a functional OoC
platform for studying the mechanisms of immune tolerance by modeling allograft rejection. Liver
transplants are more tolerated than transplantation of other solid organs and occasionally show spontaneous
tolerance, suggesting that it would be the ideal in vitro model to study tolerance. Modeling liver allograft rejection
on-a-chip requires a microfluidic device that mimics the physiological function of in vivo liver tissues, including a
microvasculature. The endothelium is a crucial determinant in allograft rejection mechanisms because the
donor’s endothelium is the first contact site with the recipient’s immune system. Despite recent OoC models
including microvasculatures, no vascularized liver-on-a-chip (vLoC) platforms
featuring perfusable organoids
have been established to study T cell extravasation, migration, and infiltration into primary liver organoids. To
bridge this gap, we propose to develop a functional vLoC platform that models T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR)
and antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR). The purpose is to demonstrate that not all HLA mismatches (MM)
and donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSA) are equally able to induce allograft rejection. First, we will
develop a microfluidic-based device in which
human liver organoids, blood-derived endothelial cells progenitors,
and fibroblasts embedded in fibrin will be co-cultured to generate vascularized and perfusable liver organoids.
Then, we will model allograft rejection by perfusing allogeneic T cells or anti-HLA antibodies through the vLoC
model. TCMR and ABMR markers will be assessed and correlated with
the different physicochemical
characteristics of HLA MM and DSA.
This novel platform can significantly impact transplant immunology research
while accelerating the understanding of transplant tolerance and increasing the translation of novel tolerance
induction protocols and regimens to the clinics."

Alcohol is a common potential source of DNA damage in humans. Indeed, its metabolic byproducts,
acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species (ROS), mutate hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Importantly, DNA
damage is central to the aging process by contributing to stem cell exhaustion, cellular senescence, inflammation,
and deregulated nutrient sensing. Together, these findings have led us to hypothesize that alcohol-induced DNA
damage accelerates aging in HSCs. Moreover, aged HSCs have myeloid-biased differentiation, reduced long-
term repopulating potential and decreased DNA repair function, which may lend themselves to being more
vulnerable to alcohol-induced DNA damage. Prior research has used very high doses of alcohol to study their
DNA-damaging effects on HSCs, which is difficult to generalize to the broader aging population who may enjoy
only moderate alcohol drinking. Also, the effects of moderate alcohol consumption on overall health in the general
population remain controversial. The overarching goal of this proposal is to shed light on the key aspects of HSC
aging using cell-based and animal models. We aim to identify DNA repair genes essential for repairing alcohol-
induced DNA damage in HSCs by a pooled CRISPR screen. We also aim to determine whether aged HSCs are
more vulnerable to moderate alcohol drinking using a mouse bone marrow transplant model and a single-cell
RNA-sequencing approach. Our proposed studies will reveal genes that repair DNA lesions caused by alcohol
and its toxic metabolic by-products. It will also inform us how aged HSCs respond differently to alcohol-induced
DNA damage than younger HSCs. Identification of key differences in DNA damage response and DNA repair in
aged HSCs will enable us to uncover ways to prevent aging due to alcohol and potentially due to other
endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging agents as well."

The current conceptualization of genetic frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) is that
they are neurodegenerative diseases with symptoms developing later in life. Yet, studies in animal models
support the notion that autosomal dominant genes whose mutations cause these diseases play critical roles in
neurodevelopment. Previous studies show that young adult presymptomatic carriers for FTD and AD mutations
show detectable differences in the neural circuits that are also targeted during the symptomatic phase. It
remains unknown how early these abnormalities start and the extent to which children with these mutations
may show clinical overlap with neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD),
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and language-based learning disabilities (LBLD). Studying
children with FTD and AD mutations offers a unique model to evaluate lifelong neural circuit vulnerability since
each disease targets distinct neural circuits. At the UCSF Dyslexia Center, we will cross-sectionally study
children from families with a known genetic mutation for FTD or AD and compare them children with ASD,
ADHD, and LBLD. Aims 1 and 2 will compare children carrying a genetic mutation for FTD and children
carrying a genetic mutation for AD with noncarrier family members to identify differences in brain structure and
neural network connectivity. Aim 3 will explore comparisons between mutation carriers and children with ASD,
ADHD, and LBLD. Upon completion, we will have identified how early disease-specific neural circuit
differences arise in genetic FTD and AD. These findings will reveal important insights into the underlying
biology of these diseases and when biomarker differences develop during the lifespan for genetic FTD and AD."

Our team - in collaboration with other vaccine developers - has been actively involved in tuberculosis (TB)
vaccine discovery for the past three decades and led the team that developed the M72 vaccine that has provided
proof of concept for effective subunit TB vaccines. Obstacles limiting commercial deployment of M72 include
limited efficacy (~50% prevention of disease) and cost of goods for large-scale production. With these
considerations in mind, our group developed a second-generation subunit vaccine, ID93, which consists of four
protein antigens (M72 has two) formulated with a synthetic TLR4 targeted adjuvant formulation, as opposed to
the natural product-based adjuvant contained in the M72 vaccine. ID93 has progressed to Phase 2 human clinical
trials, with promising results and is currently in further development. Human immune responses measured
against the ID93 components have been instructive and have allowed further antigen prioritization with a goal of
complementing the antigens of M72.
We have concurrently developed a new RNA vaccine platform - now in clinical development as a COVID-19
vaccine which may be approved in India in summer 2021 - and that induced potent cellular immunity and can be
scaled in a cost-effective manner. Using a select panel of antigens, we will apply our RNA technology for inducing
effective systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice and non-human primates. In addition, each of our
RNA based adjuvants, TLR3 and RIG-I agonists, both being effective inducers of both innate and adaptive
immune responses adds an innovative aspect.
In this proposal, our innovation comes from three main areas of emphasis: First is optimization of the RNA
vaccine technology by using new replicons and delivery systems. Second is applying RNA vaccination with
subunit protein/adjuvant boosting, using adjuvants of known efficacy (TLR4 agonists) in comparison with novel
adjuvants that signal through the TLR-3 or RIG-I pathways. Neither of these have been exploited extensively for
infectious disease vaccines - particularly in the area of mucosal immunity. The third area comes from innovation
in manufacturing and supply: We have novel processes for the production of TBRNA that were transferred to
India (Gennova) and Brazil (CIMATEC). Gennova has already produced 1 million doses, with a target of 100
million by year-end, and has completed Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in India. Similarly, we have acquired large-
scale access to our adjuvant molecules (TLR4, TLR3, RIG-I), all synthetic, thus avoiding the intellectual property
roadblock encountered with M72."

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive disease for which there remains a critical need for therapies
that provide durable benefit and biomarkers to guide treatment selection. While immunotherapy provides clinical
benefit for some patients, overall survival with current chemotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in unselected
patient populations remains only ~12 months. A particularly understudied feature of SCLC is therapeutic
approaches to enhance immune-mediated responses for this largely immune “cold” cancer. Our group has
previously identified promising drug targets, strategies to enhance immunotherapy response, and candidate
predictive biomarkers for SCLC (including PARP and other DNA damage response inhibitors alone an in
combination with immunotherapy). These have been rapidly translated into clinical trials. To address current
research gaps (outlined in the NCI’s SCLC Progress Working Group report), including (1) investigation of the
SCLC microenvironment (including the potential and limitations of immunotherapy), (2) tumor heterogeneity, (3)
characterization of longitudinal patient samples, (4) models of newly identified subtypes, and (5) development of
blood-based biomarker approaches, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with scientific, clinical,
translational, and computational expertise in the field of SCLC and cancer immunology. Together with our
Thoracic Bioinformatics Working Group, we recently found that there are four distinct, expression-based
molecular subsets of SCLC, including a novel “Inflamed” subtype (Gay et al, Cancer Cell, 2021). Importantly,
these SCLC subtypes (SCLC-ASCLC, NEUROD1, POU2F3, and SCLC-Inflamed) have distinct therapeutic
vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to enhance response to ICB combinations. We have generated and profiled
new patient-derived xenograft models from biopsies and circulating tumor cells (“CDXs”) representing the major
SCLC subtypes. These, together with an established humanized mouse model system, will enable us to deeply
characterize mechanisms of immune response to combinations of ICB and DNA damaging therapies. Based on
our data, we hypothesize that SCLC subtypes and SLFN11 status will determine distinct, immune mediated
responses to DNA damaging therapies and ICB and that novel combinations targeting replication stress may
enhance ICB response in immune “cold” SCLC. To address these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will determine the
SCLC molecular subtype-specific immune modulatory effects of DNA damaging therapy in co-clinical trials in
vivo and in patient specimens before and after treatment. In Aim 2, we will investigate cancer cell SLFN11 as a
predictive biomarker and its role in STING pathway activation and anti-tumor immunity. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will
assess methods to overcome resistance, including alternative DNA damaging agents combined with ICB. The
overall hypothesis is that molecular subtyping of SCLC tumors, paired with strategies to enhance immunotherapy
response, will improve survival for patients with SCLC by providing a personalized, biomarker-informed approach
to therapy."

High expression of the intrinsically disordered protein Meningioma-1 (MN1) is common in AML,
and associated with a poor prognosis. Forced expression of MN1 in murine hematopoietic
progenitors induces an aggressive leukemia. We recently discovered that the primary interaction
partner of MN1 is the BAF nucleosome-positioning complex. MN1 stabilizes BAF on chromatin.
MN1 binding is associated with sustained active enhancer chromatin at enhancers regulating a
hematopoietic stem/progenitor program. Intriguingly, MN1’s entire coding frame is disordered. We
hypothesize that MN1 causes AML by overstabilizing transcriptional hubs by increasing multi-
valent, low affinity interactions that result in high local concentrations of BAF and early
hematopoietic transcription factors. A better understanding of how MN1 causes leukemia may
identify opportunities for targeted therapies in a patient population who is failing conventional AML
therapy."

Cancer cells require a steady stream of nutrients to support their oncogene-driven growth. However, the blood
vessels that supply these nutrients are often tortuous and leaky. Desmoplasia can also lead to elevated
interstitial pressure that collapses tumor blood vessels, further compromising nutrient delivery. Cancer cells
overcome these supply-side limitations by scavenging macromolecules from the microenvironment. One
scavenging strategy employed by tumors is macropinocytosis, a process by which extracellular material is non-
specifically engulfed and then degraded in the lysosome to produce nutrients. Oncogenic mutations in RAS,
activation of the PI3K pathway, and EGFR and WNT signaling drive macropinocytosis in pancreatic, prostate,
lung, colon, bladder, and breast cancer cell lines. When provided with macropinocytic fuel, these cancer cells
are able to proliferate in nutrient-limiting conditions. However, is not currently clear whether the quantity and
quality of material present in the tumor microenvironment is sufficient for macropinocytosis to make a
significant contribution to tumor anabolism. All published studies have depended upon EIPA for in vivo
macropinocytosis inhibition. EIPA is an inhibitor of Na+/H+ exchangers that has pleiotropic anti-neoplastic
effects independent of macropinocytosis inhibition. What is currently lacking is a strategy to selectively disrupt
macropinocytosis in vivo. As a result, it has not been possible to accurately define the contribution of
macropinocytosis to tumor growth or the potential therapeutic value of targeting this pathway. Given that
nutrient recycling via autophagy plays a major role in both tumor progression and therapeutic resistance, it is
likely that nutrient scavenging through macropinocytosis will play a similarly important role. Aim 1 of this
proposal will assess the extent to which selective macropinocytosis inhibition limits tumor growth. Aim 2 will
evaluate the role of macropinocytosis in therapeutic resistance. Aim 3 will dissect the signals that promote
macropinosome formation in tumor cells. Completing these studies will fill major gaps in our knowledge and
could lead to new single-agent and/or combination therapies for cancer. Because some of the most difficult to
treat cancers are macropinocytic (e.g. pancreas, KRAS+ colorectal, triple-negative breast, and castration-
resistant prostate cancers), these studies have the potential to make a significant impact on patient survival."
10817763,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are known causes of cognitive and functional decline, but
some individuals are more resilient to these diseases and continue to function normally despite associated
brain changes. Cognitive reserve has been invoked to explain better cognition than expected based on the
presence and severity of disease. There is evidence modifiable lifestyle factors may build cognitive reserve;
elucidating these associations has major practical implications for public health policy and interventions to
build reserve, thus reducing the impact of ADRD and promoting healthy aging. The overarching goal of this
project is to transition from a hypothetical and often post-hoc construct of cognitive reserve to a concrete
understanding of the variables that promote resilience and the mechanisms by which they protect against
cognitive and functional decline. In this competitive renewal we will use novel imaging approaches, an
unprecedented multi-racial/ethnic sample, and prospectively collected midlife data; each of these components
constitutes a major innovation over previous studies. Aim 1 will delineate brain resources underlying cognition
and everyday function. We will employ discovery-based neuroimaging techniques to better understand the
contributions of cortical neurodegeneration, vascular brain injury, and amyloid deposition to cognitive and
functional outcomes. We will leverage four longitudinal cohorts (N = >700) with harmonized imaging,
cognitive and functional data among four major racial/ethnic groups (Latinos, non-Latino Asians, non-Latino
Blacks, and non-Latino Whites) to examine racial/ethnic group similarities and differences in brain
mechanisms underlying cognition and function. Models developed in Aim 1 will also serve to enhance the
precision by which we can operationalize cognitive reserve as residual cognition after accounting for brain
changes. We also extend our approach for cognitive reserve to operationalize functional reserve. Loss of
independence is a major concern for older adults and better understanding factors that reduce disability is
critical. Aim 2 will develop longitudinal models of cognitive and functional reserve and investigate how
dynamic reserve impacts ADRD clinical outcomes. Aim 3 will evaluate how life course risk and resilience
factors build or deplete cognitive and functional reserve and whether these relationships vary across

of medical, lifestyle, and psychosocial data (vascular risks, physical/cognitive activity, personality,
stress/adversity and social connection) prospectively collected in the 1960s-1990s (during midlife) in addition

its life course determinants. This project will leverage unique data, multidisciplinary expertise, and an

African American (AA) women experience higher rates of breast cancer mortality, even when accounting for
confounding clinical and sociodemographic factors. This disparity reflects in part the fact that AA women in the
US are approximately twice as likely as Caucasian (CA) women to develop Triple-Negative Breast Cancer
(TNBC), a particularly aggressive breast cancer subset. However, even among those with TNBC, AA race is
independently associated with inferior treatment responses and poorer survival rates. These and other data
including our own work have led to an emerging consensus that that this excess mortality is due in part to
biological differences between TNBCs in AA versus CA women. For example, recent genomic analyses have
demonstrated distinct somatic mutation profiles in TNBCs among AA women. Our recent analysis of gene
expression subtypes of TNBC by race showed that the increase in disease progression among AA women was
selective for the intrinsic basal TNBC subset. In a separate study, we and collaborators demonstrated distinct
mechanisms of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency in TNBCs from AA versus CA women. Finally, we
also discovered that inferred subclonal heterogeneity, a measure reflecting malignant cell sub-populations
within the tumor that is known to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in TNBC, in significantly higher in
TNBCs of AA compared to CA women. This finding may explain why bulk tumor analysis has largely failed to
provide mechanistic or actionable insights into the biological differences in TNBC between AA and CA women.
Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that distinct tumor characteristics including increased
subclonal heterogeneity contribute to poorer clinical outcomes for AA women with TNBC. These results
warrant a focused and detailed investigation of TNBC biology in AA women. Accordingly, we have initiated a
coordinated, innovative and highly synergistic inter-institution collaboration, bringing together leading
investigators with complementary expertise, employing state-of-the-art methodologies to address this unmet
need. We propose genomic, epigenetic and gene expression profiling including single-cell analysis in TNBCs
among AA and other women in order to reveal drivers that explain poorer outcomes in the AA population and
discover new, therapeutically actionable means of intervening. We will Identify driver pathways and cell
subpopulations that correlate with primary response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy among AA vs. CA women
with TNBC. We will then examine clonal selection and discover resistant sub-populations through pre/post
neoadjuvant chemotherapy analysis of TNBC in AA women. Next, we will determine the prevalence by race of
genomic/epigenetic alterations and cell subpopulations and their ability to predict long-term outcomes through
retrospective TNBC cohort analysis. Finally, we will establish ex vivo and PDX models of primary TNBC for
specific mechanistic and therapeutic hypothesis testing. Together, these studies will provide the means for
rapid clinical translation and will enable personalized therapy for AA women with TNBC."

The biological basis of PD with dementia (PDD) is heterogeneous, involves multiple cognitive domains, and is
challenging to characterize. Fronto-striatal executive/attentional impairments are core early features and are
influenced by dopaminergic neurotransmission. PDD arises when a distinct visuospatial cognitive syndrome--
thought to be mediated by non-dopaminergic changes—begins to substantially affect the integrity of posterior
cortical regions. The pathological substrates underlying these impairments are diverse and involve the toxic
effects of misfolded neuronal alpha-synuclein along with non-synuclein pathologies such as Amyloid-beta
(Abeta) plaques, tau aggregates, and vascular cognitive impairment. The heterogeneous nature of these
pathologies and their clinical manifestations is summarized by the “dual-hit” hypothesis: a well-accepted but
never-before-tested principle in current models of PDPDD pathogenesis. We propose a proof-of-concept PD
trial aimed at delaying visuospatial cognitive decline, a critical component of PDD. In PD, low-range cortical
Abeta plaque levels—well below the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnostic threshold—associate with serotonin
terminal losses. This specific serotonin-Abeta characteristic is true of PD but not AD. Our published multicenter
PD observational findings show that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) associate with lower PDD
conversion risk and altered CSF Abeta-42 levels. Our preliminary data, using Abeta Pittsburgh compound B
(PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) in PD, show less 2-year visuospatial cortex Abeta plaque accrual
and reduced visuospatial cognitive decline in subjects on serotoninergic medications, perhaps modifying a key
arbiter of PDPDD risk. Our long-term vision is a PDPDD prevention trial, in which citalopram would be
initiated prior to Abeta-linked cognitive decline. Our central hypothesis is that citalopram use in PD will reduce
visuospatial cortex Abeta plaque accrual, leading to an amelioration of visuospatial cognitive decline linked to
PDD. Our objective is to test this hypothesis in a proof-of-concept trial of citalopram 20mg daily over 2 years in
PD subjects (age ≥65) without depression (n=58). In Aim 1, we will test differences in 2-year PiB PET accrual
within the visuospatial cortex between citalopram and placebo groups. In Aim 2, we will measure the impact of
this visuospatial cortex Abeta intervention upon visuospatial cognitive function. In Aim 3, we will test whether
citalopram relative to placebo confers a minimal clinically important difference of benefit as assessed by a
common measure of multi-domain cognition, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, linked to PDD diagnosis. At
the conclusion of this study, we will have well-powered dataset to assess our rigorous Go/No-Go criteria for
this safe and generalizable PDD prevention therapy. We will also conduct analyses (Aims 1, 2, & 3) that will
help to either substantiate or invalidate the dual-hit model of PDPDD pathogenesis, a significant contribution
to the PD field with implications for other Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) conditions as well."

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a devastating clinical disorder and the leading cause of disability
worldwide. Adolescence is a key developmental period during which risk for the development of depression is
greatest. Behavioral Activation (BA) psychotherapy has emerged as a first-line treatment for adolescent
depression, yet the underlying neurobiological mechanisms that mediate treatment efficacy remain unclear.
Understanding these target mechanisms is fundamental to developing novel adaptations of BA, augmenting
other treatments with BA, and designing new interventions informed by greater comprehension of neural target
mechanisms. In the current application, we seek to identify the neural mechanisms that mediate treatment
response during BA therapy for adolescent depression. Critically, reductions in avoidance behavior and
successful BA treatment may occur through manipulation of multiple neural targets operating on different
timescales between and/or within individuals. In cross-sectional neuroimaging studies of adolescent
depression, the most common markers are hypo-responding to reward cues in the ventral striatum (VS) and
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and hyper-responding to negative information in the amygdala and the
salience network–comprising the anterior insula (aI) and dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC). These patterns of
hypo- and hyper-responding regions may independently or jointly contribute to behavioral avoidance by the
RDoC concepts of reduced motivation for rewards and threat avoidance, respectively. Consequently, a fuller
understanding of target engagement for BA requires multiple assessments linking trajectories of behavioral
and symptom change with trajectories of change in these neural circuits over the course of therapy as opposed
to just pre/post comparisons. To address these concerns, we propose to acquire ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) and longitudinal neuroimaging data in a sample of 96 depressed adolescents while they
complete a 16-week course of BA therapy. Three task-based fMRI scans will occur at baseline and after
sessions 7 and 16, and will include a set of paradigms focused on assessing behavioral avoidance for
monetary and social rewards. In addition, two brief “behavioral-scheduling-in-scanner” sessions will occur at
sessions 3 and 9 during which the patient and therapist will engage in a component of BA therapy while the
patient undergoes an fMRI scan. This “behavioral-secheduling-in-scanner” protocol will allow us to better
determine the ecological validity of task-based measures of target engagement during psychotherapy. Taken
together, these data will enable understanding of the neural mechanisms through which BA reduces avoidance
behavior and thereby treats depression, Further, these data will establish a platform for developing future
modifications of BA techniques and/or novel treatments based on identifiable neural targets."

Alcohol associated health problems are a major medical burden in industrialized countries. Patients with
alcohol-associated liver disease show intestinal bacterial dysbiosis and increased intestinal permeability.
Although there is considerable progress in understanding the interaction between the host and intestinal
bacteria, the role of the intestinal fungal microbiome (also called mycobiome) in alcohol-associated liver
disease is not very well understood. Results from our laboratories indicate a proportional increase of
Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Malassezia restricta (M. restricta) in patients with alcohol use disorder.
Results from chronic ethanol administration in mice or chronic alcohol abuse in patients show that
C. albicans-specific T cell responses occur in the intestine. CD4+ T cells re-circulate to the liver, where they
re-activate by translocated C. albicans antigens, produce interleukin 17 (IL17) and contribute to progression
of ethanol-induced steatohepatitis. In addition, products from M. restricta translocate from the gut lumen to
the systemic circulation and liver. M. restricta induces liver inflammation via ligation with the Dectin-2
(Clec4n) receptor on Kupffer cells and augments ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. The testable central
hypothesis of this proposed collaborative and multidisciplinary research application implicates disturbances
in the gut fungal mycobiota as an important etiological factor in the modulation of adaptive and innate
immunity in the liver. Through the proposed study, we will characterize the host gut mycobiome and
immune response in a human cohort. We will mechanistically test our hypothesis in a mouse model of
ethanol-induced liver disease. Towards this goal, we will use pharmacological interventions,
supplementation of fungi and genetically modified mice. We predict that two pathogenic factors contribute to
dysfunction of the gut-liver axis in alcohol-associated liver disease: C. albicans overgrowth drives Th17 cell
expansion contributing to liver inflammation and damage (Aim 1). Binding of M. restricta to Dectin-2 induces
hepatic inflammation and exacerbates alcohol-associated liver disease (Aim 2). We believe these studies
will provide important insights into alcohol-mediated changes of the intestinal mycobiome that result in an
immune response contributing to alcohol-associated liver disease. Eventually this approach might lead to
new therapeutic targets for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease."

Teriparatide (PTH1-34) and Abaloparatide (modified PTHrP1-34) are approved anabolic drugs for the
treatment of osteoporosis, a widespread bone fragility chronic condition linked to aging, with important health
and socio-economic consequences. Osteoporosis and aging involve dysfunctions of cells in bone, often
associated with an increase in bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT). Estrogen deficiency, glucocorticoid
treatment or decreased mechanical loading lower bone mass but also increase BMAT. PTH and WNT
signaling oppose both effects, further suggesting a clinical link between low bone mass and high marrow
adiposity. The maintenance of bone mass is essential for the prevention of osteoporosis and fractures in the
elderly, whereas the consequences of excessive BMAT are still not understood. Because osteoblasts (OBs)
and adipocytes (ADs) share a common precursor in the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) lineage it is thought
that the increase in bone marrow ADs is linked to the decrease in OB differentiation. Moreover, MSCs derived
from bone marrow or from fat are used in bone regeneration, and PTH is now widely used clinically for
fracture healing. The mechanisms by which PTH favors bone at the expense of BMAT and the role of BMAT
reduction in the response of bone to PTH are however not known. Characterization of novel downstream PTH
effectors in MSCs for the OB versus AD cell fate decision and in the crosstalk between PTH and WNT could
have a significant impact on the development or understanding of anabolic osteoporosis treatment as well as
on the use of MSCs for bone regeneration. The proposed work is innovative because it focuses on the anti-
adipogenic responses to PTH/PTHrP treatment and their implication in anabolic responses of the skeleton. The
main goal of this application is to identify the components of the signal transduction machinery that allows
intermittent PTH (iPTH) to promote bone formation and repress BMAT, in order to determine whether
interfering with the anti-adipogenic factor Zfp521 or the pro-adipogenic factors Zfp467 and Zfp423, can
enhance the therapeutic effects of treatment with iPTH, i.e. whether preventing the AD differentiation may
enhance the anabolic effects of iPTH. We will determine whether enhancing (via deletion of the anti-ADgenic
factor Zfp521) or blocking (via deletion of the pro-ADgenic factors Zfp467 or Zfp423) pro-adipogenic signals
downstream of the PPR could impair or favor, respectively, the bone anabolic responses to iPTH treatment. To
this end, we will identify the PPR signaling events that repress adipogenic targets in order to possibly improve
bone anabolic responses by enhancing the anti-adipogenic effects of iPTH. For this reason, and since we have
identified three key regulators of adipogenesis in MSCs, we propose to dissect the signaling pathways
downstream of the PPR that lead to the increased expression of Zfp521 and the repression of Zfp467 and
Zfp423.

by consistent top enrollment in nearly every CTSN trial. UVA will function as the experienced network site in
this proposal and will partner with less experienced site in West Virginia University (WVU) who proudly cared
for a large underserved population with a reputation for high quality clinical care. Recently, great investments
have been made to develop the WVU Heart and Vascular Institute, led by Dr. Vinay Badhwar, as an integrated
service line model combining cardiac surgery and cardiology under a single leader. Dr. Badhwar is a renowned
cardiac surgeon with national leadership roles in our major societies as well as strong relationships with
industry. He has recruited several top notch surgeons, cardiologists, and imagers with excellent track records
in clinical trials and high quality care. Moreover, the recent reorganization at WVU has resulted in a significant
investment in research funds and infrastructure. Collectively, these investments make WVU an ideal site to join
the Network, with ability and capacity to contribute highly to patient enrollment and trial designs. Further, our
sites serve unique underserved patients with high cardiovascular disease burden, who travel from great
distances to receive their care. Our specific aims focus on three areas: 1) To optimize participation and utilize
novel and innovative approaches for the recruitment and retention of patients in CTSN trials among our two

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is estimated to affect 25% of the adult population in the United
States and approximately 25% of NAFLD patients progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),
characterized by liver inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, and fibrosis. Importantly, NASH increases the risks
for cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. The processes that trigger the progression of NAFLD
to NASH or even if there is a true stepwise progression from one pathological state to the other remain to be
determined. NAFLD is associated with increases in liver triglycerides and elevated rates of fatty acid synthesis.
Nevertheless, since most NAFLD patients do not have NASH, it is not clear if elevated fatty acids alone are
sufficient to promote inflammation and fibrosis. Cholesterol is also increased in the livers of patients with NASH
and non-esterified cholesterol correlates with disease severity. We reasoned that a unique approach to
unraveling the roles of cholesterol in chronic liver diseases would be to reversibly disrupt cholesterol sensing.
Liver x receptor alpha (LXRα) functions as an important cholesterol sensor that regulates hepatic fat and
cholesterol metabolism at the transcriptional level in response to the direct binding of cholesterol derivatives.
To disrupt cholesterol sensing we have generated mouse lines that change tryptophan 441 of LXRα to
phenylalanine (W441F). W441F disrupts binding of endogenous cholesterol derived LXR ligands while still
allowing transcription regulation by potent synthetic agonists providing a unique tool that blocks the ability of
LXRα to sense cholesterol while still allowing pharmacological control.
 When fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet LXRα W441F mice rapidly (within 4 weeks) develop
pathologies associated with NASH. Strikingly W441F mice have decreased hepatic triglycerides but large
increases in cholesterol. Therefore, NASH-like phenotypes can arise in the absence of elevated hepatic
triglycerides (“cholesterol-dependent NASH”). We hypothesize that decreased LXR activity in W441F
hepatocytes leads to cholesterol accumulation which serves as the initiating event promoting
inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, we propose that elevated hepatic cholesterol promotes NASH, at
least in part, via cholesterol-dependent activation of the transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif
(TAZ, Wwtr1). TAZ is over expressed in livers of human NASH patients and promotes inflammation and
fibrosis when over expressed in mouse models. Finally, our ability to re-establish LXR activity in W441F
mice using pharmacological agents provides a unique opportunity to determine if cholesterol-
dependent NASH can be reversed. Taken together our proposed studies will provide new insights into the
mechanisms by which elevated cholesterol levels contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH and other chronic
diseases."

An effective vaccine would complement other public health measures and is likely essential for putting an end
to the high burden of malaria worldwide. Unfortunately, most malaria vaccines that entered late-stage clinical
development, have shown moderate efficacy in low and middle income countries. Through a number of
studies vaccine efficacy was shown to vary from 20% to 100% when used in different countries and
populations. Better understanding of factors that influence this variation is urgently needed. Even within a
country significant differences in vaccine efficacy in rural and urban areas are present. This implies that
exposure to environmental factors plays a major role besides genetic determinants. How and to what extent
environmental exposures can influence immune profiles and in turn affect responses to vaccines? This
question will be addressed in the current proposal. Technological advances in “omics” platforms have
improved our ability to examine the immune system in a more unbiased manner. Such platforms, involving
transcriptomics, are being increasingly applied to understand vaccine responses, with promising results.
However, for malaria vaccines, no harmonized approach to interrogate immunological reactivities and
pathways across cohorts has been developed despite its public health importance and availability of cohorts
assessed for a clinically relevant outcome (prevention of infection or disease). Even less has been done
regarding integrated “omics”, comparing populations living in different geographical locations and their
response to vaccines. Moreover, there are very little data that link environmental exposures to in depth
changes in the immune system and if available, the studies often address one environmental factor at a time.
We propose to address this and not only assess correlations in malaria vaccine cohorts, but also to address
the mechanisms underlying vaccine (hypo)responsiveness. We will build on available knowledge of
immunological processes that can affect malaria vaccine responses, and use samples from the cohorts where
high dimensional cytometry and RNASeq and antibody interrogations will help to refine and enrich the
questions regarding malaria vaccine (hypo)responsiveness. In addition, by using human primary hepatocytes
infected with P. falciparum, we will bring the research closer to mechanisms of tissue-specific responses and
to extrapolate pre-erythrocytic immunity to malaria in the liver. This is of particular importance for pre-
erythrocytic vaccines, where tissue-resident responses can play an important role.
By generating data on the same individuals, data integration approaches for high dimensional mediation
analysis, will be used to pinpoint the specific immunological pathways and mechanisms that result in malaria
vaccine (hypo) responsiveness. This information can be used to improve malaria vaccine efficacy and also to
identify individuals who will not benefit from the vaccine regimens used so far. It can direct, in an evidence
based manner, alterations to the vaccination dose, intervals and adjuvants."

This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on the translation of oncolytic
modified poliovirus (PVSRIPO) into a novel treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. The candidate is
currently an Assistant Professor of Surgery at Duke University. The candidate has previous research and clinical
experience in the management of patients with advanced melanoma and has now chosen to focus on
immunology-driven approaches with a mentor who is an accomplished immunologist, Smita Nair, PhD. The
proposed experiments and didactic work will provide the candidate with a unique set of immunologic and
laboratory skills that will enable her transition to independence as a physician scientist in the field of melanoma
therapeutics.
Melanoma has been dramatically increasing in incidence for the last 30 years and is the most common fatal skin
malignancy. Programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) antagonists represent important recent advances in the care
of patients with metastatic melanoma. However, 60% of patients fail to respond to PD-1 therapy and late
resistance remains a problem. Oncolytic virotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment for advanced
melanoma due to its ability to elicit anti-neoplastic effects stemming from combined direct viral cytotoxicity and
innate antiviral activation. PVSRIPO, the live attenuated, serotype 1 poliovirus vaccine that was genetically
modified to eliminate its neurovirulence, has shown unprecedented long-term survival in 20% of recurrent
glioblastoma multiforme patients, otherwise a nearly uniformly fatal disease. Further development of PVSRIPO
as treatment for advanced melanoma will fulfill a clinical need for more effective therapies for these patients.
More specifically, the aims of this proposal are: 1) investigate PVSRIPO induced immune bioactivity in melanoma
tumor tissue obtained from a Phase I trial of patients with advanced melanoma, 2) determine the efficacy of
mouse PVSRIPO treatment, in conjunction with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, on tumor growth in vivo, 3) determine
PVSRIPO-mediated immune activation in vitro in a tumor explant model. The scientific objectives of this proposal
are to 1) define how PVSRIPO treatment facilitates engagement of anti-tumor immune responses and 2) to
determine if administration of mouse PVSRIPO with concurrent PD-1/PD-L1 antagonists will eliminate adaptive
resistance and potentiate durable-anti-tumor responses."

 The Golgi complex is the central sorting station for nearly a third of all proteins in eukaryotic cells, but
how cells regulate the flow of material through this organelle remains unknown. Secretory traffic must pass
through the Golgi to be fully glycosylated and proteolytically processed. The Golgi must successfully traffic
hundreds of membrane and lumenal proteins to several different sub-cellular destinations including the plasma
membrane, endosomes, lysosomes, and the endoplasmic reticulum. Protein and membrane traffic into and out
of the Golgi is controlled by GTPases of the Arf and Rab families that function by recruiting effector proteins to
generate, transport, and tether membrane vesicles and tubules. The master regulators of these essential GTPase
pathways are the GEF (guanine-nucleotide exchange factor) proteins that must “decide” where and when to
activate their substrate GTPases. For most of these GEFs, we do not know how the localization, timing, and
magnitude of their activity is regulated. Therefore, we do not fully understand the molecular logic of Golgi
trafficking. Our lab has focused on deciphering what cellular signals the Golgi GEFs are listening to, and how
the GEFs interpret these signals. We have discovered that several of these GTPase trafficking pathways
communicate with each other through protein-protein interactions in which an activated GTPase positively
regulates the GEF of another GTPase. One important implication of this finding is that activation of the distinct

broad set of tools, utilizing biochemical reconstitution reactions, structural biology, in vivo functional assays,
live-cell imaging, and genetic experiments. We will use biochemical approaches to determine the precise roles
of GEF regulatory subunits and domains. We will use structural approaches to visualize each GEF “caught in
the act” of performing nucleotide exchange on its GTPase. Mutants generated based on hypotheses arising from
biochemical and structural experiments will then be investigated in vivo to determine the consequences of
perturbing specific interactions and domains. We will use unbiased proteomic and genetic approaches to reveal
the identity of unknown GEFs and to discover unknown regulators of the Golgi GEFs. We will use established
cell biological approaches to determine the physiological importance of the regulatory mechanisms. Taken
together, the combined results of in vivo and in vitro experiments will enable us to determine the mechanisms

Mammalian prions, which cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in humans and livestock
animals, are unorthodox infectious agents that replicate by the autocatalytic conformational
change of the host prion protein (PrPC) into a pathogenic isoform (PrPSc). Taking a reductionist
biochemical approach, we made the surprising discovery that endogenous cofactors such as
the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are required to produce infectious PrPSc
molecules. For example, autocatalytic PrPSc molecules formed with a combination of
recombinant PrP and PE substrates display a specific infectivity >105-fold greater than that of
similar autocatalytic PrPSc molecules formed from PrP alone. We have taken advantage of
this specific information to produce, for the first time, sufficient quantities of fully
infectious, isotopically labeled, and conformationally homogeneous recombinant prions
to perform high-resolution solid state (ss) NMR analysis of PrPSc structure. Here, our
collaborative team proposes to use ssNMR, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry
analysis to elucidate the important structural elements that lead to infectivity. ssNMR will be
used to determine and compare the secondary structure maps of infectious and non-infectious
PrPSc molecules. This work will help identify and characterize specific infectivity-associated
domains as well as crucial NMR residue-peak assignments. Together with constraints from
electron microscopy and mass spectrometry analysis to identify the position of cut points using
digestion by proteinase K, these data will eventually enable structural determination of the entire
PrPSc molecule. We will also use ssNMR to determine precisely the structural mechanism by
which PE induces the infectious prion conformation. Finally, we will use 15N-13C transferred-
echo double resonance (TEDOR) to determine the symmetry pattern of PrPSc subunits in
isotopically mixed samples of infectious recombinant prions. These data will allow us to
discriminate between competing b-solenoid and in-register b-sheet quaternary structure models
of infectious PrPSc molecules. Overall, this proposal is a critical step towards determining
the full high-resolution structural determination of infectious mammalian prions as well
as the structural mechanism of prion infectivity."

The accumulation of somatic DNA mutations in driver genes within the hematopoietic system can provide a
fitness advantage to the mutant cell and thus allow for its clonal expansion. This process is referred to as clonal
hematopoiesis and leads to a situation where a substantial fraction of an individual’s blood cells are replaced by
clones with the driver gene mutation. Previous large exome sequencing studies in humans have shown that
these somatic mutations accumulate during aging and are associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular-related
deaths. Moreover, recent experimental studies support the idea that clonal hematopoiesis causally promotes
cardiovascular disease (CVD). More recently, genotoxic stresses such as radiation or chemotherapy have also
been shown to facilitate hematopoietic clonal expansion in cancer patients. Compared with age-related clonal
hematopoiesis that is mediated primarily by mutations in epigenetic regulators such as DNMT3A and TET2,
clonal hematopoiesis resulting from prior exposure to cytotoxic therapy is uniquely associated with high
frequencies of mutations in TP53 and PPM1D. This clonal selection/expansion of TP53 and PPM1D mutant
clones by cancer therapy may subsequently increase the risk of CVD, and addressing this clinically-relevant
question represents the main objective of the current proposal.
In fact,
over the past decade, the number of
cancer survivors has grown, thus there has been a paradigm shift in the approach to survivor care with a renewed
focus on maximizing non-cancer-related outcomes, such as CVD. Therefore, there is an unmet need to
understand the potential connection between cancer-therapy related clonal hematopoiesis and CVD. Thus, this
study aims to examine whether a causal connection exists between therapy-related clonal hematopoiesis and
chemotherapy-associated cardiomyopathy. As a proof-of-concept, I will test the hypothesis that TP53- and
PPM1D-mediated clonal hematopoiesis contributes to anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy using
sophisticated animal models."
10821486,"Premise: The combination of selectivity and affinity afforded by biomolecules such as antibodies for their target
ligands make them ideal recognition elements for bioassays. While these affinity reagents have enabled the
development of many important bioassays, these measurements are almost always performed as static analyses
at an individual time point. The slow off rates of affinity reagents makes development of responsive assays that
can monitor changes in analyte concentration over time a challenge. Reagent degradation, non-specific surface
interactions, and biofouling present additional difficulties. Our goal is to develop an online, flow-through, affinity
assay that can continuously monitor the efflux of biochemical messengers from dynamically changing biological
systems in real time. Our premise is that microfluidic integration of a perfusion chamber, online mixing of affinity
reagents and continuous micro free flow electrophoresis (µFFE) separations will directly address limitations that
have restricted the development of time responsive affinity-based assays to date.
Innovation: We will use a microfluidic, flow through approach to develop time responsive affinity assays. The
biological model (i.e., cell culture) will be housed in a perfusion chamber. Perfusate will be mixed online with a
fluorescently labeled affinity reagent (i.e., antibody or aptamer) that selectively binds the target analyte. Online
µFFE will then be used to continuously separate the analyte-affinity reagent complex from excess affinity reagent
in real time. Online affinity µFFE offers several advantages. Continuous flow removes off rate as a limitation to
temporal response. Exposure to the biological matrix is minimal, mitigating reagent degradation. Signal is
measured in solution, limiting the effect of non-specific surface interactions and biofouling. µFFE separation
enables interference free measurement of the analyte-affinity reagent complex even when the affinity reagent is
applied in large excess, improving the LOD of the assay.
Approach: Affinity µFFE assays will be developed for representative analytes from three biochemical
messenger systems: neuropeptide Y (NPY, neurotransmission), leptin (energy regulation), and tumor necrosis
factor α (TNF-α, immune response). Direct comparisons will be made between assays that use antibodies (Aim
#1) or aptamers (Aim #2) as the affinity reagent. Figures of merit that will be used to assess assay performance
include: LOD, temporal response, minimum detectable change, and long-term stability. Once fully optimized,
affinity µFFE assays will be used to continuously monitor both baseline and stimulated efflux from cell models
for neurotransmission (neurons), energy regulation (adipocytes) and immune response (mast cells).
Benchmarks: We anticipate that affinity µFFE will achieve the following performance metrics: LOD ≤ 1nM;
temporal response ≤ 1 s; minimum detectable change ≤ 5%; and long-term stability ≤ 10% over 4 h.
Impact: Time responsive µFFE assays will allow researchers to study dynamic changes that occur on a ≤1 s
timescale in several critical biochemical messenger systems for the first time."

ADRD dementias account for up to 25% of all dementias in patients older than 65 years and there is strong
evidence of co-morbid pathologies caused by (amyloid β (Aβ), tau and α-synuclein (αSyn). The degree of AD-
related pathology in Lewy Body Dementias (LBD) is moderate or severe in 50% of PDD and more than 70% of
DLB patients have concomitant AD-related pathology so that these patients experience a more heterogeneous,
faster, and severe clinical phenotype. Cognitive impairment is closely associated with synapse loss which occurs
significantly prior to neuronal loss suggesting that synaptic dysfunction is the key treatment target and that
ultimately synapse loss by multiple toxic oligomers (αSyn, Aβ, and tau), that begins with their binding to PrPc,
must be stopped. Our results show that RAP-103, a small oral peptide CCR5 antagonist potently prevents both
αSyn and Aβ-mediated spine and synapse loss in rodent and human neurons by blocking PrPc activation that
disrupts microtubules, spine structure and synapse function. RAP-103 protected rodent and human neuron
spines and synapses from αSyn and Aβ-induced loss, and in a pilot study of the human αSyn expressing animal
model Line 6116, prevented cognitive deficits. By binding to neuronal CCR5, RAP-103 exerts an allosteric
inhibitory effect on membrane bound PrPc/NOX complex activation to block multiple toxic oligomers to stop,
possibly reverse, synapse loss and cognitive decline in ADRD including LBD. Utilizing the Tg4510 mixed α-
Syn/Tauopathy animal model we will conduct a definitive in vivo study of RAP-103 protective effects on synapse
density and disease biomarkers relevant to ADRDs by brain histochemical analysis. We will compare in vivo
histochemical analysis of synapse density to live animal SV2A PET imaging with [18F]SynVesT-1 as a
quantitative biomarker of synaptogenesis. We will administer RAP-103 by oral dosing from months 6 to 7 when
animals experience synapse loss. We will determine RAP-103 effects on markers of brain synapse density in
cortex and hippocampus by quantitative methods measuring expression of Synaptophysin 1, a synaptic vesicle
protein and SVA2, the target of the PET imaging tracer and normalize to total neuron density with NeuN in pre-
identified regions of interest. We will also determine RAP-103 effects on disease biomarkers by measuring the
number of neurofibrillary tangles-NFT load, oligomeric Tau, pThr231Tau, Multimeric total αSyn and pSer129
αSyn. Successful completion of the Aims will support further development of RAP-103 for synapse protecting
effects and suggest using SV2A PET imaging with [18F]SynVesT-1 as a quantitative biomarker of
synaptogenesis in ADRDs, which can then be correlated with biomarkers and cognitive benefits for use in human
testing."

Candidate: The PI is a Research Assistant Professor and nutritional epidemiologist whose primary career goal
is to apply epigenetic approaches to improve the understanding of the interplay of sleep/circadian rhythms and
nutrition on long-term cardiometabolic health risk. The proposed award includes a 5-year plan of training and
research centered on circadian rhythms, epigenetics, study design, and skills required to lead a research team.
Research context: Insufficient and mistimed sleep is recognized as a risk for adverse cardiometabolic
outcomes. Adolescents are especially vulnerable as they have high prevalence of both short sleep duration
and misaligned sleep timing. Yet, the unique contributions of sleep duration and circadian misalignment to
cardiometabolic risk is unclear. Uncovering the epigenetic mechanisms behind these relationships is a highly
promising avenue for this public health issue. Recent cross-sectional evidence shows that epigenetic
alterations of metabolic and circadian genes might play an intermediary role in the relationships between
sleep/circadian rhythms and cardiometabolic health, yet longitudinal investigations are scarce. The application
of epigenetic approaches to identify potential mechanisms that link sleep to cardiometabolic health is novel.
Research Objectives: The aims are two-fold: 1) to evaluate the independent associations of sleep duration
and timing with cardiometabolic health among adolescents and 2) to examine epigenetic associations between
insufficient/mistimed sleep and cardiometabolic health.
Research Plan: The PI will analyze existing data from an NIH-funded established cohort study of adolescents
in Mexico City with highly variable sleep patterns (some participants' sleep patterns are constrained by
morning school shifts while others have more flexibility due to an afternoon school shift). Associations between
objectively collected sleep data (7-days of actigraphy) and cardiometabolic biomarkers (adiposity, blood
pressure, and insulin resistance collected at two time points 24 months apart) will be analyzed. Stored
leukocytes will be used to measure gene expression and epigenome-wide DNA methylation. Longitudinal and
epigenome-wide statistical analyses will be conducted.
Career Goals and Development: The PI will gain expertise in assessment of circadian rhythms, epigenetics
laboratory investigation, and epidemiological study design through didactic and hands-on experiences. She will
also advance in her leadership, mentorship, and grantsmanship skills, and by the end of the training period will
apply for an R01 centered on sleep/circadian rhythms, nutrition, and epigenetics.
Environment: Resources available to the PI include a well-rounded and supportive team of mentors
representing the fields of sleep/circadian rhythms, epigenetics, nutrition and cardiometabolic health; and the
excellent research infrastructure at the University of Michigan School of Public Health where the PI has been
guaranteed 80% of time devoted to the research goals delineated in the proposal."

For about 175,000 leg and hip fractures each year, the best treatment is for an orthopaedic surgeon to implant
a stiff metal rod, or intramedullary (IM) nail, through the center of the bone and fix the nail to the bone with screws
(distal locking). Distal locking can be difficult and time-consuming step and presents two major challenges. First,
the procedure uses C-arm fluoroscopy for guidance and exposes surgeons to radiation. For surgeons with high
case volumes (Level 1 and 2 trauma centers), this results in higher rates of radiation exposure. Recent studies
have demonstrated that the commonly held notion that exposure is negligible is misleading and most orthopaedic
surgeons are inadequately protected. Second, the procedure requires a high rate of precision to avoid less than
ideal patient outcomes, such as limb malrotation. Orthopaedic generalists experience alignment challenges more
often due to smaller case volumes. Difficulty during this procedure also affects patients with longer surgery times,
additional blood loss and increased radiation exposure. A faster and safer method is needed to reduce radiation
exposure and improve patient outcomes. Eclipse Orthopaedics (EO) is a startup focused on improving internal
fixation procedures. Based on patented technology, Eclipse Orthopaedics is developing a freehand targeting
device, the Radiographic Targeting Attachment™ (RTA) that puts both targeting and drilling capabilities literally
in the surgeons’ hands. The RTA combines a small X-ray source and a drill attachment that, when paired with
the imager and drill, becomes a fluoroscopically-guided drill that locates and drills holes in one operation. EO is
currently developing this technology while pursuing a licensing agreement with a major trauma supplier, who will
market the RTA as an integral part of their internal fixation product portfolio. Building off of extensive preliminary
data as well as customer knowledge gained through over 100 customer interviews during I-Corps and an NIH
Niche Assessment, the goal of this Direct to Phase II is to complete a multi-site study among a wide range of
orthopaedic surgeons. The Direct to Phase II project has been designed in response to the FDA’s medical device
design control guidance document. Specific Aims are as follows: (Aim 1) Design, build and verify prototype,
which will reduce the radiation dose to less than half the standard method. (Aim 2) Verify effectiveness and
usability in a multi-site cadaver study. (Aim 3) Begin design control, define regulatory pathway, and improve the
RTA system. At the conclusion of the Direct to Phase II, Eclipse Orthopaedics will have the key system
performance data, human factors insights from evaluations of target users, and a well-defined regulatory path.
Eclipse will plan a comprehensive product development schedule in Phase IIB. EO is located in Warsaw, Indiana,
an epicenter of orthopaedic innovation and industry. Leveraging its industry relationships, EO will continue to
explore the already high interest in licensing from leading orthopedic device manufacturers."

 People living with HIV (PLWH) continue to harbor virus-infected cells despite suppression by antiretroviral
therapy. These reservoir cells are the source of virus rebound that typically occurs in 1-8 weeks if treatment is
discontinued. Eliminating the provirus integrated in the genome of infected cells or the infected cells themselves
can cure PLWH. The recently discovered genome editing technique called CRISPR is being developed as an
approach to target and excise HIV DNA sequences present in infected cells. Large challenges to using the
CRISPR approach for HIV elimination are the wide diversity of viral isolates in PLWH and the risk of genotoxicity
as the Cas9 enzyme causes double-stranded breaks (DSBs) in the host chromosome. The absence of a targeted
delivery system for cells that make up the HIV reservoir increases these risks due to off-target effects.
 This R01 application in response to RFA-AI-20-076: “New Technologies for the In vivo Delivery of Gene
Therapeutics for an HIV Cure” addresses the challenges posed by CRISPR-based gene therapy. We will use a
designer recombinase, Brec1, that has been developed to solely target HIV-1 provirus sequences and remove
these from the genome. 90% of the major HIV-1 subtype groups A, B, and C are expected to harbor the precise
Brec1 target sequence. Brec1 shows no immunogenic potential, does not induce cellular toxicity or display off-
target activity. We will in adition re-engineer Brec1 to generate a super-repressor called Brec1-Off that can
durably silence HIV transcription by epigenetically modifying HIV promoter sequences. Key to the success of
this approach is our development of capsid-engineered adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to deliver Brec1
and Brec1-Off specifically to human T cells and myeloid cells in peripheral tissues and the central nervous
system. AAV vectors are one of safest clinical gene therapy vectors that are approved for human use, albeit one
obstacle is their unselective delivery. We therefore redirect AAV tropism to the human immune cells in tissue
compartments which can harbor HIV-1 proviruses by deleting their natural receptor binding and engineering
specific target cell binders to their surface. Thus we pave the way to the development of a viable, non-invasive
approach for a gene therapy-based cure for HIV/AIDS.
The proposal has two specific aims-
In Specific Aim 1, we will develop AAV6 and AAV9 vectors with capsids modified to target human CD4 T cells
and myeloid cells and optimize their design for expression and delivery of Brec1/Brec1-Off to these human
immune cells as well as thoroughly assay AAV-Brec1 interventions in cell models of HIV-1 infection.
In Specific Aim 2, we will test the capsid-engineered AAV vectors packaging Brec1 and Brec1-Off in three
different physiologically relevant humanized mouse models for HIV infection to assess their ability to inactivate
peripheral and CNS reservoirs of HIV-1 that also contain the diverse HIV isolates found in PLWH."

Lyme disease is an endemic tick-borne disease associated with debilitating manifestations such as arthritis,
muscle pain, carditis, meningitis, and encephalomyelitis. Despite extensive efforts in the field, there is still no
vaccine for the prevention of this infection available for human use. To address this problem, our laboratory has
developed novel methodologies to identify antigens relevant during bacterial infection in ticks and mammals and
design peptide antigens based on extracellular and conserved regions of these proteins.
Our hypothesis for this work is that peptides based on outer-membrane proteins expressed in various phases of
the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi can be used as protective vaccines antigens against Lyme disease. To test
this, we propose to perform RNA sequencing of B. burgdorferi during infection of ticks and mice to identify the
genes most highly expressed in both organisms (Aim 1). Our objective is to synthesize peptides based on the
extracellular regions of these proteins, and determine their antigenicity in a murine model. We will select antigens
that are highly conserved, immunogenic, and do not display cross-reactivity with human antigens to avoid off-
target reactivity (Aim 2). We will then test these antigens in a murine model of vaccination and challenge in
combination with various adjuvants capable of eliciting specific humoral and cellular immune responses. To do
this, we will use various murine reporter systems for IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-17 to measure bacterial clearance and
T-cell response during immunization and challenge (Aim 3). To select the best adjuvant, we will also measure
germinal center formation and memory B and T cell production. At the conclusion of these studies, we will have
formulated a peptide-based vaccine containing antigens based on outer-membrane proteins with an adjuvant
capable of conferring a strong cellular immune response. These studies will help with the identification of novel
antigens and provide answers for the prevention of Lyme disease."
10805787,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
People experiencing homelessness (PEH) are disproportionately affected by the opioid overdose crisis, with
overdose rates up to 30-times higher than the general population. Medications for opioid use disorder (OUD)
substantially reduce mortality, but retention in treatment remains low. Identifying strategies to improve OUD
treatment retention in this population is crucial to enhancing recovery opportunities and reducing mortality.
Peer recovery support has shown promise in improving OUD treatment outcomes in the general population,
but research studying its effects has been limited by a lack of attention to vulnerable populations (e.g., PEH),
heterogeneity in the services provided, and lack of methodologic rigor in study design. This award addresses
all of these gaps and will advance the science of peer recovery support for the treatment of OUD among PEH.
Using a community-engaged framework and a mixed methods design, the investigators will (1) develop a peer
recovery support intervention to promote OUD treatment retention tailored to PEH by incorporating qualitative
findings from patient focus groups and national Health Care for the Homeless program key stakeholder
interviews into a consensus building Delphi process, and (2) pilot test the feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity
of the peer recovery support intervention to promote OUD treatment retention among PEH. The proposed
research complements the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s (NIDA’s) 2022-2026 strategic plan by addressing
two priority areas: advancing the science of recovery support and conducting research in real-world clinical
settings. This proposal also supports several cross-cutting priorities at NIDA: promoting collaboration with
community stakeholders, incorporating patient perspectives into intervention development, and reducing health
disparities. The principal investigator’s (PI’s) long-term career goal is to become an independent physician-
investigator with expertise in designing and testing interventions to improve the health and health care of
marginalized individuals with substance use disorders. Though the PI has a strong research foundation in
epidemiologic and health services research methods, she will need additional training in (1) community-
engaged research with populations disadvantaged by social determinants of health, (2) mixed methods
research, and (3) design and conduct of interventional clinical trials in real-world settings to successfully carry
out this proposal and achieve her long-term goals. To accomplish these training objectives and her proposed
research plan, the PI assembled an exceptional team of mentors, developed a comprehensive training plan,
and will leverage the research expertise and infrastructure at Massachusetts General Hospital, the educational
expertise of Harvard Medical School, and the clinical infrastructure and homelessness expertise of Boston
Health Care for the Homeless Program. The successful completion of the proposed research will position the
PI to submit an NIH R01 application to conduct a full-scale trial of a peer recovery support intervention to
promote OUD treatment retention among PEH and facilitate her goal of becoming an independent investigator."

The overall goal of this 5-year K23 proposal is to support Camille Schneider Worthington, PhD, RD to become
an independent clinical investigator with a research program focused on behavioral interventions for promoting
maternal-child cardiometabolic health. The postpartum period is a critical time for intervening to improve
maternal-child health. Existing behavioral postpartum weight management interventions have had modest
success, particularly among women with overweight/obesity (Ow/Ob; body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m2). Timing of
energy intake may contribute to weight gain and worsening metabolic health postpartum, but no studies have
examined the effects of altering the timing of energy intake to manage postpartum weight and its metabolic
consequences. Time-restricted eating, which is a form of intermittent fasting that involves restricting the daily
ingestive period to ≤10 hours, has received considerable attention for promoting weight loss. Early time-restricted
eating (eTRE) appears to be particularly beneficial as it is a form of time-restricted eating that involves shifting
the majority of caloric intake earlier in the day to align with circadian rhythms in metabolism (i.e., chrononutrition).
eTRE is a simple, focused dietary approach which may confer benefits behaviorally (e.g., improved adherence)
and physiologically (e.g., improved insulin sensitivity) that are especially relevant postpartum. Yet, an eTRE
intervention for improving cardiometabolic health postpartum has not been studied. To begin addressing this
gap, Dr. Worthington received an institutional grant and is currently collecting dietary data and qualitative
feedback from postpartum women to inform the development of a postpartum-adapted eTRE intervention
(completion date: 6/2023). The proposed K23 will then be used to test the feasibility of the eTRE intervention
among postpartum women with Ow/Ob. The proposed 2-arm pilot randomized trial (N=60) is rigorously designed
to accomplish the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week eTRE
intervention among postpartum women with Ow/Ob. Aim 2: Examine the preliminary effects of the eTRE
intervention on weight, body composition, and insulin sensitivity. Aim 3: Investigate the preliminary effects of the
eTRE intervention on energy intake, appetite, and fatigue. Through this proposal, Dr. Worthington will accomplish
the following training objectives: 1) Develop advanced knowledge and experience in behavioral intervention trial
design, implementation, and adaptation; 2) Develop skills and experience in chrononutrition and underlying
circadian and physiological mechanisms; 3) Develop advanced skills and hands-on experience in qualitative
research methods; 4) Professional development and progress to research independence. This proposal
represents a 5-year comprehensive mentoring, training, and research plan to transition the candidate to a
successful independent clinical investigator. By the end of the award period, Dr. Worthington will have
contributed novel data in the growing field of chrononutrition and maternal-child health and have submitted a
competitive R01 to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the refined postpartum eTRE intervention."

Mental illnesses like schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disease (BP) are devastating brain disorders with global unmet medical needs. The “neurodevelopmental” theory posits that disturbances in the production and differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) cause brain development to deviate from its normal path, leading to alterations in neuronal circuitry and behavioral deficits that first manifest themselves in adolescence or adulthood. Genetic risk plays a major role in the etiology of SZ and BP and several robust and replicable risk loci have been identified with significant overlap between these two disorders. Among the top genetic associations, ZNF804A encodes a zinc finger protein. Diverse chromosomal variants of ZNF804A, including deletions and duplications, have also been found in patients with autism and developmental delay. Moreover, neuroimaging and neuropsychological studies have confirmed ZNF804A as an important genetic predictor of abnormal changes in brain structures, connectivity and behavior. However, molecular functions of ZNF804A in the nervous system are completely unknown. Thus, there is a critical need to elucidate the impacts of ZNF804A dysfunction on brain development in early life. Our central hypothesis is that ZNF804A regulates neuronal determination through interacting with translational machinery, and genetic interactions of ZNF804A with other developmental genes. The objective of this application, therefore, is to further dissect the molecular details on how ZNF804A modulates neurogenesis, and to examine genetic functional interactions between ZNF804A and its interacting genes in the knockout mice. This central hypothesis will be tested by following Specific Aims: 1) Define the mechanism of ZNF804A-mediated regulation of protein translation; 2) Determine the role of ZNF804A in neuronal fate commitment in vivo. The research proposal is innovative because this strategy combines in vivo mouse experimental systems with cutting-edge genomic/proteomic techniques. This contribution will be significant because it allows us to measure the effect of ZNF804A on the trajectory of neurodevelopment, and to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to developmental brain disorders."

Interactions between the thalamus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) are important for cognitive function in animals
ranging from rodents to primates. The importance of these long-range networks is highlighted by multiple
neuropsychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia and ADHD. However, most of what we know about
thalamo-cortical circuits comes from sensory systems, where primary thalamic inputs arrive in layer 4 (L4). In
contrast, the mouse PFC is an agranular area that lacks L4, and instead receives higher-order thalamic inputs
directly to superficial layers. We recently discovered that the PFC makes reciprocal connections with both the
mediodorsal (MD) and ventromedial (VM) thalamus. These thalamic nuclei support distinct behaviors, but the
cellular, synaptic and circuit mechanisms for their interactions with PFC are poorly understood. We found MD
strongly drives layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal cells, whereas VM inputs contact the dendrites of a subset of L5
pyramidal cells. Interestingly, both inputs also robustly engage inhibitory networks to drive local inhibition
mediated by GABAergic interneurons. The goal of this proposal is to assess how thalamic inputs engage
different populations of superficial interneurons to mediate inhibition in the PFC. In Specific Aim 1, we use
optogenetics and electrophysiology to study how thalamic inputs drive multiple classes of interneurons in
superficial layers. Our preliminary data suggests that MD and VM engage complementary populations of
interneurons located in different sub-layers. In Specific Aim 2, we then use conditional optogenetics to study
how these interneurons contact excitatory and inhibitory cells within and across layers. Our preliminary data
indicate that the interneurons contacted by MD and VM participate in distinct inhibitory and disinhibitory circuits
across multiple layers. Lastly, in Specific Aim 3, we combine 1-photon optogenetics with 2-photon microscopy
to study how specific populations of interneurons mediate the suppression of dendritic Ca2+ spikes. Our
preliminary data reveal that a sub-population of superficial interneurons mediates robust feed-forward inhibition
in the dendrites. Together, the results from our experiments will answer fundamental questions about the
organization of thalamo-cortical circuits and interneurons in the PFC. They will also help identify potential
therapeutic targets for the many neuropsychiatric disorders that arise from disrupted circuitry within the PFC."

The NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) has led Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that have
determined >250 genomic loci associated with IBD. The vast majority of these loci, which can contain hundreds
of variants, are in non-coding regions enriched for regulatory elements. As a result, determining both the casual
variant and the mechanism by which this variation contributes to IBD is not known for most. A primary goal of
this IBDGC Ancillary RFA is to fill this gap. In line with this goal, we hypothesize that most IBD GWAS loci
contribute to disease by altering activity of regulatory elements defined by accessible, chemically modified
chromatin resulting in changed gene expression and cellular function. Molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL)
define genetic variants associated with cellular processes such as gene expression (eQTL), alternative splicing
isoform usage (sQTL), and gene regulation (chromatin accessible caQTL). These analyses have great potential
to suggest the missing mechanistic link between GWAS loci and the associated disease. Large-scale molecular
QTL efforts in human tissues and cells have primarily used biological material from non-diseased individuals.
While QTLs have been identified for some GWAS loci, the recent Gene-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium
showed a surprising lack of ability to comprehensively determine GWAS-linked eQTL. We hypothesize this lack
of success specifically for IBD is due to three primary factors: (1) only performing eQTL and sQTL and not QTL
related to gene regulation; (2) performing analyses in samples from non-IBD individuals; and (3) limited sample
size. We propose to address this challenge by first focusing on analysis of IBD patient derived tissue samples,
and second performing both expression-based eQTL and sQTL analyses and chromatin-based caQTL analyses
to better link genetic variants to gene regulatory mechanisms. We aim to recruit a diverse patient population to
ensure better generalizability of our results to all IBD patients. To better annotate regulatory region activity, we
will also determine genome-wide landscapes for four histone modifications (H3K36me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3,
H3K4me3) that have been linked to IBD. Based on QTL analyses, we will identify putative casual variants in IBD
GWAS loci and investigate their functional mechanisms in intestinal epithelial cells using patient derived 2D
intestinal monolayer systems. The successful completion of this project will significantly increase our
understanding of how genetic variation contributes to the risk of developing IBD."

The goal of this project is to define dysregulation in key immune checkpoints that regulate microglial activation,
including TREM2-TYROBP-APOE signaling, which is associated with a common pro-inflammatory state, and
how this contributes to progression of degeneration in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). To explore
the hypothesis that proinflammatory microglia are a key component of the pathobiology of retinal degeneration
in AMD, we will use CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of key immune checkpoints in human iPSC-derived microglia and
expose them to multiple components of extracellular deposits that are characteristic of this disease (Aim 1).
This will validate these pathways as potential targets for novel therapeutics aimed at limiting inflammation in
AMD. In Aim 2, we will perform single-nucleus transcriptional profiling of retinal microglia from individuals with
early and late stages of AMD, and those of controls. In Aim 3, we will investigate how transcriptional alterations
in microglia are influenced by the pathologic tissue microenvironment by performing highly multiplexed spatial
analysis of RNA and protein in retinal tissue affected by AMD-associated lesions using spatial co-indexing of
transcriptomes and epitopes for multi-omics mapping by highly parallel sequencing (spatial-CITE-seq).
Assaying transcriptional states in disease associated microglia in retina and within AMD lesions directly using
human samples will provide a new paradigm to understand AMD and probe the largely unaddressed question
of the role of microglia in AMD pathogenesis. It will also set the stage for further study of neuroinflammatory
biology using AMD as a paradigm to discover principles with application to other neurodegenerative diseases.

10795087,"Although p53 is frequently mutated in almost 50% of human cancers, many human tumors
retain wild-type p53 but its activities are downregulated through multiple mechanisms. For example,
Mdm2 is a key repressor of p53 by acting as a major E3 ligase for ubiquitylation-mediated
degradation. Inhibition of Mdm2 is well accepted as a validated approach for the treatment of human
cancers retaining wild-type p53 by reactivating the p53 tumor suppressor function. Nevertheless,
despite of intense efforts in developing highly potent Mdm2 inhibitors, none of them has been
approved therapeutically very effective because of the toxicity of these inhibitors in vivo. To
overcoming this major issue, it is necessary to search for a candidate by thinking about a ‘out of box’
strategy. In this application, we identify the VPRBP-USP2 axis as such a candidate. Like Mdm2,
VPRBP can suppress p53 function by both transcriptional repression and ubiquitylation-mediated
degradation. Interestingly, unlike Mdm2, VPRBP acts as a master regulator of PD-L1.Moreover, the
stability of VPRBP is tightly control by USP2. Blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has been shown
remarkable anti-tumor effects in cancer patients. Interestingly, clinical studies demonstrated that the
success of PD1–PD-L1 blockade by either anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody has a positive correlation
with PD-L1 expression levels in tumor cells. Thus, although high levels of PD-L1 prevents cytotoxic
T cells from effectively targeting tumor cells, it apparently also serves as a potential selective marker
for patient stratification for PD1–PD-L1 blockade therapy. Strikingly, our preliminary studies showed
that combining VPRBP knockdown/or USP2 inhibitors with an anti-PD-1 antibody treatment
dramatically enhanced tumor growth suppression in the immune-proficient mice bearing the tumors
expressing wild type p53. Notably, unlike Mdm2, knockout of the USP2 gene has no obvious effect
on normal development or cell viability in normal tissues. These data suggest that USP2 is a
promising therapeutic target for activating p53-mediated tumor suppressive effects in human
cancers without causing severe toxicity to normal tissues. Thus, it is very important to dissect the
precise mechanism of the VPRBP-USP2 axis in regulating both p53 and PD-L1 in human cancers
and provide critical insights into potential cancer treatment. In Aim1, we will elucidate the molecular
mechanism of the VPRBP/USP2 axis in regulating p53 and PD-L1 through transcription repression
and the ubiquitylation pathway. In Aim 2, will examine whether the combination of USP2 inhibitors
(or VPRBP knockdown) with the anti-PD-1 treatment is able to significantly improve the efficacy in
p53-mediated tumor growth suppression in vivo by triggering anti-tumor immunity without cause
severe toxicity."

Access to highly active antiretroviral treatment led to increased survival of people living with HIV (PLWH) in
Africa, which in turn increased their CVD burden. PLWH now experience high CVD-mortality probably due to
uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). Based on Global Burden of Disease data, Nigeria had 95% increased HTN-
related mortality from 1990 to 2015. Such high mortality could reverse the gains in survival among PLWH. In
order to prevent such reversal, strategies to control HTN in PLWH are sorely needed. However acute shortage
of healthcare workforce limits effective reduction of HTN-related morbidity. Task shifting of duties from physicians
to nurses may mitigate this systems-level barrier to HTN control. In a cluster RCT of 32 health centers in Ghana,
we showed that a nurse-led task-shifting strategy for HTN control (TASSH), based on the WHO CVD Risk
Package, led to a 34% greater reduction in systolic BP than health insurance coverage (U01HL114198; PI:
Ogedegbe). TASSH includes CV risk assessment; medication titration; and patient lifestyle counseling. Effective
strategies for implementing evidence-based interventions (EBIs) like TASSH are typically multi-level. However,
HIV clinics in Nigeria lack the expertise needed to coordinate practice changes without assistance. An
implementation strategy to overcome this barrier is practice facilitation (PF) via provision of external expertise
on practice redesign, and a tailored approach to provision of evidence-based care. PF provides expertise through
an external coach, who provides support for implementing the EBI. Although PF has been widely utilized in high
income countries, it role in translating EBIs into routine practice in Africa has not been tested. Thus, we will
evaluate the effect of PF on implementing TASSH in HIV clinics. The Lagos State Primary Healthcare Board and
its network of 67 HIV clinics provide a viable HIV chronic care platform for implementing TASSH as an integrated
model for HTN control in PLWH. Using a hybrid clinical-effectiveness implementation design, we will conduct
this study in 3 phases: 1) A pre-implementation phase using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research to tailor PF intervention for integrating TASSH into HIV clinics; 2) An implementation phase using RE-
AIM to compare in a cluster RCT of 30 HIV clinics, the effect of PF vs. a self-directed condition (i.e. receipt of
information on TASSH without PF) on BP reduction among 960 PLWH patients with HTN; and 3) A post-
implementation phase to evaluate the effect of PF vs. self-directed condition on adoption and sustainability of
TASSH. The PF intervention comprises: (a) an advisory board that will provide leadership support for TASSH
implementation; and (b) trained nurses (practice facilitators) who will serve as coaches, provide support,
knowledge exchange and performance feedback to the nurses who will deliver TASSH at the HIV clinics. Primary
outcome is change in systolic BP from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes are adoption [proportion of
patients that adopted TASSH]; sustainability [maintenance of TASSH adoption at 24 mos]; and mediators of
adoption and sustainability at 12 and 24 mos."

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a nervous system growth factor that
enhances synaptic plasticity and regulates neuronal function. BDNF gene therapy for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a promising alternative to amyloid- and tau-targeted
therapies: BDNF reduces neuronal degeneration and stimulates neuronal activity in
rodent and non-human primate models of AD. Direct injection of an Adeno-
Associated Virus (AAV) vector into entorhinal cortex mediates safe and long-lasting
BDNF expression, and will soon begin human clinical trials. Although promising,
intraparenchymal AAV-BDNF injection is invasive and treats only a small percentage
of the cerebral cortex. Intrathecal administration of AAV9-BDNF to the cerebrospinal
fluid could solve these problems by broadly treating the entire cortex from a single
minimally invasive infusion. We recently reported that two hours of Trendelenburg
positioning, in which the body lies supine on a reclining table with the head 30°
below the feet, dramatically increases the strength and consistency of gene transfer
to cerebral cortex after intrathecal AAV9 infusion in rats. More than 95% of
transduced cells in cortex are neurons, and gene expression in off-target brain
regions and spinal cord is minimal. This novel delivery method has strong potential
for clinical treatment of AD.
We propose systematic preclinical testing of intrathecal AAV9-BDNF gene therapy
for AD. Aim 1 will test therapeutic efficacy by directly comparing intrathecal and
intraparenchymal AAV9-BDNF infusion in a transgenic mouse model of AD and
analyzing behavioral and anatomical outcomes. Aim 2 will test the safety of
intrathecal AAV9-BDNF infusion at escalating doses and over prolonged treatment
periods in the non-human primate. Aim 3 will enhance the specificity of intrathecal
AAV9-BDNF therapy by testing cell-specific promoters to reduce or eliminate off-
target gene expression. These studies aim to simplify delivery, enhance efficacy, and
increase clinical feasibility of BDNF gene therapy for AD, and will support both
upcoming clinical trials and preclinical development of new gene therapies for AD."

T cells play important role in cancer cell immunosuppression. Cancer cells can interact with immune
checkpoint proteins expressed on effector T cells to cause T cell exhaustion and facilitate regulatory T
(Treg) cell suppression of effector T cells. Understanding T cell immunity is an important goal in cancer
immunotherapy. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapies have shown
tremendous promise, current immunotherapies only benefit a fraction of cancer patients, and new
approaches from mechanism-driven immune modulations are needed to broaden the therapeutic benefits
to less responsive patients. Targeting Treg cells to activate effector T cells to combat cancer is an
emerging concept in cancer immunotherapy. While systemic depletion of Treg cells can cause excessive
T cell activation leading to autoimmunity, proper induction of Treg cell instability without side effects of
autoimmune responses may open a new avenue for immune modulation. In preliminary studies, we have
found that heterozygous deletion of the Rho GTPase Cdc42 in Treg cells did not affect Treg cell
homeostasis nor result in autoimmune response but caused a destabilization of Treg cells that elicited
an anti-tumor immunity. Pharmacological targeting of Cdc42 with a small molecule inhibitor, CASIN,
mimicked Cdc42 heterozygous deletion in destabilizing Treg cells and in gaining an anti-tumor T cell
immunity. CASIN potentiated the effects of immune checkpoint inhibitors in tumor suppression without
detectable autoimmunity in mice. This project hypothesizes that the rational designed small molecules
targeting Cdc42 activity can destabilize Treg cells and modulate anti-cancer immunotherapy without
inflammatory side effects. In Aim 1, to determine the molecular pharmacology of CASIN action we will
define the mechanism of action of CASIN and improve CASIN efficacy. We will carry out further medicinal
chemistry studies, validate CASIN derivatives for proper target engagement, and examine potential
toxicity in T cells and other cell types. In Aim 2 we will demonstrate a proof of concept for CASIN or its
derivatives in targeting of Cdc42 in mouse models to trigger anti-tumor T cell immunity. We will determine
the toxicity, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CASIN and its derivatives, and examine their
preclinical efficacies in destabilizing Treg cells to elicit anti-tumor T cell immunity, alone or in combination
with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, our work will establish a novel concept and present a useful
approach for anti-cancer immunomodulation."

Homologous DNA interactions are a key determinant of chromosome structure and genome
function. In mitotic cells, pairing between sister chromatids ensures faithful chromosome
segregation and efficient chromosome break repair. In the germ line, pairing between
homologous chromosomes is a precondition for genetic exchange during meiosis, ensuring
segregation of homologous chromosomes and creation of novel allele combinations. Defects in
homologous DNA pairing contribute to chromosome missegregation and gross chromosome
rearrangements, conditions associated with cancer, premature aging and birth defects.
Moreover, allele choice for monoallelic gene expression is also thought to involve transient
interactions between homologous DNA segments. Our long-term goal is to understand the
molecular mechanism of homologous pairing and its role in chromosome structure and
function. We hypothesize that pairing preferentially occurs in genetically determined
chromosome regions separated by loops where pairing is low or absent. Our investigation
focuses on the development of a genome-wide assay for detection of homologous DNA
interactions in budding yeast as a model organism. We have developed the Homologous
Pairing Capture (HPC) assay system that allows identification of homologous DNA interactions
in intact cells, on a genome-wide scale and at nucleotide resolution. In our Specific Aim 1, we
will establish a prototype for detecting and quantitating DNA pairing interactions along
maximally paired yeast chromosomes during meiosis. We will further map preferred
associations between homologous chromosomes. In our Specific Aim 2, we will develop
approaches to quantitatively distinguish pairing interactions between similar from those
between identical DNA segments. This will enable us to distinguish pairing interactions
between homologous chromosomes from those occurring between sister chromatids. To
provide independent assay validation, we will apply HPC to branched recombination
intermediates that should correlate with known positions of genetic exchange. Identification of
preferred pairing sequences via the HPC assay will lay the foundation for a mechanistic
understanding of this ubiquitous biological process."

IgE-mediated allergic disease is a growing problem. The pathogenesis of allergic disease requires that
immunoglobulin (Ig) E (IgE) molecules be produced against what are otherwise usually innocuous substances.
Upon activation in the setting of cytokines such as IL-4 or IL-13, B cells can undergo IgH CSR to IgE. IgE
secreted from B lineage cells can, in the presence of cognate antigen, activate mast cells and basophils to
release potent inflammatory mediators. While IgE responses can lead to protective immunity as a part of a
specialized responses to multicellular pathogens or other noxious threats, they also underlie allergic disease.
Allergic disease can be manifest by localized inflammation, or by multiorgan involvement, including deadly
systemic anaphylactic reactions via IgE-sensitized mast cell degranulation. Thus, the production and
dissemination of IgE play a significant role in dictating the strength and extent of tissue mast cell sensitization.
It is therefore critical to understand not only how B cell IgE production and maturation is controlled, but also the
principles underlying distribution of IgE from point of origin to distal sites throughout the body. The overall
objective of this application is to understand biological aspects of IgE production and dissemination and to gain
insights into how this is influenced in allergic disease. Emerging literature and preliminary data from the
applicant suggest a general hypothesis that biological constraints cooperate to restrict IgE dissemination under
homeostatic conditions, and that accumulation of bone marrow IgE long-lived plasma cells is an aberrancy
underlying systemic manifestations of allergic disease. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific
aims, which are: 1) to determine the mechanisms of IgE expression dynamics on IgE B cells; 2) to elucidate
mechanisms underlying IgE distribution from point of origin to effector sites; and 3) to characterize IgE plasma
cells in allergic patients. Under the first aim, IgE mRNA splicing and IgE surface density will be genetically
perturbed to examine the hypothesis that splice bias-mediated dilute IgE BCR density limits independent IgE
GC B cell evolution potential. Under the second aim, models of anatomic location-specific allergic challenge
will be deployed to examine the degree to which IgE distribution is locally biased, and the role of naïve
bystander B cells in this process. Under the third aim, bone marrow aspirations from healthy and allergic
individuals will be obtained for IgH isotype-resolved deep sequencing as well as single cell transcriptomics to
elucidate the cellular sources and biological properties of IgE in patients with long-standing severe allergies.
This contribution is significant because it is expected to elucidate a more complete picture of how IgE
responses are regulated. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to inform the development of new
strategies that will help to reduce the growing problem of allergic disease."

Cancer metastasis accounts for over 90% of all cancer deaths. Important abilities of metastatic tumor cells
include breaking away from the primary tumor and invading into surrounding tissue before disseminating to
secondary tumor sites. Solid tumor stress caused by rapid growth of tumor cells and abnormality of the vascular
tissue has long been associated with poor prognosis of cancer. Despite the clinical importance, the basic
understanding of tumor mechanics and its relation to tumor invasion is lacking. This is in part due to the lack of
in vitro tools that are able to investigate quantitatively tumor mechanics in a physiologically relevant 3D setting.
Current material mechanical testing tools such as the rheometer have played important roles in our current
understanding of biomaterials and tumor mechanics. However, the conventional rheometer is not easily made
compatible with cell culture conditions and results are spatially averaged, masking important single cell and
molecular level information. Atomic force microscopy and pipette aspiration are cell culture compatible, but low
throughput. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a high throughput microfluidic rheometer for
systematic studies of tumor mechanics and invasion in a physiologically realistic 3D setting and compatible
with dynamic optical imaging at single cell and spheroid levels. We will deliver a set of principles that govern
tumor mechanics and its relation with invasion. We postulate that tumor mechanics is a key predictor for
tumor invasiveness. The proposed project is innovative because it represents the first generation of
microfluidic rheometers that are capable of full mechanical testing for tumor mechanics studies, and at the
same time compatible with tumor invasion experiments. Tools developed here can be easily extended to
use for other living materials, and lessons learned here will eventually lead to knowledge important for
developing novel diagnostic or/and treatment strategies for cancer."

Tumor immune exclusion predicts poor anticancer therapeutic responses and patient outcomes. The mechanical
barrier built by intercellular junction connections and extracellular matrix maintains immune exclusion in immune-
privileged organs. How such barriers dictate immune infiltration in cancer remains largely unknown. My prior
training and career goals are focused on the unmet need to comprehensively understand what mechanical
barriers are utilized by tumors, how they instigate immune exclusion to evade immune surveillance, and how to
rationally design innovative therapies that break down mechanical barriers and unleash the full potential of
antitumor immunity. Since joining the Ellisen Lab at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, I
have focused my mechanical barrier studies on the tight junction related molecule TROP2, which is
overexpressed and thought to play a role in progression of multiple cancers including aggressive triple negative
breast cancer (TNBC). Like its paralog EPCAM, TROP2 is one of a set of mechanical barrier molecules linked
to lack of tumor infiltrating immune cells. Additionally, my preliminary bioinformatic analysis shows that TROP2
has a significant negative correlation with key antitumor immune markers in multiple breast cancer cohorts. Thus,
I hypothesized that TROP2 may enforce a mechanical barrier to deter antitumor immune infiltration in breast
cancer. Importantly, TROP2 is the target protein of multiple recently developed antibody drug conjugates (ADCs)
including Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG). SG, the first FDA approved ADC for TNBC, combines a TROP2-targeted
antibody with a topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor as cytotoxic payload. While SG is proving to be a highly
successful precision therapy, its mechanisms remain poorly understood. Furthermore, the cytotoxic payload of
SG is a TOP1 inhibitor, a class of drugs known to elicit immunogenic cell death, thus providing a strong rationale
to understand mechanisms by which targeting TROP2 alone and in the context of SG will modulate tumor
immune microenvironment, thus sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors. This proposal will employ
biochemistry, mouse tumor models, genetic screens, as well as multi-omics and spatial imaging analysis of
patient specimens. The study aims to dissect the mechanism of TROP2-mediated immune exclusion in TNBC
(Aim 1); discover mechanisms of the SG/anti-PD1 combination (Aim 2), and systematically uncover novel
instigators of breast tumor immune exclusion (Aim 3). My extensive background in breast cancer immune
microenvironment and the interdisciplinary expertise of my mentor/advisors/collaborator team make me well-
suited to carry out this innovative proposal to systematically unravel tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune
exclusion. Together with the institutional support from Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School,
this award will help me gain additional knowledge and training in the area of tumor models, spatial multi-omics
analysis, and CRISPR screens, as well as career development skills which will ultimately help me to rapidly
transition to a fruitful and impactful independent research career."

Abstract  Stroke is a disabling and often fatal disease that affects all ages, but mostly in the elderly. Stroke incidence is expected to rise in the US as its population ages. Therefore, its impact on public health and health resources utilization will continue to be significant. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) has identified a need for a network of stroke clinical trial centers in order to prioritize and efficiently design and conduct exploratory (Phase II) clinical trials and confirmatory (Phase III) clinical trials to identify and advance stroke treatments. The NIH Stroke Net is a multidisciplinary stroke research infrastructure that includes a National Clinical Coordinating Center, a National Data Management Center (NDMC), 24 Regional Coordinating Centers, and the NINDS. Its mission is to develop and test new therapies for stroke treatment, recovery, and prevention that can decrease the global burden of stroke.  The NDMC’s role is to establish a collaborative relationship with all parties involved in the Network and provide efficient and standardized central data management that yields high-quality data and statistical support in the planning and execution of the stroke trials. To this end, the Data Coordination Unit (DCU) at the Medical University of South Carolina has developed a web-based comprehensive integrated electronic data capture and clinical trials management system, WebDCU™, that enables data entry from the participating clinical sites with extensive data quality control and that provides the necessary tools to efficiently manage operational activities for concurrent multiple trials, while ensuring compliance with the NINDS Common Data Elements and FDA guidance and regulations. Using the WebDCU system, we have developed, implemented, and maintained a central database that streamlines and maximizes efficiency in the management of data collection, processing, and monitoring of clinical, biomarker and neuroimaging data. In addition, the WebDCU™ incorporates a trial management information system that provides full support for all study operational activities in the Stroke Net. In collaboration with the study Principal Investigator and other parties of the Stroke Net, the NDMC biostatisticians: contribute to the innovative and efficient protocol development (including study design and case report forms development); statistically monitor study progress; generate reports for the DSMB and the study teams; conduct interim and final analysis; disseminate study results via presentations and publications; and create public use data sets for data sharing when a study is completed."

(AGOLD)”. The new descriptive title is “Health AI and Data Science in Cardiovascular and Pulmonary
Disease-Application and Bioethics (HARP-BIO)”. In this renewal, we propose to continue program focus on
impact of gender and ancestry on interpretation of omics data but will now include data sciences in general,
artificial intelligence and machine learning and how biases inherent in coding or programming of computers
and/or instruments results in biased outputs and ultimately health disparities in pulmonary and cardiovascular
diseases. This topic is well aligned with NHLBI interest areas of “Emerging technology and informatics, such as
artificial intelligence/machine learning and Integration of wearable technology in research and clinical care” and
Genomics, “populomics”, and precision health to advance the science of tailored treatment approaches for HLBS
conditions. The overall objective remains the same: to introduce scholars from under-represented backgrounds
to various omics platforms and how data sciences should be used ethically, interpreted and applied when working
with under-represented populations. This academy will be housed at the Pulmonary and Critical Care,
Cardiology Divisions of Dept of Medicine and the Department of Bioinformatics using resources available through
the Centers for Personalized Medicine and Health Artificial Intelligence as well as the Center for Bioethics and
Humanities. Over the last 4 years, AGOLD has trained 18 scholars, all underrepresented in Science or Medicine;
all scholars received small research project funds leveraged to obtain additional extramural funds as well as
peer-reviewed publications. The Pulmonary Division has a distinguished record of training leaders in pulmonary
medicine and the new Bioinformatics Department has been instrumental in elucidating to what extent genetics
can explain health disparities in complex diseases, particularly asthma. We propose a PRIDE summer academy
that will include didactic and hands-on workshops in genomics and proteomics of lung and cardiovascular
diseases, ethical use of data sciences and machine learning and introduction of the concept of academic
“coaches”. A coach is not intended to supplant the mentor, but rather guide team members through the process
of successfully navigating the academic world using well-tested social science approaches. Through 2
consecutive Summer Academies, the scholars identify a mentor and mentoring team, receive instruction on
“omics” and ethical use of data sciences and artificial intelligence, are paired with coaches who ensure that
milestones are achieved; participate in grant-writing workshops and mock study sections; implement an
evaluation plan that measures how the program is achieving its objectives. By using the combination of coaching
and social science practices such as cultural capital and communities of practice that allow team members to
feel connected with each other, we will ensure their academic persistence and ultimate success."
10808945,"Holoprosencephaly (HPE), a common malformation of the forebrain and midface, is caused by failure to define
the early rostroventral midline. HPE has a complex etiology, and is associated with both genetic and
environmental risk factors. Among the environmental factors implicated in elevated risk of HPE is prenatal
alcohol exposure. Heterozygous mutations in the Nodal and Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathways are
associated with HPE. However, clinical presentation of HPE is highly variable, and many mutation carriers are
largely unaffected. These and additional observations have led to a multifactorial model, in which the outcome
associated with a mutation is influenced by more common genetic variants and/or environmental exposures.
HPE is therefore an excellent model system for understanding gene-environment interactions and the
multifactorial etiology of many common birth defects. We have modeled this scenario in mice. CDON encodes
a multifunctional, cell surface coreceptor that promotes signaling by several pathways, including the HH
pathway. Mice with a mutation in Cdon have only a minor deficit in HH signaling but, unlike wild type mice, are
sensitive to induction of a full range of HPE defects by transient exposure to ethanol (EtOH) during early
embryogenesis. Despite many studies employing this and related models, the embryonic cell types and
developmental events that are direct targets of EtOH’s teratogenicity in HPE remain unidentified. The Nodal
pathway lies developmentally upstream from HH in rostroventral midline patterning. Our recent findings are
consistent with the hypotheses that: 1) Cdon functions cell autonomously to regulate Nodal pathway signaling
in cells of the anterior primitive streak (APS); and 2) inhibition of Nodal signaling in APS cells is the target of
synergy between fetal EtOH and Cdon mutation. To test these hypotheses, the following aims are proposed: 1)
to determine if CDON functions cell-autonomously in APS cells in EtOH-induced HPE, we will use conditional
mutagenesis to remove Cdon in the mouse APS or alternative structures and assess the sensitivity of the mice
to EtOH-induced HPE. Embryos will be analyzed at multiple stages for HPE phenotypes by morphological
analyses, in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR for alterations in gene expression, and assays for cell proliferation
and apoptosis; and 2) to determine mechanisms of EtOH action in HPE, we will study mouse epiblast stem
cells as an in vitro model for APS cells. We will study responses of these cells to EtOH by transcriptomic and
signal transduction analyses. Findings from these experiments will then be applied to studies of EtOH-treated

cured over 100,000 Veterans. Due to the high rate of comorbidities in the veteran population, including HIV co-
infection, alcohol use, and obesity and metabolic syndrome, rates of severe liver fibrosis prior to DAA therapy
are high and likely to persist despite cure. While sustained virologic response (SVR), a virologic surrogate of
HCV cure, is associated with decreased risk of hepatic decompensation (i.e., ascites, spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis (SBP), hepatic encephalopathy (HE), esophageal variceal bleed), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
and liver-related mortality, Veterans with severe liver fibrosis prior to cure remain at high risk for such events and
all-cause mortality. To date there are no reliable laboratory tests or biomarkers to differentiate patients with the
greatest risk of post-SVR decompensation events, HCC, and liver-related death. We have discovered a group
of lipid and lipid-related metabolites that accurately predict risk of liver-related complications in people with HIV
and HCV co-infection, approximately 2 years prior to the incident event. We propose to validate this biomarker
in a cohort of patients who have achieved HCV cure. Once validated, we propose to test the biomarker in a real-
world Veteran cohort to ensure generalizability. Successful validation of the metabolite profile will support
translational investigations to gain an understanding of the fundamental biology associated with the metabolites
and potential pathways for therapeutic targets of fibrosis and HCC. For Aim 1 we will validate a biosignature of
circulating lipid and lipid-related metabolites that is predictive of incident hepatic decompensation events and
HCC in patients with cirrhosis who achieve HCV cure with DAA therapy. We will conduct a nested case-control
study, leveraging a pre-existing cohort of patients with HCV and cirrhosis who achieved cure with DAA therapies
and are followed prospectively for liver-related complications. We will perform comprehensive targeted
metabolomic profiling to validate a prognostic metabolic profile. For Aim 2 we will develop integrated “clinico-
metabolic” models incorporating clinical variables and metabolite biomarkers that identify Veterans at greatest
risk of hepatic decompensation events and HCC after achieving HCV cure with DAA therapy. We will enroll
Veterans with severe liver disease into a prospective, observational study, conducted at two VA sites, after DAA-
induced HCV cure. Using a nested case-control design we will complete comprehensive targeted metabolite
profiling to develop optimized models to predict liver-related events. For Aim 3 we will use an integrated high-
dimensional biology approach of peripheral blood and liver tissue to optimize blood-based predictive models of
post-SVR incident HCC in Veterans and identify novel biologic pathways to inform future therapeutic target
development. Using liver tissue from Veterans who develop incident HCC after HCV cure with DAA therapies
we will integrate transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic profiling to identify novel biologic pathways for
which metabolite biomarkers in the plasma can be developed. This pilot study will generate knowledge of biologic
pathways that will serve as the target for disease biomarkers and novel therapeutics for future study."
10809574,"Hemodynamic neuroimaging methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revolution-
ized neuroscience by allowing researchers to characterize spatiotemporal features of brain-wide activity in hu-
mans and animals. A major disadvantage of such approaches, however, is their lack of specificity for well-defined
cellular and molecular sources; this limits their ability to yield explanatory insights into neural function. To address
this problem, we recently developed an unprecedented family of genetically encodable molecular probes, called
NOSTICs, that transduce intracellular calcium activity into artificial hemodynamic responses, permitting spatially
comprehensive neuroimaging of genetically targeted cells and circuit elements. Hemogenetic signals arising
from the NOSTICs may be differentiated from endogenous blood flow changes by pharmacological means and
can be detected by any hemodynamic imaging modality. Our preliminary experiments indicate that cell-specific
activity of even sparse neuronal populations can be identified using hemogenetic fMRI. These capabilities will
enable hemogenetic imaging to confront some of the most outstanding problems in neuroscience, such as de-
scribing functional properties of discrete cell populations on a brain-wide scale, defining input-output relation-
ships among interacting brain regions and neural circuit components, and relating behavior and activity to plas-
ticity and gene expression changes that occur throughout the brain. In this project, we will use hemogenetic
imaging to address each of these broad problems in the context of sensory function in rodents, while at the same
time refining the technology and laying a foundation for its wider application to many research topics and model
systems in neuroscience.
In Aim 1, we propose to use the technology for investigation of network-level processing in the somatosen-
sory system. Anticipated results will inform a first-of-its-kind model of multiregional stimulus processing that con-
stitutes a data-driven alternative to traditional correlative functional connectivity measures. We will use this model
to examine the importance of feedback relationships and to help explain the phenomena of sensory adaptation
and salience encoding at the network level. In Aim 2, we will exploit this capability by applying NOSTIC probes
for genetically targeted fMRI of excitatory and inhibitory neural subtypes during forepaw stimulation and resting
state dynamics in rats, addressing hypotheses about the functional roles of the different cell types. In addition,
we will apply ultrahigh resolution fMRI to examine the relationships between single vessel-level hemodynamics
and the cell type-specific distributions of NOSTIC expression, enabling a rich analysis that simultaneously in-
forms interpretation of conventional fMRI results and rigorously characterizes performance of the hemogenetic
technique itself. In Aim 3, we propose to improve the NOSTIC reporters themselves. Improvements we plan will
enhance the detectability of hemogenetic signals and give rise to hemogenetic gene reporters that will be useful
for mapping neural connectivity and plasticity in future applications."
10807270,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vineet Raghu, PhD is a computer scientist whose career goal is to improve early detection and prevention of
chronic disease by applying artificial intelligence to large datasets of medical imaging, genomics, risk factors,
and outcomes to better estimate risk and derive insight into etiology. Dr. Raghu is an Instructor of Radiology at
Harvard Medical School and research faculty at the Massachusetts General Hospital’s Cardiovascular Imaging
Research Center. In this project, he aims to develop and validate deep learning-based cardiovascular disease
risk scores from chest imaging. He will build upon his prior training in applied artificial intelligence and
genomics to gain depth of understanding in the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and preventive care of
cardiovascular disease. His specific training goals are to: 1) Gain understanding of how physicians and
patients make decisions about preventive interventions in older adults, 2) Learn to apply statistical genetics
techniques to single nucleotide polymorphism and epigenetic data to investigate molecular pathways of
cardiovascular disease, and 3) Gain deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease to
improve collaboration with physician-scientists, and 4) Develop grant writing skills and training in the
responsible conduct of research. Dr. Raghu’s training plan includes didactic training from Harvard Medical
School and Harvard School of Public Health and hands-on research training to gain the proposed skillset in
preparation for research independence. His mentorship committee has diverse expertise in imaging, deep
learning, genetics, geriatrics, and cardiovascular epidemiology to support his development. He and his
mentorship team will have individual meetings to discuss specific research aims and advisory meetings to
discuss broader career development goals. Dr. Raghu will supplement didactic training by completing the
following innovative research aims. In Aim 1, he will develop deep learning models to estimate cardiovascular
disease risk using chest CT. In Aim 2, he will identify genetic loci and biologic aging indices associated with
CT-based risk estimates. Finally, in Aim 3, he will test whether CT-based risk estimates can identify persons at
risk for incident cardiovascular events beyond current risk scores and screening criteria. These aims will be
carried out in existing large epidemiologic cohorts comprising over 70,000 individuals in total. Completion of
these aims will provide preliminary data for a potential R01 application in Years 4 and 5 to investigate whether
CT-based models improve uptake and efficacy of preventive care and reduce cardiovascular events, to expand
this approach to other imaging modalities, or to use imaging and multi-omics to identify molecular pathways of
disease. This proposal will give Dr. Raghu excellent training to achieve his goal of being an independent
investigator who develops deep learning-based risk scores and 1) collaborates with physicians to implement
such models to improve preventive care and 2) uses such models to better understand disease etiology."
10811401,"Project Summary
This proposal is prepared in response to PAR-23-041, which supports projects that functionally validate and/or
characterize genes or variants implicated in substance use disorder (SUD). We propose to illuminate the roles
of several transcript variants of rat Drd3 gene, encoding dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), in the regulation of
cocaine-seeking and taking behavior. The D3R has long been implicated in SUD and has recently become an
attractive target of pharmacotherapy of SUD. Although a few reported splice variants of Drd3 gene appear to
be conserved across species between human and rodents, their functions, especially in the context of SUD,
have not been explored previously. We have confirmed the expression of a few Drd3 transcript variants and
identified a new variant in rat ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), two brain regions
critically involved in drug reward. Some variants are expressed in a striking sex- and region-specific manner
and importantly, some are sensitive to cocaine self-administration (SA). Built on these novel observations, we
will in the R21 phase: a) characterize the function of each Drd3 variant using the heterologous expression
system; and b) develop and validate neuron type-specific AAV tools to express Drd3 variants that are sex-
specific and cocaine-sensitive. In the R33 phase, we will use the developed AAV tools to determine a) if sex-
specific Drd3 variants contribute to sex-dependent cocaine-seeking and taking behavior; b) if cocaine-sensitive
Drd3 variants regulate cocaine-seeking and taking behavior; and c) if overexpression of Drd3 variants
influences D3R function and dopamine (DA) transmission."
10811256,"As witnessed in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, inflammation-induced thrombosis could
lead to elevated disease severity, worsened clinical outcomes and increased mortality. In particular,
accumulating evidence from autopsies suggests that these thrombi are prevalent within the microvascular
of vital organs, such as the lungs, liver, kidney and heart, implying that microthrombosis may contribute to
the microvascular dysfunction and multi-organ failure in patients with severe cases of COVID-19. Although
many proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors associated with COVID-19 have been reported, how
these factors regulate the thrombosis in the microvasculature is elusive. Since the formation of
microthrombi cannot be observed directly in vivo, these is a lack of markers to assess the extent of
thrombogenesis and connect it to the clinical outcomes in time for appropriate therapeutic intervention.
In this application, we propose to develop a deep learning-enhanced multiphysics and multiscale framework
for predictive modeling of inflammation-induced thrombosis in infectious diseases. Using COVID-19 as
an initial disease model, we will examine the feasibility of using circulating cell clusters (CCCs) in the
blood samples of patients with COVID-19 as potential markers for disease prognosis. We will also
investigate the underlying mechanisms of the formation of microthrombi and CCCs as well as predict their
adverse effects in microcirculation. We propose to achieve our objectives through the following three Aims.
In Aim 1, we will develop a new deep learning model based on graph neural networks to automatically
analyze the flow cytometry images of CCCs from COVID-19 blood samples and explore the association
between CCC phenotypes and the specific clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. In Aim 2, we will
develop new deep learning models for coagulation pathways based on system-biology informed neural
networks to explore the mechanism for the activation of inflammation-induced coagulation. In Aim 3, we
will develop new multiphysics and multiscale models to simulate the formation of microthrombi and CCCs
as well as their dynamics in the microvasculature. The clinical data collected in Aim 1 will be used to
inform the computational models in Aims2&3 whereas Aims2&3 will provide mechanistic rationale for
findings in Aim 1 and offer insight for new treatment strategies.
In summary, the proposed predictive multiphysics and multiscale computational framework will provide
new computational and modeling tools to improve disease prognosis for COVID-19, elucidate the
pathogenesis of inflammation-induced thrombosis, identify the potential key factors that regulate the
thrombogenesis, thereby opening new avenues for developing more effective and tailored antithrombotic
treatments for hyperinflammatory prothrombotic disorders in various infectious diseases."
10832121,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Anxiety and depression are highly debilitating mental health disorders with origins in early life, making
research in children and adolescents a critical public health need. The prevalence of both disorders in this
age group has rapidly increased over the past decade, particularly in urban areas. Though the etiologies of
child and adolescent mental health disorders remain poorly understood, increasing trends over mere
decades point to environmental causes more than genetics. We propose that non-chemical stressors (noise,
violence, negative life events, and neighborhood environment) in the urban environment play a major role
and interact with environmental factors that show strong urban-rural gradients, such as air pollution. The
neurocognitive toxicity of air pollution has been intensely studied in animal and epidemiologic research but
its role in anxiety and depression is poorly understood, with only a few studies in adults, and even less in
younger populations. Further, the mechanisms by which air pollution impacts the brain are poorly
understood, although altered functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its role in
regulating cortisol secretion is a prime candidate. This study will determine whether early life PM2.5 and non-
chemical stressors impact symptoms of depression and anxiety in preadolescence/ late childhood and
whether cortisol mediates and/or modifies these relationships. We will leverage resources from an
established longitudinal birth cohort in Mexico City - Programming Research in Obesity, Growth,
Environment and Social Stress (PROGRESS). Specifically, we will examine time-specific and cumulative
PM2.5 exposure in relation to mental health outcomes in 8-11 year olds (Aim 1), the role of individual and
combined urban non-chemical stressors in relation to mental health symptoms (Aim 2), and the role of hair
cortisol levels on the biological pathway from PM2.5 to mental health symptoms (Aim 3). In order to more
comprehensively characterize urban stressors in environmental epidemiology and assess their impacts on
mental health in preadolescents, I will cross-train in child and adolescent psychopathology and enhance my
skills in geospatial modeling. I will additionally train in advanced statistical mixtures and causal mediation to
better characterize biological pathways from PM2.5 and stress to mental health outcomes. I will develop these
skills through didactic training, independent study, and mentorship from experts in developmental
psychology, pediatrics, geography, social epidemiology, and biostatistics, specifically - Drs. Rosalind Wright,
Robert Wright, Itai Kloog, Daniel Klein, and Brent Coull. At the end of this training period, I will be uniquely
positioned to more comprehensively examine the effectsof multiple urban stressors on mental health
outcomes in future research. Further, I will use the knowledge gained and the noise model I develop in future
grants, setting the stage for my long-term goal of studying the effects of chemical and non-chemical
stressors in the urban environment on brain development and mental health outcomes across the life course."
10932975,"Project Summary
The opioid crisis is dynamic. To overcome barriers to addiction treatment, implementation research must keep
pace with the changing landscape of the opioid crisis by more rapidly adapting to emerging evidence. Clinical
decision support (CDS) offers a promising implementation strategy to more efficiently operationalize and scale
evidence-based practices. Patients are motivated to initiate addiction treatment after sentinel events, such as
an emergency department (ED) visit for opioid overdose. Unfortunately, clinicians rarely initiate addiction
treatment. To that end, we recently conducted the EMBED pragmatic cluster-randomized trial. This trial
evaluated the effectiveness of non-interruptive electronic health record (EHR)-based CDS to facilitate patient
assessment and automate EHR activities to implement ED-initiation of buprenorphine in the routine care of
people with opioid use disorder (OUD). The EMBED CDS increased the proportion of physicians who initiated
buprenorphine leading to national dissemination of EMBED. Post-trial analysis identified disparities in
treatment as well as opportunities to increase reach and adoption. However, CDS interventions typically
remain unchanged while being studied and traditional methods for evaluation are time-consuming, resulting in
missed opportunities for progress and delays in implementing effective interventions. These limitations must be
addressed to speed the implementation of evidence-based solutions to the opioid crisis in general and the the
nationally scaled EMBED CDS specifically. The EHR can both deliver CDS interventions and offer a non-
obtrusive, rigorous way to study care delivery at scale utilizing EHR use measurement with automated log data
capture. Current quantitative CDS use and usability metrics are limited to alert dismissal rates and descriptive
measures of CDS characteristics but are not capable of evaluating CDS interfaces and workflows such as
granular assessment of CDS uptake and usability. Therefore, we will adapt CDS of best practices in the care of
people with OUD using a Multiphase Optimization STrategy (MOST) framework including rapid, serial
randomized testing, measured by scalable, pragmatic EHR use metrics to achieve the following specific aims:
(1) Refine and validate reproducible, scalable outcome measures for assessing CDS uptake and usability to
implement ED-initiation of buprenorphine for OUD and (2) Refine and evaluate a multicomponent CDS
intervention to improve ED-initiation of buprenorphine in patients with OUD via increased CDS uptake,
usability, and equity. Achievement of these specific aims will offer a pathway to scalable, equitable
interventions for the opioid crisis by innovating data-driven, adaptive approaches that increase treatment
access and engagement for people with OUD. With expertise in emergency medicine, addiction medicine,
clinical decision support, pragmatic evaluation, biostatistics, health equity, and data, measurement, and
implementation science, Dr. Melnick and the ADAPT team are uniquely poised to achieve these aims."
10813163,"Project Summary/Abstract
The signaling network involving Ras GTPases and their downstream effectors, particularly the
PI3K and MAPK/ERK pathways, plays important roles in diverse cellular processes including
proliferation, metabolism, migration, and survival. Derangements of the signaling network leads
to diseases such as developmental anomalies, metabolic disorders, and cancer. Despite its
clinical importance, targeting the Ras signaling network for disease treatment has been
challenging due to an incomplete understanding of its complex regulation. Recent studies of the
Ras signaling dynamics at the single-cell level revealed fascinating properties with important
functional implications. In particular, we demonstrated that the Ras signaling network displays
hallmarks of excitable systems such as stochastic activation, traveling waves, and all-or-none
activation. The excitability of the Ras-PI3K-ERK signaling network plays important roles in cell
motility and integration of chemical and mechanical stimuli that regulate cell proliferation.
However, the overall structure of the Ras signaling network that encodes the excitable dynamics
is not known. The purpose of this application is to analyze the structure of the Ras signaling
network by systematically perturbing individual nodes and studying the effects on the excitable
dynamics of the network. To this end we will develop a method based on fluorescent live cell
imaging to simultaneously track a large number of signaling activities. We will use this method
to monitor the excitable responses of ~30 signaling activities when each activity is
pharmacologically inhibited. The effects of perturbations will provide insight into the regulatory
relationship between the signaling activities. We will also carry out network analysis on different
cell types to understand the basis of their distinct responses to small molecule inhibitors. These
studies will pave the way for quantitative models containing sufficient details of the network to
make accurate predictions of cellular responses."

The goal of the proposed five-year training program is to support the development of the applicant's independent
research career as an academic pediatric infectious diseases doctor focused on host-directed therapeutics for
multidrug-resistant pathogens. The applicant completed medical school at Stanford University School of
Medicine, pediatrics residency training at Boston Children's Hospital/Harvard Medical School and is currently
completing her fellowship training in pediatric infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia
(CHOP), with the plan to transition to faculty at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) in 2020. The
candidate's goals are to develop and refine the essential skills that will be required for a successful career as an
independent investigator. The candidate specifically seeks to gain expertise in murine models of infection,
bacterial genetics, genomics and advanced fluorescence microscopy to augment her research skills in
immunology. Her long-term goal is to investigate and develop immune based treatment and therapeutic
strategies to improve treatment paradigms and clinical outcomes for patients with highly drug-resistant infections.
The mentor for this award is Professor Victor Nizet, an eminent physician-scientist and established leader in
junior faculty development, innate immunology and experimental therapeutics. To add depth and breadth to the
scientific and career guidance of the applicant, a Mentoring Committee is composed of scientists and physician-
scientists from diverse and complementary fields. Dr. Ulloa will also benefit from the unparalleled resources and
the unique, interdisciplinary working groups at UCSD including the Center for Immunity, Infection & Inflammation;
the Center for Drug Discovery and Innovation; and the Collaborative to Halt Antibiotic-Resistant Microbes.
The applicant's proposal is relevant to the U.S. National Action Plan to combat the increasing prevalence of
drug-resistant pathogens that threaten our ability to manage life-threatening bacterial infections, and that pose
significant challenges in balancing the efficacy and toxicity of potential antibiotic therapies. A solution proposed
herein is to repurpose drugs that increase the antibacterial efficiency of important innate immune components.
The foundation for this proposal is based on the candidate's first-author manuscript that describes how multidrug-
resistant bacteria are sensitized to killing by the innate immune system in the presence of β-lactamase inhibitors,
despite prevailing logic predicting this monotherapy to be fruitless. The mechanisms for such synergy and its
therapeutic potential in vivo remain to be elucidated. The aims of this proposal are 1) to identify the mechanistic
basis for β-lactamase inhibitor and antimicrobial peptide synergy, and 2) to investigate the therapeutic impact of
β-lactamase inhibitors in vivo. These studies will provide a rationale for repurposing certain FDA-approved drugs,
with known safety and tolerability, as adjunctive immunotherapies for the treatment of drug-resistant infections."
10814263,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Access to high-quality auditory input is crucial for successful speech and language development. Hearing losses
caused by Auditory Neuropathy (AN) or Cochlear Hearing Loss (C-HL) degrade the auditory signal, but in
different ways. After accounting for audibility, listeners with C-HL often exhibit normal or near-normal temporal
resolution accompanied by impaired spectral resolution. Many listeners with AN display poor temporal resolution.
This is important because differences in a listener’s access to timing and frequency cues can affect sensitivity to
acoustic-phonetic cues that support both language acquisition and speech perception. The proposed research
will evaluate the short-term and long-term effects of degraded spectral and temporal resolution on speech
perception and phonological awareness in children with AN and C-HL compared to children with normal hearing.
Evaluation will involve psychophysical tests of spectral and temporal resolution as well as speech perception for
words in which recognition relies on either vowel or consonant perception. The training plan outlined in this
fellowship proposal includes skill development in the areas of research design, signal detection, speech
perception, language development, statistical modeling, professional network development, and ethical conduct
of research. The combined resources of The University of North Carolina and Boys Town National Research
Hospital provide unique opportunities for technical training and career development, in addition to unparalleled
models of the successful integration of clinical and research endeavors."

Infrastructures and Learning Systems (HILS) MS and PhD program(s) that are embedded in DLHS. Initiated in
2016, HILS remains the 1st and only masters and doctoral program in learning health systems in the country.
The overarching goal of the REC is to provide a training and mentoring mechanism leading to enduring careers
for LHS scientists with a specific emphasis on novel approaches to promote equity and inclusion in the LHS
workforce. More specifically, we will support LHS scientists to work and collaborate with local, regional, and
national groups to build coalitions and leverage existing socio-technical infrastructures necessary for
transformations in health systems, community organizations, and broader policies. Cohorts of diverse
scholars from multiple disciplines will learn together and focus on the skills and content knowledge
needed to promulgate careers as learning health scientists. For MEL-STaR predoctoral scholars, the REC
will support matriculation through the 36-credit hour HILS PhD program, incorporating didactic and experiential
leaning, rapid cycle, student-centered mentoring and feedback, and a commitment to diversity, equity,
inclusion, and social justice. For MEL-STaR postdoctoral scholars, the REC will utilize the well-tested and
effective infrastructure of the DLHS Medical Education Scholars Program (MESP), an internationally acclaimed
annual program that trained over 300 faculty and fellows at the University of Michigan. The REC will provide
the infrastructure for early career faculty and fellows to develop as leaders in LHS by providing didactic and
experiential learning opportunities through HILS and the embedded MEL-STaR labs. The overarching goal of
the REC will be accomplished through promoting four main components of effective patient-centered, cross-
sectoral research and infrastructure: 1) mentorship for rapid cycle research in learning health systems; 2)
engagement with systems, community, and stakeholder partners; 3) mechanisms to leverage grant funding
from federal and non-federal agencies; and 4) use of existing information systems and emerging data to
support PCOR/CER."

11146202,"SUMMARY
Adolescents are at increasing risk of overdose death. Since 2020, the overdose crisis has expanded most rapidly
among younger populations, largely because of the recent reality that any illicit substance (e.g., counterfeit
pharmaceuticals, methamphetamines) used by adolescents has the potential to contain lethal amounts of
fentanyl. Preventing overdose deaths will require identifying and treating youth with any substance use disorder
(SUD) or occasional opioid use – including but not limited to opioid use disorder (OUD) – due to potential fentanyl
contamination. Access to experienced, qualified SUD/OUD treatment providers for adolescents is far below what
is needed, with an even greater disparity noted than for adults needing treatment. Adding specialists to the
workforce will help, but the urgency of the national overdose crisis requires innovative changes to current
adolescent SUD/OUD care models to improve availability of effective assessment and treatment services.
Primary Care Providers (PCPs) could fill a portion of the gap of the behavioral health workforce, but they often
lack formal SUD training and resources and feel unqualified to diagnose and treat SUDs, particularly in youth.
Integrated care models, where PCPs work closely with behavioral health specialists to deliver appropriate care
to patients with SUD/OUD, are a promising but understudied approach in pediatric contexts. Therefore, with
input from national experts and local stakeholders, the research team will conduct a Hybrid Type 2 effectiveness-
implementation, cluster-randomized trial to study a multifaceted intervention to change the procedural and
cultural norms of pediatric primary settings. This project capitalizes on the infrastructure established through a
large-scale roll out of integrated behavioral health (IBH) in a statewide health system. Intervention components
for this adolescent SUD IBH include task-shifting within primary care to facilitate delivery of brief SUD
interventions, case management, electronic decision support tools, and stigma-reduction interventions. The
primary purpose of the proposed intervention is to formally combine and build on the resources available through
these interventions to shift primary care practice toward delivering effective adolescent SUD care and, ultimately,
to prevent overdose deaths among adolescents."
10812737,"ABSTRACT
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is typically described as a disorder of childhood; however, challenges in
socioemotional behavior and cognition persist across the lifespan. Nearly 6 million adults in the United States
currently live with ASD, with prevalence more than doubling in the last 10 years. Recent studies suggest that
adults with ASD are twice as likely to develop dementia, and have an increased prevalence of age-related
physical and psychiatric conditions. While brain and behavioral differences are well researched in children with
ASD, a major gap in knowledge exists for the adult brain. The brains of individuals with ASD undergo an
atypical developmental trajectory, marked by initial excess in volume, neuron density, and connectivity in
childhood that is followed by a progressive reduction in cell number, myelin thickness, and synapses into
adulthood. We propose that early neuronal excess and local over-connectivity, in concert with systemic
neuroimmune dysregulation, may render the ASD brain vulnerable to age-related pathological and pro-
inflammatory processes beginning in early adulthood that may ultimately lead to cellular dysfunction and later
cognitive decline. Here we aim to determine the cell types affected as individuals with ASD age through
adulthood and identify neuroinflammatory markers specific to those cells. We will utilize a unique sample of
clinically and genetically characterized human postmortem adult brains, examining regions implicated in the
socioemotional and neurobiological impairments of ASD and aging. We hypothesize that aberrant immune
activation of pro-inflammatory processes contribute to the altered trajectory of brain development, as well as
deleterious neuropathogenic protein aggregations associated with cognitive decline. We will utilize unbiased
transcriptomic methods to determine which genes may be differentially expressed in specific cell groups, and
assays to determine which proteins, including cytokines, may be disproportionately affected with age in ASD
(Aim 1). Informed by these results, we will carry out a systematic examination of the expression of high-priority
markers in specific cell types with preserved spatial information in brain tissue sections (Aim 2). Finally, we will
examine the effects of neuroinflammation and aging in ASD on the synaptic connections between neurons
(Aim 3). These critical, discovery-driven studies will serve as an essential first step to characterize cellular and
molecular processes associated with brain aging in ASD, and provide a fundamental platform upon which
mechanistic studies and animal models can be built. This project will define the neuropathological features
associated with brain aging in ASD and correlate these variables with extensive clinical and genetic information
for each subject, in support of precision medicine. Ultimately, we aim to shift the mindset of autism research
toward the view of adulthood not as an endpoint, but as part of a trajectory of brain development across the
lifespan, with the goal of promoting healthy aging in the rapidly growing population of adults living with ASD."

The University of Michigan (U-M) Department of Learning Health Sciences (DLHS) proposes to establish an
embedded Learning Health System scientist training and research (“MEL-STaR”) center to support the didactic
and experiential training of embedded learning health system scientists focused on principles of patient
centeredness to improve patient outcomes and experience, health system operations, quality, and health
equity. MEL-STaR Scholars will be embedded in settings (“labs”) where LHS activity is ongoing. These labs
include U-M departments, statewide Collaborative Quality Initiatives, VA centers for quality improvement,
networks of federally qualified health centers, and the PaTH network of PCORnet. DLHS’ multi-disciplinary MS
and PhD program in Health Infrastructures and Learning Systems (HILS), started in 2016, is predicated on the
AHRQ LHS competencies, and remains the only predoctoral LHS-focused degree program in the US. HILS
trainees (40 currently enrolled and 25 graduates) blend coursework in informatics, implementation science,
analytics, and health policy and ethics with an embedded, ‘real-world’ practicum spanning a wide range of
health problems and domains related to LHS. An online HILS MS program was launched in 2021. The
proposed MEL-STaR center is structured around three cores: Administrative, Research and Education (REC),
and Research and Data Analysis (RDAC). The Administrative Core will carry out management, coordination,
and communication functions of the center. A Patient Engagement and Health Equity Catalyst (PEHEC) will be
embedded in the Administrative Core to ensure all aspects of the center include authentic, ongoing stakeholder
engagement, patient-centeredness, and an intentional focus on advancing health equity. The Catalyst will work
with all cores and labs to shape how scholars are selected, trained, what research they focus on, and the
methods they use to optimize both patient-centeredness and health equity in their training and ultimately in
their research careers. Similarly, a Program Evaluation Unit will also be embedded in the Administrative Core
to design and conduct evaluation with clear impact metrics linked to improvements in health system
performance and patient centered outcomes. The REC will support designated “MEL-STaR Scholars” in
didactic and experiential embedded experiences, enabling them to function professionally as LHS scientists
who will transform health systems in ways necessary to improve health and healthcare. The RDAC will provide
resources to enrich the embedded experiences of the MEL-STaR Scholars and a broader range of LHS-related
research activities through advanced resources that reflect the expertise and achievements of U-M faculty.
The three integrated cores--built on nine years of DLHS activity as an academic department, seven years of
operation of the HILS degree program grounded in the AHRQ competencies, and the robust activities of the
“labs” as homes to embedded experiences--will achieve the goals of the MEL-STaR center program at the
highest level."

equity. Specific Aim 1 of the AC is to provide overall executive management and operational governance for
the Center. These functions will reside in the Center Leadership Team and the Operating Committee. The
Operating Committee will include the Co-Directors of the Research and Education (REC) and Research and
Data Analysis (RDAC) Cores, as well as the Co-Leads of the Patient Engagement and Health Equity Catalyst
(PEHEC) and the Co-Leads of the Program Evaluation Unit. The Operating Committee will collaborate across
all components of the Center to ensure that MEL-STaR fulfills all administrative requirements. The LHS
Collaboratory Steering Committee, comprising the embedded research labs, will play an advisory role to the
program leaders in shaping the activities of MEL-STaR. Specific Aim 2 of the AC is to conduct coordination
and communication functions essential to the program’s success. The Leadership Team will communicate with
the AHRQ and PCORI program staff as informed by the Operating Committee. An annual in-person “All MEL-
STaR” Symposium will bring together the entire Center. The Symposium will include: current and past
Scholars, all personnel associated with the Center and its Cores and other operating units; and all members of
the LHS Collaboratory Steering Committee. Specific Aim 3 of the AC is to ensure that all didactic and
experiential activities are conducted in accord with principles of health equity, patient engagement, and the
LHS Core Values. The PEHEC will ensure that all aspects of the MEL-STAR program include authentic,
ongoing stakeholder engagement, patient-centeredness, and an intentional focus on advancing health equity.
The PEHEC, a diverse group representing multiple perspectives, will work closely with the REC and the RDAC
to achieve its mission. AC Specific Aim 4 is to conduct ongoing monitoring and evaluation of program activities.
The Program Evaluation Unit will conduct studies throughout the project period, operating in annual cycles,
with each cycle terminating at the MEL-STaR Symposium where study results and proposed adaptations will
be presented, further discussed, and refined by all program participants at the Symposium. As MEL-STaR is
profoundly linked to the mission of the Department of Learning Health Sciences (DLHS), the existing External
Advisory Committee to DLHS will also serve as the External Advisory Committee for MEL-STaR. AC Specific
Aim 5 is to integrate MEL-STaR activities with those of the LHS Collaboratory. The LHS Collaboratory serves
as a hub for LHS activity across the entire University of Michigan campus. All Collaboratory activities are also
open to the general public, and all public facing activities of the Collaboratory will be co-branded with MEL-
STaR. The REC’s educational services and the RDAC’s research support services will also be available to
Collaboratory member projects."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly lethal malignancy and is the major form of pancreatic
cancer. With an incidence on the rise, it currently ranks as the third leading cause of cancer death in the US.
Despite recent advances in the understanding of its biology, genetics and risk factors, PDAC has maintained
extremely poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of only 10%. This mainly stems from its late diagnosis,
aggressive nature and resistance to therapies. Thus, novel therapeutic approaches are urgently needed.
Targeting altered metabolism in PDAC has been an area of extensive investigation for over a decade now. A
major hurdle however, for most anti-tumor metabolic strategies, is the high risk of toxic side effects, given the
essential roles of metabolic pathways in the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis. This has indeed been
the case for targeting polyamines in cancers. Polyamines are small, highly positively charged molecules
involved in multiple fundamental processes of cell growth and survival, including the synthesis of nucleic acids,
modifications of chromatin structure, gene transcription and mRNA translation. Polyamine levels are
significantly increased in many cancers, including PDAC. Prior anti-tumor strategies focused on
pharmacological inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme of polyamine synthesis, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1)
with little success, partially due to risk of harming normal tissues at higher drug doses. This project identifies
and aims at validating a dependency of pancreatic cancer, both in cultured cells in vitro and in mice in vivo, on
an unconventional way for the synthesis of the polyamine precursor ornithine, specifically from glutamine via
ornithine aminotransferase (OAT); this is compared to its synthesis in most adult normal tissues from arginine
via arginase (ARG) activity. It also aims at identifying potential key players mediating the induction of this
metabolic pathway by KRAS, the main oncogenic driver in PDAC, and to characterize the downstream effects
of polyamines on transcriptional activation and gene expression in PDAC cells compared to normal pancreatic
cells. The high dependency of PDAC, but not normal tissues on de novo ornithine synthesis from glutamine
provides an attractive therapeutic window for treating pancreatic cancer patients with minimal toxicity."

Neuroinflammation is a significant contributor to most CNS disorders including neurodegenerative
diseases and psychological disorders. A hallmark of neuroinflammation is the increased expression of the
proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the brain. How IL-1 causes neuro- and psycho-
pathologies is poorly understood. We have recently discovered that the receptor for IL-1, IL-1R1, is
expressed in specific sets of neurons in the brain. These neuronal IL-1R1s, nIL-1R1, modulate neuronal
activity via non-canonical signaling pathways to alter neuronal function and circuit connectivity. This
application is designed to: 1) map nIL-1R1 distribution in the brain, 2)demonstrate the involvement of
nIL-1R1 in neuroinflammation induced behavioral deficits and neuropathology, and 3) elucidate the
mechanisms of nIL-1R1 mediated neuromodulation."
10817955,"Platelets are specialized anucleate cells that play an essential role in hemostasis, angiogenesis, immunity, and
inflammation. Thrombocytopenia (platelet counts <150x109/L) is a major clinical problem encountered across a
number of conditions including immune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura, myelodysplastic syndromes,
chemotherapy, surgery, and genetic disorders. The demand for platelets—and for an improved understanding
of their mechanistic formation—is at an all-time high. This program will use a multi-prong approach to
investigate megakaryocytes (MKs) to discover therapeutic strategies and molecular targets that drive
proplatelet formation and increase platelet counts. MKs are precursor cells that generate platelets by
remodeling their cytoplasm into beaded proplatelet processes, which function as the assembly lines for platelet
production. While we know that cytoskeletal mechanics power platelet production, many questions about
platelet biogenesis remain unanswered. We know that microtubule-based forces are critical for proplatelet
elongation; however, there is a surprising lack of understanding of the mechanisms that trigger platelet
production. We hypothesize that centrosome regulation, via super spindle formation and KIFC1 motor
involvement, is critical for the initiation of platelet production. We will use a novel high-content microscopy
screen to identify the small molecules and signaling pathways that drive platelet production. Using proplatelet
image analysis, we will test thousands of drug molecule candidates for their ability to stimulate or inhibit
platelet production; target pathway analysis, secondary screens, and dose-response curves will be established
to identify compound “hits.” While we know that proplatelet protrusions extend from bone marrow, breach the
endothelial barrier, and deposit platelets into the blood, we do not know how. Therefore, we will employ bio-
engineering and a unique microfluidic bone marrow on-a-chip to test the idea that actin-driven megakaryocyte
podosomes provide a mechanism to penetrate the endothelium. This chip will also be used to study how
organelles are transported into assembling platelets under physiological conditions, and to test the hypothesis
that super spindle assembly functions as a major transport hub for distributing these organelles. We will
determine if vascular thiol isomerases play a role in new platelet granule biology through investigating how
they are packaged, transported, and exocytosed from platelets. We expect that findings from this
investigation will 1) advance the understanding of the mechanisms that initiate and regulate platelet
formation, and 2) identify novel therapeutic targets and approaches to accelerate platelet production in
patients with thrombocytopenia. The R35 structure is necessary given the relative immaturity of the MK field
and will provide vital time and focus to expanding the current base of knowledge. This proposal will coordinate
a diverse group of collaborators, provide the field with novel data and theory, and support junior scientists with
consistent mentorship and proven leadership from a laboratory with broad ranging translational experience."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is the most prevalent substance use disorder worldwide and often co-occurs with
chronic pain, anxiety, depression, and opioid dependence. Unfortunately, currently available medications for
AUD have limited efficacy with unwanted side effects. To address this unmet medical need, we propose an SBIR
Phase I U43 project in response to PAR-22-102 ""Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling and Early-Stage
Development of Medications to Treat Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-Associated Organ Damage."" Our project
will focus on proof-of-concept studies of our active IND (157314), AFA-281, a novel dual inhibitor of T-type
calcium channels (Cav3) and soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), for AUD treatment. These proof-of-concept
studies would use well-established rodent AUD models and testing paradigms.
AfaSci discovered AFA-281 from a series of patented dual modulators of Cav3 channels and sEH as a non-
opioid analgesic. We completed lead identification through rational drug design and iterative screenings using
patch-clamp recordings and enzymatic assays. Lead optimization was conducted, including selectivity screening
on hERG and key cardiac ion channels, and CEREP proofing of 81 off-drug targets. These screenings together
with studies using human cardiomyocytes ex vitro demonstrated that AFA-281 has no cardiac safety concerns.
In pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) studies, AFA-281 has shown excellent oral bioavailability,
acceptable t1/2, CNS penetration, broad analgesic effects on neuropathic and inflammatory pain, and good safety
margins. Recently, AFA-281's IND application was accepted by the FDA for a lead indication of neuropathic pain.
Our preliminary studies on AUD have demonstrated that AFA-281 is capable of decreasing alcohol intake, binge
drinking and preference, and suppressing alcohol-seeking behavior in rodents.
In this proposed SBIR Phase I U43 project, we will conduct preclinical proof-of-concept studies to investigate
AFA-281's effects on AUD, and its associated chronic pain and negative affective disorders, such as anxiety and
depression in rats via three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will evaluate PK/PD of AFA-281 in reducing alcohol consuming
and seeking behavior via operant self-administration. Aim 2 will investigate AFA-281's effects on hyperalgesia,
anxiety, and depression in rats withdrawn from chronic alcohol consumption. Aim 3 will explore the mechanism
of action of AFA-281 underlying its efficacy in AUD via assessing AFA-281’s modulation on alcohol-altered neural
activity indicated by c-Fos expression and brain neuroinflammation, and evaluation of Cav3 channel activity, and
cell excitability in the lateral habenula, a brain area implicated in AUD.
Success in our Phase I project would demonstrate that AFA-281 can reduce alcohol consumption and seeking
behavior, provide an evidence base to prepare for the transition to clinical proof-of-concept studies in the U44
SBIR project. Given the significant public health burden of AUD, developing a more effective and safe medication
accessible for treatment and prevention of AUD would have a considerable positive impact on public health."

This K99/R00 application describes the background and experience of the applicant, Rachel Wells, PhD, RN,
and her plan to acquire the knowledge and training necessary to become a leading independent clinical
investigator in developing and testing early palliative care interventions that optimize the outcomes of
underserved individuals living with advanced heart failure (HF). This training and proposed research are of
importance because: 1) substantial unmet palliative care needs of persons living with advanced HF; 2) few
investigators are examining the mechanisms underlying palliative care intervention components to optimize
intervention effect; and 3) the development of efficacious and scalable palliative care interventions in HF is a
key research priority. The overall K99 goals are to gain advanced research training in developing behavioral
interventions, conducting randomized controlled trials using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), and
advanced research ethics to refine and pilot test components of a lay navigator-led early palliative care
intervention for underserved persons with advanced HF in the Southern U.S. The goal of the UPHOLDS
intervention (Utilizing Palliative Care for Heart Failure Optimized using Lay Navigators to Decrease Suffering),
will be to improve quality of life (QOL) by activating advanced HF patients through trained lay navigators
coaching. The specific training objectives during the K99 phase are to: (1) develop and tailor interventions that
are: 1a) manualized with rigorous fidelity procedures for enhanced replication and scalability; 1b) tailored to
underserved populations; and 1c) led by lay navigators; (2) develop skills to design and lead RCTs using the
MOST framework; and (3) continue training in research ethics. A comprehensive training plan has been
developed in concert with mentorship team of senior research experts and includes intensive face-to-face
mentorship, formal coursework/workshops, clinical trial observerships, and conference attendance. The K99
research aim will be met using interviews with a) underserved persons with advanced HF, b) lay healthcare
navigators, and c) palliative care and HF clinicians, to modify and refine the content, format and delivery of HF
palliative care intervention components. The overall goal during the R00 phase is to conduct an optimization
pilot using a 23 factorial design to assess acceptability, feasibility, and potential efficacy of the newly refined
UPHOLDS intervention. The research specific aims during the R00 phase are to: 1) determine the feasibility
and acceptability of using a highly innovative MOST factorial design approach to enroll and retain 40 advanced
HF patients for 24 weeks and 2) explore the preliminary efficacy of individual intervention components and
component interactions on patient outcomes (QOL, primary outcome) at 12- and 24- weeks after baseline. The
results will directly support an R01 application to conduct a fully powered MOST factorial trial to test the effects
of individual palliative care intervention components on advanced HF patient outcomes."
10821491,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and human toll of extreme weather events such as
floods and hurricanes. Children living in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly
vulnerable to the health impacts of these disasters because many live in areas that lack the resources to
mitigate, respond to, and recover from the devastation. Children might also be particularly sensitive to the
indirect health effects from disasters—morbidity and mortality due to compromised conditions such as
food security and clean water—as their health is more vulnerable to shocks. However, these indirect
effects are typically not included in the estimates of disaster deaths. Getting estimates of the indirect
burden of disasters on child health is therefore central for designing mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Recent evidence from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico suggests that indirect mortality impacts could far
outweigh the direct effects. In the proposed project we aim to improve measurement of the direct and
indirect child mortality burden of floods and storms (i.e., hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons) in over 50
LMICs. These disaster types are particularly impacted by climate change and have a devastating human
toll. Specifically, we propose to (i) catalog the precise location and intensity of storms and floods in
Africa, Asia, and Latin America; (ii) link disaster events to child health records, (iii) estimate the impact
of these disasters on child mortality; and (iv) study the mechanisms and behaviors that contribute to
disaster related mortality, which will help inform mitigation strategies. This study will provide the first
wide-spanning empirical evidence of the indirect impacts of some of the most harmful disasters on child
health in LMICs. Our results will guide efforts to mitigate the consequences from these tragic events."
10819045,"Abstract
As currently practiced, ultrasound imaging, recognized universally as being of great health care importance,
requires the operator to have considerable training and anatomic and medical image understanding. Access to
low-cost imaging services for millions of patients in-home, rural areas and clinics is restricted due to the lack of
experienced sonographers and clinicians who can effectively acquire high quality scans. Sonovance, a
Maryland small business, is addressing this need by developing a low-cost system for operators with no prior
training to acquire diagnostic ultrasound images with standard and portable systems and probes, including
mobile devices. The approach uses a simple geometric model to represent the imaging target region, a
position sensor to report the location and orientation of the probe, and a calibration procedure by which to co-
register the target region to the patient. The user interface guides the operator’s positioning of the probe to
acquire 2D images that intersect the target region, providing continuous visual feedback as to which regions
require additional scanning without requiring the user to view the images themselves. The system reconstructs
these images into a rectangular 3D image volume covering the target region. Sonovance has completed a
prototype system using a standard Interson probe and an attached electromagnetic sensor to capture position
information which has been shown to successfully capture and reconstruct 3D images at prescribed locations
on an abdominal phantom.
Two key aims are to be addressed to accomplish the overall goal of arriving at a low-cost and clinically useful
prototype from the current one validated on a phantom. Aim 1 is to optimize and validate the company’s
patented system for guiding unskilled operators to obtain acceptable diagnostic ultrasound images of the
kidneys in human patients. Aim 2 is to further reduce the system cost by employing low-cost inertial position
sensors and implementing an image reconstruction method based on a statistical image model with position
correction to address the reduced accuracy of the positional data. The two goals are independent of each other
and can be developed in parallel. Following successful proof of concept in this study, Phase II research will
focus on clinical trials to evaluate and optimize the accuracy and usability of the system by novice users for
kidney and urinary tract ultrasound imaging. The overall goal of the program is to develop the software into a
product deployable worldwide and build out a “full body” of clinical scanning protocols that can be delivered
with the technology. Health systems will be able to deploy novice user scanning with existing AI solutions to
assist in diagnostic interpretation based on the patient population. The clinical imaging protocols can be
developed by Sonovance, or others via APIs, and will include abdominal, cardiac, Doppler, and OB-GYN. This
research aligns with NIBIB’s mission to support ultrasound image acquisition and display as well as innovative
signal processing and supports the mission of the Point of Care Technologies Network (POCTRN)."

10821399,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Novel therapeutic approaches to minimize neurovascular injury in stroke are needed. The cerebrovascular
endothelium not only plays a critical role in blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption and exacerbation of neuronal
injury but it also has a great therapeutic potential. However, the limited understanding of the endothelial
specific molecular mechanisms involved in BBB disruption restricts progress towards developing novel
therapeutic approaches specifically targeting the endothelium in stroke. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is
highly abundant in plasma, and is a potent modulator of endothelial function via its receptors (S1PR). We and
others have shown that S1P via S1PR1 promotes endothelial barrier function in a Gi- phosphatidylinositol-3-
kinase-(PI3K)-Akt dependent way in various organs. In sharp contrast, we found that S1PR2 expression is low
under basal conditions but its upregulation upon injury induces endothelial permeability as well as endothelial
inflammation via activation of G12/13-Rho-Rho kinase (ROCK)-Nuclear Factor-B (NFB) pathway. Therefore,
upregulation of S1PR2 switches endothelial S1P signaling from anti-inflammatory to pro-inflammatory. In
sepsis models, we have shown that endothelial S1PR2 plays a critical role in the induction of vascular
permeability in various organs (e.g. lung, kidney) leading to perpetuation of systemic inflammation. However, in
the cerebrovascular endothelium, the specific role of endothelial S1P signaling in BBB disruption upon
ischemia and the impact on stroke outcomes are not understood. We found that S1PR2 is transcriptionally
upregulated in cerebral microvessels in vivo after ischemia. In addition, global genetic or pharmacological
inhibition of S1PR2 prevents the early breakdown of the BBB resulting in decreased neuronal injury. Our in
vitro studies have revealed that S1PR2 regulates brain endothelial responses to ischemic injury (e.g.
permeability), but not neuronal or glial responses. These findings have provided the basis for our central
hypothesis that ischemia-induced transcriptional upregulation of S1PR2 in the endothelium exacerbates BBB
dysfunction and brain injury and it can be targeted as novel vasoprotective therapy in stroke. Aim 1 will
investigate the role of endothelial S1PR2 signaling in BBB dysfunction and its impact on brain injury, post-
ischemic neuroinflammation and stroke outcome. Aim 2 will elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the
expression of S1PR2 in cerebral microvessels upon ischemia. Aim 3 will evaluate the therapeutic potential of
targeting this pathway in stroke. Results of the proposed studies will define the novel role of endothelial S1P
signaling in BBB dysfunction in stroke and its impact on brain injury. They will also help clarify the molecular
mechanisms governing S1P signaling in the cerebrovascular endothelium upon ischemia. Overall, they are
expected to have a positive translational impact for novel therapeutic interventions specifically targeting the
endothelium in stroke."
10821400,"ABSTRACT: ANALYTICAL VALIDATION OF FRATAXIN PROTEOFORMS IN BLOOD AS BIOMARKERS
OF FRIEDREICH’S ATAXIA
Friedreich’s ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by an intronic GAA triplet expansion in the
FXN gene, leading to reduced expression of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. FA is estimated to affect 1 in
50,000 with a mean age of death in the fourth decade of life. There are no approved treatments for FA,
although experimental approaches, which involve up-regulation or replacement of frataxin protein, are being
tested. Frataxin is undetectable in serum or plasma, and whole blood could not be used because frataxin was
thought to be present in long-lived erythrocytes. An assay for analyzing frataxin in platelets, which have a half-
life of 10 days, which would allow therapeutic interventions to be tested, was developed by the Blair and Lynch
labs. The assay is based on stable isotope dilution immunopurification two-dimensional nano-ultra high
performance liquid chromatography/parallel reaction monitoring/high resolution mass spectrometry (nano-
UPLC-MS/HRMS) and is monitoring three tryptic peptides from frataxin. The assay had 100 % sensitivity and
specificity for discriminating between controls and FA cases but analyzing platelets on a routine basis is very
challenging in many clinical settings. We have now discovered that in erythrocyte is in fact a novel proteoform
of frataxin (isoform E) with 135-amino acids (76-210) and an N-terminally acetylated methionine residue. It
arises through an alternative splice-site form that is used for the canonical full-length form of frataxin (1-210).
There is three times as much isoform E in erythrocytes (26.7 ± 6.4 ng/mL) from the blood of healthy volunteers
(n=10) when compared with the mature mitochondrial frataxin present in other blood cells (7.1 ± 1.0 ng/mL).
We recently found that both isoform E (8.5 ± 1.1 ng/mL) and mature mitochondrial frataxin (2.1 ± 1.1 ng/mL)
are both reduced by > 70 % in blood from FA patients (n=29) when compared with healthy control subjects.
Isoform E lacks a mitochondrial targeting sequence and so it is distributed to both cytosol and the nucleus
when expressed in cultured cells. The ability to specifically quantify extra-mitochondrial and mitochondrial
isoforms of frataxin in whole blood would make it possible to follow the progress of the disease and monitor the
efficacy of therapeutic interventions. This will require the development of rigorously validated assays that
address the pre-analytical and analytical issues that are relevant to the use of blood as a biological matrix for
biomarker analysis rather than the more common use of serum or plasma. The present proposal addresses
these issues under following specific aims:
Aim 1: To conduct pre-analytical validation for collection and storage of mature frataxin and isoform E protein
in whole blood. Aim 2: To conduct analytical validation of the method for quantifying mature mitochondrial
frataxin and frataxin isoform E in whole blood. Aim 3: Validation of the mature frataxin and frataxin isoform E
proteoform analysis in whole blood from controls, FA carriers, and FA cases from multiple sites."

The cornea is an optically clear tissue that forms the front surface of the eye and accounts for nearly two thirds
of its refractive power. Corneal trauma/injury is a main cause for blindness worldwide. The current standard of
treatment, corneal transplantation, remains compromised by donor shortages and significant risks such as
infections and transplant rejection. The majority of corneal blindness is permanent due to scarring/fibrosis;
therefore, controlling the progression and state of scarring is crucial for the maintenance of vision. Surgical
techniques are improving; however, these procedures are very invasive and may have long-term complications.
Thus, there is a need for therapeutic interventions to reduce the need for corneal transplantation. Our group,
previously showed that a naturally occurring flavonoid, Quercetin, can regulate corneal fibrosis, extracellular
matrix assembly, and cellular metabolism. During our preliminary studies we investigated several commercial
Quercetin analogs and their ability to modulate corneal fibrotic and DNA repair markers. Subsequently, we
designed, synthesized, and tested seven novel synthetic flavonoids (sFNs) based on two different Quercetin
analogs. The goal of the proposed studies is to determine whether such novel sFNs can be discovered that
possess superior properties compared to naturally occurring flavonoids and are effective in mitigating or even
reversing corneal fibrosis. We propose one, targeted, and highly translational specific aim where we will employ
an iterative optimization process of design, synthesis, and evaluation to discover new sFNs that can be employed
to determine whether sFN treatment can significantly impact (reverse and/or prevent) corneal fibrosis. If
successful, the proposed studies will provide strong data, and justification, for future evaluation of our
compounds in live animal models with a goal to delineate the effects on corneal fibrosis. In addition, successful
completion of the proposed studies will justify and set the stage for continued drug discovery and development
efforts to advance sFNs as novel therapeutics for the ocular injuries/trauma."

to national standards. This program will reduce foodborne illness and injury by identifying potential
prevention practices, and will ultimately protect the public and industry by minimizing the time
between agency notification of a human food contamination event and the implementation of
effective control measures. RIDOH will continue to place an emphasis on building mutual reliance
with all programs.
The Manufactured Food Regulatory Program Standards (MFRPS) Coordinator will be responsible
for managing the grant under the direction of the Principal Investigator to maintain conformance
with the 2022 MFRPS. The MFRPS Coordinator will also manage the annual Task Force meeting
and outreach efforts to industry. All projects and work products will be shared with FDA and other
states to support the national integration effort. RI will remain actively involved in national
initiatives related to the enhancement of MFRPS and will provide continued assistance to newer
state programs that may benefit from RI’s experience.
In addition to internal auditing, RI will work with the FDA Office of Partnerships and FDA/ORA
Office of Operations Audit Staff to identify areas for improvement. During the three (3) year grant

10818924,"Project Summary
The major goal of this SBIR is to overcome critical barriers to wide-spread adoption and market expansion of
Silicone Wristbands (SWBs) as a tool for highly personalized environmental monitoring. SWBs represent a
recent research-based sampling approach in over 70 publications representing 1000s of participants and 100s
of detected chemicals but is not available to the consumer market. Using SWBs is appealing because they are
easy to wear, have a wide range of potential capture, and do not require training, energy, or maintenance.
However, there are several key problems that need to be addressed:
1. The cost of analysis is currently too high to expand to the consumer market. One way to reduce costs and
 lower prices is to focus chemical analyses on high impact compounds that are detected frequently and of
 high interest (toxicologically and topically).
2. The effect and magnitude of skin and air exposures when reporting chemical data from SWBs is not well
 understood. This makes SWB data communication challenging, and back-calculations to compare against
 published benchmarks (OSHA/EPA/etc.) or other published data difficult.
3. The complexity of wristband data poses novel challenges for reporting results back to researchers, let alone
 people with less exposure science experience in the consumer market. The range and complexity of
 chemical exposures that can be measured represent challenges that must be addressed to provide
 meaningful information for all potential users of the technology.
The proposed application describes using real-world SWB data to validate chemical lists of high interest
compounds as well as models developed in Phase I to help predict dominant routes of exposure. Additionally
for Phase II, we will gather real-world feedback to finalize chemical exposure reports suitable to a wide
audience. SWBs will be used in paired configurations (“traditional” and “air-only”) that will distinguish routes
of exposure and be analyzed for over 1500 chemical compounds including volatiles, pesticides, flame
retardants, phthalates, fragrances, and food-related chemicals.
There are four Aims to this proposal: 1) validate a focused chemical list from internal data and Phase I to
simplify a new and cheaper chemical analysis, 2) determine if dermal contact is a significant proportion of
chemical exposure through a field demonstration among 300 individuals , 3) optimize and validate predictive
exposure models, and 4) create a new chemical exposure report with the help of expert partners like ICF and
Silent Spring. With up to 600 samples screened for over 1500 organic chemicals and report feedback from 300
individuals, these datasets will address critical research goals and create new markets and opportunities."
10819079,"ABSTRACT. The development of a malaria vaccine is ""one of the most important research
projects in public health"" (CDC website). In 2021, there were 250 million malaria cases and
more than 600,000 deaths, with most deaths in children under 5. About 95% of malaria
deaths are in the sub-Sahara, home to some of the world’s poorest countries. Even with the
first malaria vaccine approved and more vaccines in the pipeline, there is a need for malaria
vaccines that are both clinically effective and affordable. Malaria vaccine antigens are
challenging to express in the needed quantities and at the needed price. Furthermore, as
malaria antigens are generally poorly immunogenic, they are often chemically conjugated to
a carrier protein to make nanoparticle vaccines. This SBIR proposal is directed to making
these antigens easier and less expensive to manufacture.
 Our collaborators at Oxford University and the NIH Laboratory of Malaria
Immunology and Vaccinology have identified domains of blood-stage and transmission-
blocking malaria proteins which elicit blocking antibodies, but they have only been made in
expensive eukaryotic systems but have not been successfully made in low-cost bacteria like
E. coli. We have developed the Gor∆ E. coli strain for producing difficult-to-express proteins.
Gor∆ has an oxidative cytoplasm and can make soluble, correctly folded disulfide bond
proteins in the cytoplasm at high yields. We have used this strain to make multi-gram/L of
soluble CRM197, a widely used vaccine carrier protein. By creating genetic fusions with
CRM197 as the partner, we could express proteins that otherwise could not be made in E.
coli. In this SBIR, we will: (1) Use Gor∆ to make CRM197 fusion proteins with (a) a domain of
blood-stage antigen, RH5, and (b) domains of transmission-blocking antigens, Pfs230 and
Pfs48/45; (2) Confirm proper folding using conformationally-dependent monoclonal
antibodies as well as perform biophysical analysis for correct MW, sequence, and disulfide
bonding, and (3) Synthesize chemical conjugates of the fusion proteins and compare their
immunogenicity to the unconjugated proteins. Antisera will be evaluated for blood-stage

10806032,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Significance: Prematurity a major health problem in the United States, with more than 385,000 babies born
preterm annually. The economic cost is more than $50 billion, mostly in extremely low birth weight infants
(ELBW, born<1000g). Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiovascular problem and
requires interventional closure in 16% of cases. Intervention is complicated by Post-Ligation Cardiac Syndrome
(PLCS), characterized by low or high blood pressure and respiratory instability, with highest incidence in the
most immature patients. Both PDA surgery and PLCS are independently associated with increased risk of
adverse respiratory outcomes and neuro-developmental disabilities. Of surviving ELBW infants after PDA
closure, 50% had neurodevelopmental impairment including severe handicaps. Postprocedural instability is
decreased by early milrinone use, a vasodilator drug which enhances heart function. Avoiding postprocedural
instability and establishing the safety of milrinone are considered important outcomes by parents.
Investigators and Prior Work: Prospective observational mechanistic data demonstrates that PLCS relates to
inability of the immature myocardium to tolerate the change in left ventricular loading conditions. Preliminary
data demonstrates the efficacy of milrinone in reducing the incidence of PLCS through optimizing heart
function. The Clinical Coordinating Center MPI Dr. Patrick McNamara, a world leading hemodynamics
scientist, conducted the original mechanistic studies which characterized the biological mechanisms of PLCS
and the pharmacology of milrinone. Dr Edward Bell (MPI) has an extensive record in leading multicenter
clinical trials and the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) PI Dr. Abhik Das has led several NHLBI funded trials.
Innovation: In most centers PLCS is recognized late, when hypotension is severe, and prompts use of
vasopressor drugs which impair heart function. There are no prior randomized clinical trials of milrinone after
PDA closure; therefore, neither treatment efficacy nor long-term safety is known. We propose a randomized
controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the immediate benefits of milrinone in decreasing the rate of PLCS and 7-day
mortality. The need to assess long-term outcomes of RCTs is compelling to ensure treatment safety.
Approach: We will perform a RCT in preterm infants born less than 28 weeks’ gestation asking: “Does routine
use of intravenous milrinone lower the risk of PLCS or mortality within 7 days of intervention and is treatment
safe?” The question is relevant to the mission of NHLBI and aligns with parental values to minimize
postprocedural risk. In addition, it represents a paradigm shift in Neonatology to conduct clinical trials of
treatments that offer biologic plausibility in illnesses that have been mechanistically characterized.
Environment: We have partnered with the NICHD Neonatal Research Network (NRN), which includes 15
clinical centers, and have added 4 additional sites to maximize enrollment capabilities. We believe this trial is
both feasible and achievable based on the prior track record of NRN in completing meaningful clinical trials."
10932411,"Proposal Summary
There are no validated systems for identifying children without serious bacterial infection (SBI) upon admission
to a pediatric ICU (PICU). Given the high prevalence of SBI among critically ill children (up to 46%) and risks
associated with delayed antibiotic administration, nearly 50% of children without SBI receive antibiotics while
microbiologic studies are pending. However, antibiotics can have adverse effects including acute kidney injury,
clostridium difficile colitis, and development of antibiotic resistance. The long-term goal of this research is to
validate and disseminate machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision support (CDS) tools able to improve
PICU antibiotic decision-making thereby reducing antibiotic associated harm among critically ill children. In
prior work, Dr. Martin developed ML-based predictive models, which use electronic health record (EHR) inputs
(vital sign, laboratory, and other clinical data), to accurately identify children without SBI upon PICU admission
in a single center retrospective cohort. The central hypothesis is that these models will demonstrate similar
robust performance during prospective and multicenter evaluations, and that an antibiotic decisional needs
analysis of PICU clinicians will inform the optimal design of model-based CDS tools. The central hypothesis will
be tested via three aims: 1) prospectively evaluate two SBI predictive models within a single center EHR and
determine the potential effect on antibiotic-days per child; 2) evaluate ML model generalizability by testing
them in a multicenter EHR cohort; and 3) perform a multicenter, multidisciplinary antibiotic decisional needs
analysis of PICU clinicians to facilitate user-centered design of equitable model-based CDS tools. In Aim 1, two
SBI predictive models will be prospectively evaluated in silent fashion (predictions not revealed to clinicians) at
a single center over two years. Model predictions will be compared to patient SBI outcomes to determine their
negative predictive value and potential to reduce unnecessary antibiotics. In Aim 2, the same models will be
applied to a retrospective dataset of six US children's hospital PICUs (~178,000 encounters over 8+ years) to
assess generalizability by determining each model's negative predictive value and potential to reduce
unnecessary antibiotics. In Aim 3, a rigorous qualitative content analysis of PICU clinician interviews from five
institutions will identify the values driving antibiotic decision-making and enable user-centered design of model-
based CDS tools. The research is innovative because it involves development of the first clinically validated
system for excluding SBI at PICU admission and uses a ML approach to do so. The research is significant as it
accelerates development of generalizable antibiotic decision-making tools to assist PICU clinicians in safely
minimizing unnecessary antibiotics and associated harm. The educational component of this application will
allow Dr. Martin to attain expertise in biostatistics, probability, ML bias, and study design, as well as technical
skills in programming, ML, and CDS. This will allow him to transition to independence and make him uniquely
qualified to develop, validate, and implement CDS tools able to improve the outcomes of critically ill children."

This project aims to address inherent financial disincentives for active surveillance for prostate cancer. Many
men with favorable-risk disease will not benefit from aggressive intervention. The uncertainty surrounding who
and how to treat has led to wide variation in treatment patterns, in part driven by nonclinical factors such as
financial incentives. The strategy of surveillance, which avoids or delays aggressive treatment for men with
favorable-risk tumors, has been shown to reduce treatment associated morbidity and spending, without
compromising survival. As such, it is well aligned with the current national interest in improving the value of
health care delivery. Yet studies demonstrate surveillance is underutilized and its implementation varies widely.
There are several factors contributing to this, but one plausible contribution is the financial incentives for
providers embedded within the delivery system that favor aggressive interventions, as their reimbursement is
immediate and can be several-fold greater than for surveillance-related activities. Recent payment reforms
encourage a movement to alternative payment models (APMs), intended to improve the value of health care.
An APM in this context could provide additional payment to providers for performing surveillance, while tying
reimbursement to achievement of quality targets that ensure its appropriate performance and lowering total
payer costs. The objective of this proposal is to develop APMs to promote rational use of surveillance, with the
following aims: 1) To understand urologist response to payment incentives for active surveillance; 2) To
develop robust quality performance measures for implementation of active surveillance; and, 3) To develop
and simulate the financial impact of alternative payment models for favorable-risk prostate cancer on payers
and providers. Ultimately, APMs will align financial incentives for payers and providers, reduce unwarranted
variation in implementation, and shift more men to appropriate use of surveillance thereby improving
population health among men with favorable-risk prostate cancer."
10805930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide[1]. AD is histopathologically defined by plaque-
forming amyloid beta-protein (Aβ) and neurofibrillary tangles of phosphorylated tau protein. Amyloid and tau pathology
typically begins in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex before spreading to anterior and lateral temporal structures of the
brain, implicating them in hippocampal-dependent memory impairments. However, specific roles for either amyloid or
tau in memory loss remain elusive. An important memory impaired in AD is social recognition memory, required to
recognize familiar individuals. Social recognition memory engages a population of neurons in CA2 that are surrounded by
specialized extracellular matrix structures called perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are believed to stabilize synapses. PNNs
typically surround GABAergic inhibitory neurons, yet in the hippocampal CA2 region, PNNs encapsulate excitatory
pyramidal neurons the very neurons implicated in social memory. PNNs are substrate for proteolytic enzymes such as
MMPs know to be released with brain inflammation as occurs in AD. PNN disruption has indeed been reported in AD
mouse models and postmortem AD human brains and we found PNNs in CA2 to be specifically degraded in human AD
autopsies and mouse models of AD. We therefor hypothesize that amyloid and/or tau pathology triggers proteolysis of
PNNs in hippocampus, destabilizing synapses in CA2 explaining impairments in social recognition memory. Using three
established mouse models of AD that replicate either amyloid, tau or both pathologies we will (1) define a timeline for
onset of PNN disruption, emergence of social memory deficits, and importance of underlying pathology, (2) examine
whether PNNs play a causal role in social memory deficits in normal aging and in AD and (3) explore cellular mechanisms
whereby PNNs contribute to this selective memory phenotype."

The ultimate objective of this K01 proposal is to enable Dr. Ida Fonkoue to become an independent research
investigator by 1) developing expertise in vascular, hormonal and sleep measures in humans; 2) acquiring
scientific growth through a rigorous training plan, within an outstanding scientific environment that has a long
tradition in translational vascular research; and 3) generating sufficient preliminary results to support an NIH
R01 application. The candidate’s long-term goal is to build an NIH-funded research program in clinical and
translational research in women’s health, studying derangements of vascular, neural and hormonal control,
that contribute to the high rates of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women living with chronic
stress exposure such as those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder or
panic disorder.
 Over 7 million U.S. adults have PTSD, a disorder associated with a greater risk for hypertension and
CVD. While healthy premenopausal women are relatively protected from CVD compared to men, a diagnosis
of PTSD increases CVD risk in women by up to 3-fold. Understanding the mechanisms underlying CVD risk in
women with PTSD is of paramount importance to develop intervention strategies aiming at protecting the future
health of this vulnerable population. Based on our preliminary data, the working hypothesis of this project is
that: PTSD inhibits nitric oxide bioavailability, resulting in decreased endothelial function, increased arterial
stiffness and increased sympathetic activation; and that these changes are exacerbated by low estradiol levels
and sleep disturbances. Aim 1 will identify alterations in SNS activity in premenopausal women with PTSD and
determine if these alterations are a function of low E2 levels and sleep disturbances. Aim 2 will Identify
alterations in vascular function in premenopausal women with PTSD and determine if these alterations are a
function of low E2 levels and sleep disturbances.
 Emory University, where the PI’s entire mentoring team is located, boasts an intellectually rich research
environment whose resources will be used to carry out the proposed research, including an NIH-funded
Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance (GA CTSA). During this K01 award, the PI will devote 75%
effort to this project and career development-related activities as highlighted in her four years training and
research plans. She will complete a Master of Science in Clinical Research offered by the GA CTSA and
prepare future career development grant submission. This research project, combined with multidisciplinary
mentorship, didactic education, and practical experience, will provide Dr. Fonkoue with the training and skills to
become a successful independent investigator."
10807074,"Project Summary/Abstract: Identifying Disease-Specific Immune Cell Shifts in Chronic Fibrotic Interstitial
Lung Diseases with Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
Description: Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a heterogeneous group of lung disorders that cause scarring
of the lung parenchyma and affect an estimated 300,000 people in the United States alone. These diseases
can be categorized as having “intrinsic,” “extrinsic,” or “auto-immune” etiologies. A particular subset of chronic
fibrotic ILDs – idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (intrinsic), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic), and
connective tissue-associated ILD (auto-immune) – can present with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) patterns
on imaging and have similar symptoms and pulmonary function tests. However, their prognoses and
treatments are distinct. Among them, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is associated with the highest mortality in
patients and confers a median survival time after diagnosis of three to five years. Moreover, incorrect diagnosis
and administration of immunosuppressive treatments to patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can
significantly worsen their disease. Therefore, it is critical to accurately diagnose these patients in a minimally
invasive manner, such as through peripheral blood draws. Obtaining peripheral blood mononuclear cells poses
little risk to patients and provides a window into their health; previous work by the application’s sponsor, Dr.
Naftali Kaminski, and his group demonstrated that PBMC cell-type composition and gene expression
signatures can distinguish idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis disease severity. Leveraging single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, we hope to elucidate the disease-specific immune mechanisms of ILDs
with UIP patterns (UIP ILDs) captured in the peripheral blood. In particular, Aim 1 will determine whether
disease-specific immune aberrations can be captured by peripheral blood cell-type composition and gene
expression signatures in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and connective
tissue disease-associated ILD. Aim 2 will ascertain whether there are distinct antigens that drive disease in
UIP ILD patients and will characterize the adaptive immune landscape in these diseases through B and T cell
receptor profiling. The goals of this study are three-fold: 1) to characterize disease-specific peripheral blood
biomarkers, 2) to create a clinical decision model that would diagnose a UIP ILD subtype given gene
expression, cell composition, T and B cell receptor repertoires, and patient clinical information, and 3) to gain
insight into UIP ILD disease mechanisms to advance patient therapeutics. In summary, the proposed research
will hopefully inform clinical diagnostics and treatments for patients with similarly presenting UIP ILDs. The
fellowship also includes a training plan with valuable learning experiences for the applicant’s development as a
physician-scientist."
10807078,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury (SCI) progression can be divided into acute and chronic phases. Following the primary injury,
bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMɸ) infiltrate to the injured epicenter where they engulf myelin debris
to become proinflammatory myelin-laden macrophages (Mye-Mϕ). Mye-Mɸ accumulate in the injured core
densely and occupy almost entire epicenter of injured area indefinitely, which would consequently result in: 1)
They prevent the entry and growth of axons, which inhibits remyelination. 2) They lose their normal phagocytic
capacity for dead cells and cellular debris, which may exacerbate the inflammatory microenvironment. 3) They
release inflammatory mediators, which trigger an inflammatory cascade that prevents tissue regeneration. Our
data indicated that the migratory potential of BMDMɸ is directly suppressed when they engulf myelin debris. We
resently reported that newly formed microvessels and their lining endothelial cells (ECs) in the injured cord are
able to engulf myelin debris. Myelin debris engulfment by ECs (Mye-ECs) significantly increased deposition of
extracellular matrices (ECM) such as collagen and fibronectin which may serve as extrinsic factor to promote
the adhesive interaction between Mye-Mϕ-ECs and lead to Mye-Mϕ retention in the injured lesion. Our central
hypothesis is that Mye-Mϕ retention in the injured core is mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms which
promote Mye-Mɸ retention through ECM adhesion. The objective of the proposed project is to investigate the
underlying mechanisms of Mye-Mϕ sequestration and identify treatment strategies that target Mye-Mɸ in the
injury site, which may restore normal Mφ functions and lead to improvements in lesion resolution. The rationale
for the proposed research is based on preliminary investigations that demonstrate Mye-Mɸ become ‘trapped’ via
a mix of intrinsic (Mɸ produced) and extrinsic (environmental) mechanisms within the lesion. Our central
hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) To study whether myelin debris, either directly or via
autocrine pathways, inhibits BMDMϕ migration ability which promotes their lesion retention; 2) To determine
whether adhesive ECM produced by Mye-ECs in the injured core aggravates Mye-Mɸ retention; and 3) To
investigate whether targeting Mye-Mφ and subsequently switching their phenotype toward a reparative
phenotype promotes tissue healing. This research is innovative because we propose that inflammatory Mye-
Mɸ trapped within the injured spinal cord lesion contribute to the chronic SCI lesion, preventing full resolution of
the injury. This work is significant because Aims 1 and 2 will identify the underlying mechanisms governing
Mye-Mφ retention, while Aim 3 will demonstrate novel strategies for the resolution of chronic SCI inflammation
and lesions. This will have the positive impact of identifying novel therapeutic strategies for therapeutic
interventions not only to treat SCI but also to other demyelinating disorders that generate myelin debris."
10806343,"I have been associated with VA since 2005 and have been a VA Merit award funded investigator since 2012. I
study lipid metabolism and signaling in cardiovascular and metabolic disease with a focus on functional
validation of the PLPP3 lipid phosphatase gene which we cloned in the late 1990s as a determinant of
heritable cardiovascular disease risk. Our research has identified a lipid signaling pathway that promotes
vascular inflammation and associated pathologies including atherosclerosis and calcific aortic valve disease,
both of which have a higher incidence in Veterans than the general population. Our findings suggest new
approaches for diagnosis and therapeutic management of these conditions. I have authored 287 peer
reviewed research reports with a total of ~25,000 citations (~70 papers are cited more than 100 times, 6 have
more than 500 citations) and this includes (in most cases as a VA affiliated investigator) publications in highly
selective journals. I have a strong record of professional service, local and national service to VA and of
collaboration with other VA investigators (61 publications with 6 different researchers). My laboratory has been
a productive training environment for pre- and post-doctoral fellows who have been recognized by highly
competitive awards including NIH F and K series grants and some of these individuals are now successful
independent established academic investigators. To support our lipid research, and with VA support for two
Shared Equipment Evaluation Program grants, I developed expertise in biomedical mass spectrometry which
is now a major focus of my program. Through my role as core facility director and my association with the
NIEHS supported Superfund and Environmental Diseases Core Centers at the University of Kentucky I
became actively involved in development and application of analytical methods to study human health effects
of exposure to environmental chemicals. This is the area of my VA research that I highlight in this application.
Exposures to chemicals in the environment are an acknowledged determinant of health risk and a particular
concern for veterans and active-duty military personnel as recently acknowledged by the Honoring our Promise
to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT-Act). Our analytical laboratory at CAVHS supports VA
and DOD funded efforts to understand health effects of exposure to per and polyfluorinated alkyl substances
(PFAS) which are manmade surfactant chemicals with widespread use for military firefighting. Exposure to
high levels of PFAS is associated with increased risks of several cancers, dyslipidemia, endocrine and immune
dysfunction in exposed individuals. Our primary project examines PFAS exposure in military firefighters and
construction workers enrolled in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and its progenitor the Millennium Cohort.
Building on this work we are developing a facile, inexpensive, minimally invasive approach to monitor Service
Member exposure to different classes of environmental chemicals using finger stick blood collection, dried
blood spots, and large-scale targeted and untargeted analytical methods. This will eventually enable routine
biomonitoring and screening of veterans and service members to support creation of a longitudinal exposure
data repository. This would become a central component of larger scale assessment of environmental
chemical exposures in military populations to inform strategies to mitigate risk in exposed individuals. These
are necessarily team-based efforts where we our role is to provide accurate measurements of circulating
environmental chemicals that are then used by statisticians and epidemiologists using multivariate models to
identify associations between environmental chemical exposures and risk of non-communicable diseases. My
efforts at CAVHS are well aligned with the intent of VA to establish a managed research portfolio in the broad
area of Environmental Exposure (Military Exposure Research Program) and with VA/DOD involvement in the
Cancer Moonshot Initiative notably the Project for Military Exposures and Toxin History Evaluation in US
Service Members (PROMETHEUS). The Career Scientist Award would support my effort on these projects."
10806351,"Inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) develops in both sepsis (systemic infection) as well as
sterile lung injury. The neuro-inflammation mirrors the peripheral inflammation and affects the neural control of
respiration. We have published that neuro-inflammation in the nuclei tractus solitarii (nTS, dorsomedial medulla)
decreases synaptic efficacy of vagal sensory feedback and increases the predictability of ventilatory pattern
variability (VPV). Further, healthy rats increase their respiratory rate (fR) and ventilatory pattern predictability
following IL-1β microinjections in the nTS. Thus, while we have an understanding that peripheral inflammation is
reflected in the nTS and affects breathing at molecular and functional levels, the effects at the level of the
complete respiratory network remain obscure. Our hypothesis is that brainstem neuro-inflammation alters
respiratory network function including diminishing regulatory sensory feedback that ultimately
decreases VPV. The increases in fR and predictability of the ventilatory pattern persist in in situ brainstem
preparations that are derived from rats with lung injury or with peritonitis. This indicates alterations in respiratory
network function are mediated via alterations in the central control of breathing. Thus, published and preliminary
data indicate that neuro-inflammation of the brainstem drives changes in ventilation.
 We test our hypothesis in the following Specific Aims: 1) to correlate neuro-inflammation, respiratory network
function (assessed by VPV) and create an anatomic and functional atlas of the ponto-medullary respiratory
circuits in sham and lipopolysaccharide-treated rats, 2) to determine if etiology of the inflammatory process
affects patterns of neuro-inflammation and disruptions of respiratory network function, and 3) to determine if
therapies that reduce neuro-inflammation attenuate increases in fR and predictability of VPV, and consequently
restore network function.
 We will apply recent advances in multi-electrode array technology and analysis to record respiratory-
modulated ensemble single-unit activities across nuclei of the ponto-medullary respiratory network. In Aim 1, we
will answer where and how neuro-inflammation disrupts central- and sensory-modulated respiratory network
activity and connectivity associated with changes in VPV. Electrophysiologic and anatomic datasets will be co-
registered to the Waxholm MRI atlas of the rat brain to enable analysis of their relationships. In Aim 2, we will
determine if the etiology of inflammation is reflected in neuro-inflammation and respiratory dysfunction. In Aim 3,
we will determine if targeting neuro-inflammation in peritonitis restores respiratory network function and VPV. In
summary, we will use this innovative approach to investigate the impact of neuro-inflammation on the function
of an intact neural network. These studies will support the clinical translation of VPV as an early biometric of
disease progression and identify neuro-inflammation as a novel therapeutic target.

10806372,"The apolipoprotein E (APOE) E4 allele is one of the main genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
an important contributor to cerebrovascular (CV) dysfunction, which is a major component of AD pathogenesis.
Recent advances in AD research suggest that E4 carriers have an age-dependent vulnerability in supplying
glucose to the brain, which corresponds with lower glucose metabolism and precedes brain amyloid and tau
pathologies. The CV system regulates nutrient transport to the brain to support neuronal bioenergetics, but
aging individuals with the E4 allele experience deficits in this process. This eventually forces neurons to
perform fatty acid (FA) metabolism, which is harmful if performed in neurons given that it can contribute to
oxidative stress. The process of FA metabolism requires L-carnitine for transporting FA as acylcarnitines
(CAR) into mitochondria (L-carnitine bioenergetics). The importance of this system in AD is highlighted by our
recent study showing that L-carnitine bioenergetic deficits are present among E4 carriers and correlate with CV
pathologies seen with AD. Our animal studies show that pathways that link glucose sensing with L-carnitine-
bioenergetics are dysregulated in the cerebrovasculature and the brain parenchyma of humanized APOE4
mouse models. This corresponds with a loss of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) that facilitates glymphatic clearance of
Abeta from the brain. Therefore, we hypothesize that E4 disrupts L-carnitine bioenergetics within the brain
endothelial cells (BEC) and the mural cells, thereby reducing glucose availability in neurons and astrocytes.
This would also hamper the ability of astrocytes to perform glycolysis and L-carnitine bioenergetics, which
consequently increases the reliance on L-carnitine bioenergetics within neurons and contributes to oxidative
stress, inflammation and poor Abeta clearance from the brain. Hence, abnormal L-carnitine bioenergetics
caused by E4 in the neurovascular unit cells (BEC, mural cells, and astroglia) increase the brain’s vulnerability
to developing AD. To test this hypothesis, we will first determine whether BEC or mural cells experience
altered L-carnitine bioenergetics and determine the differential impact of APOE genotypes throughout aging in
mouse and human BEC and mural cells. We will then determine if increasing L-carnitine bioenergetics helps
restore nutrient balance in the neurons and astrocytes by utilizing selective knockout (KO) of acetyl-CoA
carboxylase (ACC1) in the BEC of APOE and AD mouse models. We will also evaluate if selective KO of
ACC1 in BEC of APOE and AD mouse models improves astroglial and neuronal bioenergetics and glymphatic
function to facilitate Abeta clearance from the brain parenchyma. The proposed studies will provide novel
insights into identifying molecular mechanisms within the L-carnitine bioenergetics pathways in order to
develop therapeutic options that specifically target the E4 carriers who experience a significantly higher
cerebrovascular disease burden which is associated with AD pathogenesis."
10806864,"Acute cardiorenal syndrome (cardiorenal syndrome type 1, CRS1) frequently follows the most common cause
of admission to a Veterans Health Administration inpatient facility, acute cardiovascular disease. Although
CRS1 seems to self-resolve in most cases, development of chronic kidney disease often occurs rapidly
afterward (within 1-2 years). Animal studies demonstrate there is mechanistic connection between CRS1 and
early onset CKD, a form of AKI-CKD transition. The long term goal is to determine mechanisms of long-term
outcomes of CRS1 with a focus on the potential for translational intervention. The proposed work is focused
on whether and how CRS1 induces further cardiovascular disease commonly comorbid with CKD. Published
data generated in a mouse model of CRS1, cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CA/CPR)
demonstrate that despite recovery of renal function 2 weeks after CA/CPR, CKD ubiquitously occurs by 7
weeks after CA/CPR. Data generated for this proposal show that 7 weeks after CA/CPR, mice have
developed systemic hypertension with associated changes in renal vascular architecture and myocardial wall
thickness. Tantalizingly, CKD and systemic hypertension are recapitulated by injection of a soluble cardiac-
derived factor, CSRP3, which is released into the plasma after CA/CPR. CSRP3 functions as transcriptional
activator of the myogenesis pathway in cardiac development. Data suggest that CSRP3 mediates the renin-
angiotensin system through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the renal proximal tubule. Therefore
the central hypothesis in this proposal is acute cardiorenal syndrome causes chronic systemic hypertension via
CSRP3-induced, myogenesis-mediated reduction of proximal tubule ACE2 activity. The specific hypothesis is
that that the myogenesis factor MyoD is induced in proximal tubule epithelial cells by CSRP3 exposure, and in
turn represses ACE2 membrane distribution. This hypothesis will be investigated in two specific aims. Aim 1
will determine the mechanism by which CRS1 causes chronic systemic hypertension in vivo. Wild-type mice,
and mice with inducible, cardiac-specific deletion of CSRP3, or deletion of proximal tubule ACE2 will be
subjected to CA/CPR. It is hypothesized that in the absence of cardiac CSRP3, hypertension will be blunted,
while in the absence of ACE2 in the proximal tubule, hypertension will be exacerbated. Blood pressure will be
assessed in awake, unrestrained mice 7 weeks after CA/CPR using radiotelemetry, and renal function,
myogenesis determination genes, and components of the renin-angiotensin system including ACE2 will be
assessed using qPCR, immunoblotting, and renal immunofluorescence. Heart and kidney sections will be
assessed to determine whether myocardial wall thickness and renal arcuate arterial wall thickness are altered.
Translational experiments will determine plasma CSRP3 levels in deidentified patients with cardiac disease,
and test whether pharmacologic inhibition of CSRP3 uptake in the kidney ameliorates development of
hypertension in mice. Aim 2 will delineate the mechanism of proximal tubule epithelial cell functional change in
vitro, and will be performed in primary culture of human proximal tubule epithelial cells. To test the hypothesis
that CSRP3 induces proximal tubule epithelial cell functional change including reduction of ACE2 polarity via
regulation of myogenesis determination genes, cells will be exposed to recombinant CSRP3, vehicle, and
relevant protein controls. To model the inflammatory environment in the AKI-CKD kidney, transforming growth
factor beta will be used to costimulate cells in addition to CSRP3 alone. qPCR, immunofluorescence, and
immunoblotting will be used to assess ACE2, myogenesis determination gene transcripts, expression, and
distribution. Effects on ACE2 polarity and function will be evaluated. shRNA interference will be used to knock
down expression of critical pathway mediators including myogenic differentiation antigen (MyoD). The studies
proposed here test mechanisms of interaction between the injured heart and kidney, and will delineate an
important pathway by which CRS1 leads to chronic cardiorenal disease."

 Alzheimer's disease is one of the most common and progressive genetic neurodegenerative disorders in
the US with more than 5 million people currently living with Alzheimer's disease with risk factors often associated
with age and sex. Women are more likely to develop a rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, than men when
predictive factors such as obesity, lifespan, and enhanced stroke severity are considered. Protein arginine
methyltransferases are a prevalent posttranslational modification that can occur in both the nucleus and
cytoplasm and are thought to be involved in many disease processes. This emerging and difficult area of inquiry
has limited investigations into the neurovascular system, brain emergent networks, with only indirect applications
related to neurological diseases, where the functional role of protein arginine methyltransferases as they relate
to brain metabolism, circulation, functional learning and memory are understudied.
 We seek to investigate protein arginine methyltransferase 4 as an important age and sex(female)-related
brain regulatory element to delay neuronal senescence. We propose that protein arginine methyltransferase 4
is enhanced in aged 3xTg-AD female mice v. their young and male counterparts. This leads to the disruption of
neurovascular coupling, blood brain barrier integrity, and functional learning and memory. Our central hypothesis
is inhibition of protein arginine methyltransferase 4 can enhance neurovascular coupling, maintain blood-brain-
barrier integrity, and attenuate learning/memory deficits in aged 3xTg-AD female mice. We describe protein
arginine methyltransferase 4 modulation as a therapeutic potential against Alzheimer's disease and other
vascular cognitive impairment disorders."

The USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center first participated in the research activities of
SWOG in 1987 and was initially funded in 1992. This five-year grant cycle has had increased
administrative and academic participation, with maintenance of high clinical and correlative trial
entry, commensurate with available SWOG funding and added resources from USC. The major
emphases of the USC team are (a) to provide leadership across the NTCN to design and
efficiently perform clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of novel regimens or
modifications of existing regimens; (b) to provide leadership in biomarker development and in
integration of new technologies into NCTN trials, taking advantage of a systematic approach to
collection, processing, and storage of blood, normal tissue, fresh or frozen tumor tissue, and other
relevant biologic samples for molecular and pharmacologic studies; and (c) to evaluate cancer
treatment regimens in special patient populations, such as rare cancers, the elderly and ethnic
minorities. USC investigators have not only contributed extensively to SWOG trials but have
demonstrated administrative/academic leadership, facilitating the translation of specific themes
of investigation to SWOG. Recent NCTN trials such as SWOG/ALLIANCE 80405 and S1401
characterizing metastatic colorectal and prostate cancer has significant increased the
understanding of molecular subtyping and characterization of both cancers integrating cutting
edge technologies including NGS testing and single cell molecular classification. USC UG1
members are playing an active role in NCI task forces and steering committees. As part of its
dedication to cancer clinical research, USC has been successful in mentoring young investigators
through the UM1 Career Development Awards, Project Team Memberships and SWOG Young
Investigator Awards. USC has expanded its institutional training and mentoring capabilities.
Lastly, as a Network Lead Academic Participating Site, USC will continue to bring unique
strengths to the NCI National Clinical Trials Network thanks to its strength in recruitment of
minorities to clinical trials, accrual to rare cancers such as biliary and bladder cancers, and a well-
developed clinical research infrastructure."
10795932,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human cancers develop through the successive acquisition of somatic mutations which give rise to clonal cell
populations that outgrow normal cells through a reiterative process of clonal selection and evolution. While the
multi-step nature of oncogenesis has been long recognized, the fundamental principles that underlie this
process and determine its outcomes remain incompletely understood. It is now clear from large-scale
sequencing of cancer genomes that mutational co-occurrence and the relative timing of mutational acquisition
follow non-random patterns, but limited studies have addressed the impact of mutational order and cooperation
in biological or clinical outcomes.
Leukemogenesis offers an attractive case to model and study overarching principles of the clonal evolution.
Leukemias have very simple genomes, carrying very low numbers of driver genetic lesions compared to solid
tumors. More specifically, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) genomes can harbor as few as 2-3 driver genetic
lesions. My lab recently developed a model of clonal evolution of AML using sequential CRISPR-mediated
gene editing of human iPSCs. We found that by introducing 3 driver mutations into normal iPSCs (ASXL1 C-
terminus truncation, SRSF2P95L and NRASG12D SAR) we can create a “de novo” engraftable AML. Furthermore, our
preliminary data suggest that cooperation between specific mutations and/or the order of their acquisition
impose constraints on leukemogenesis.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of the order of mutational acquisition in the
clonal evolution of AML. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that the initiating mutation establishes an
epigenetic landscape upon which the later mutation(s) need to act to establish a leukemic state in our iPSC
model and in primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Aim 2 will define the minimum
number of mutations required for leukemogenesis. In Aim 3 we will explore the mechanistic constraints
underlying “obligatory late” signaling activating mutations by varying the order of acquisition of ASXL1, SRSF2
and NRAS mutations in our de novo oncogenesis model.
This work harnesses a unique myeloid leukemogenesis model developed in my laboratory to address
fundamental questions on the effects of mutational order on leukemogenesis and oncogenesis in general."

Translating basic vision research to the clinic progresses at an astounding rate, but we still have a long way to
go in developing treatments and potential cures for blinding vision diseases. The advancements in methods,
e.g., viral vectors, genetic approaches, single cell transcriptomics, imaging modalities, optogenetics, and stem
cell-based approaches, have changed our ability to understand the visual system in health and disease. The
major aim of the University of Minnesota’s program in the Training in Translational Vision Sciences is to prepare
predoctoral trainees for careers as independent scientists with excellent knowledge of basic science, and
importantly, provide connections to clinical problems and real patients with vision-threatening disorders. The 18
training faculty are a well-funded, productive group of vision scientists with a commitment to training the next
generation of vision scientists. Ten of these 18 have funding from the National Eye Institute, but all preceptors
have well-funded laboratories and strong publication records. The major areas of research focus include real-
time imaging, visual processing in human and animal models, vascular biology, and development. These focus
areas are typically coupled with a strong translational objective focused on developing new strategies to improve
vision in individuals with significant visual impairment. We are requesting funding to support five predoctoral
candidates who have entered into the laboratories of one of the vision scientist preceptors. Predoctoral trainees
will come from one of four graduate programs: “Neuroscience”, “Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology &
Genetics”, or “Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics” in the medical school, or the Graduate Program
in Psychology in the College of Liberal Arts. With the focus on translational vision science, we have greatly
increased the collaborations between basic scientists and the clinical faculty in the Department of Ophthalmology
and Visual Neurosciences (DOVN). Several new key elements of the Translational Vision Research Training
program include a newly designed course for trainees, Critical and Translational Reasoning in Visual Science,
co-taught by the training faculty and the clinical faculty in the DOVN. All trainees must attend and present their
research at our annual Spring Symposium, where nationally known and in-house experts in vision science
present their most recent research along with our trainees and faculty as well as participate in one of several
vision-related journal clubs. The Program Directors and Executive Committee select and evaluate trainees for
this program. The program directors are Linda McLoon PhD and Harald Junge PhD, both in the DOVN. We have
built in a Program Director transition plan, with Drs. McLoon and Junge sharing the position during the first two
years of the program, and with Dr. Junge taking over as Principal Investigator in years three to five. As we move
toward increasingly collaborative research between our basic and clinically trained faculty members, the training
we provide will maximize our ability to prepare vision scientists with a multi-disciplinary education needed to
meet the “audacious goals” of the NEI - focused on preventing, treating, and rehabilitating blinding eye disease."
10795858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Histoplasma capsulatum is a fungal pathogen that infects both immunocompromised and immunocompetent
individuals. The innate immune system alone is ineffective in controlling Histoplasma yeasts because
Histoplasma invades and thrives within host phagocytic cells. Histoplasma’s parasitism of macrophages
requires acquisition and metabolism of suitable nutritional resources from the host cell, yet the host molecules
that serve as nutrients for are largely unknown. Preliminary investigations have shown intracellular yeasts are
gluconeogenic and likely consume amino acids, particularly compounds that are related to glutamate. These
findings provide a critical foothold for identifying the host molecules consumed by Histoplasma yeasts.
This proposal takes a multidisciplinary approach, integrating evidence from molecular biology, genetics, and
metabolomics to determine the host molecules available to Histoplasma yeasts within the phagosome and how
they are metabolized to meet the carbon and energy needs within host cells. The intracellular growth
requirement for glutamate dehydrogenase activity narrows the potential host molecules for metabolic carbon to
glutamate-related amino acids or glutamate-generating host molecules. Transcriptional and metabolite
profiling will be combined with functional tests to define the metabolic pathways necessary for Histoplasma
proliferation within host macrophages. Isotopic labeling of host metabolites will be used to follow their import
and subsequent incorporation into Histoplasma metabolism intermediates over time to demonstrate the flux of
carbon from macrophage to intracellular yeasts and identify host substrate entry points into yeast central
carbon metabolism. These findings will be genetically tested by characterization of Histoplasma’s amino acid
and peptide transporters and RNAi-based interference with candidate host metabolite import into intracellular
Histoplasma yeast cells. Together these data will provide multiple lines of evidence to define how Histoplasma
yeasts exploit the phagosome as a replication-permissive intracellular niche during host infection.
This proposal is submitted in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) PA-19-083 “Novel
approaches to understand, prevent, treat, and diagnose coccidioidomycosis (Valley Fever) and other select
endemic fungal infections.” The proposal answers the announcement’s goal to address the pathogenesis of
endemic fungi with the ultimate goal of advancing the field towards solutions for treatment of endemic
mycoses. Of the dimorphic endemic fungal pathogens, Histoplasma is the best molecularly characterized
fungus and it has the most advanced molecular genetics to facilitate functional testing for mechanistic studies.
The results of our studies will reveal new disease treatment avenues by highlighting transport and metabolic
reactions essential for the narrow metabolism imposed on Histoplasma by its residence within macrophage
phagosomes. Our genetic tests have shown that impairment of these critical metabolic reactions reduces
Histoplasma proliferation in the mammalian lung, demonstrating the therapeutic potential."

 Immunotherapies designed to stimulate anti-tumor immune responses by enhancing CD8+ T-cell activity
have revolutionized the treatment of cancer, but many patients do not respond. Robust CD8+ T-cell recognition
of tumors requires the presentation of cellular antigens on Major Histocompatibility Complex I (MHC-I) and
many cancers suppress MHC-I presentation as a means of evading immune detection and acquiring
resistance to immunotherapy. This proposal outlines experiments to explore a mechanistically distinct method
of stimulating antigen presentation by disrupting protein-folding pathways. The heat shock protein 90 kDa
(HSP90) is a molecular chaperone that is known to regulate the stability of numerous cellular proteins, termed
HSP90 “clients”, including proteins involved in oncogenic signaling pathways. Perhaps most interestingly,
HSP90 is particularly important for maintaining the conformational stability of mutated proteins. Therefore,
inhibition of HSP90 function represents a unique strategy for destabilizing the mutant proteomes of cancer
cells to reveal them to the immune system. While numerous HSP90 inhibitors have been tested clinically as a
means to disrupt oncogenic signaling and kill cancer cells, none have been FDA approved. Preliminary data
demonstrate that in contrast to clinically tested dosing strategies, continuous, low dose exposure to HSP90
inhibitors stimulates MHC-I antigen presentation and drives anti-tumor immune responses in a syngeneic
mouse model through a mechanism that is fundamentally distinct from high dose HSP90 inhibitor treatment.
However, the mechanism of MHC-I induction and the relationship between HSP90 clients and MHC-I antigens
is unknown. Using pharmacological, genetic, and proteomic tools, this proposal will uncover the mechanism
driving MHC-I induction following low dose HSP90 inhibitor treatment. Furthermore, experiments in genetically
engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer will investigate the consequences of
this treatment strategy on antigen presentation and anti-tumor immune responses in vivo. Taken together, this
study will evaluate low dose HSP90 inhibition as a mechanistically distinct method to induce MHC-I antigen
presentation and reveal mutated cancer cell proteomes to the immune system, and also provide support for
repurposing orally bioavailable HSP90 inhibitors as a new class of immunomodulatory agents.
 This proposal also outlines career objectives and goals in preparation for obtaining a faculty position.
Notably, the career development plan identifies key areas for training in tumor immunology, animal modeling,
mentorship of trainees, and oral and written scientific communication. The training activities are designed to
build skills, both scientific and professional, that are required for running an independent laboratory. Finally, the
complementary expertise of the co-sponsors, the advisory team, and rich scientific environment at MIT are
uniquely suited to ensure success of the proposed research and career development goals.

10793131,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) continues to gain resistance to existing antibiotics, and the
lack of big pharma pipelines to develop new compounds that target superbugs means that serious attention is
needed within the academic research community. Although a limited number of compounds have been put forth
to address the MRSA resistance problem, there is still a critical need to develop novel compounds with improved
antibacterial activity. Synthetic unsaturated fatty acids (uFAs) are attractive candidates to become next-
generation antibacterial agents for treating MRSA infections because they appear to have multiple
mechanisms of action, making it more difficult for bacteria to develop resistance. In addition, synthetic
uFAs can directly kill multi-drug resistant bacteria at very low concentrations (i.e., at the micromolar and
nanomolar level). Recent experimental data suggest that the cytotoxic activity of either 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-
HDA, triple-bonded FA) or DAT-51(double-bonded FA) against MRSA is due to their ability to disrupt the cell
membrane, possibly by pore formation. The long-term goal of this project is to define the mechanisms that
explain the total antibacterial activity of uFAs and apply this knowledge to develop a next-generation of synthetic
uFAs with even better efficacy as antibacterial agents. Our central hypothesis is that uFAs such as 2-HDA or
DAT-51 can induce membrane disruption through direct pore formation. Two independent but related Specific
Aims proposed here will test our central hypothesis. In the first aim, we will determine if 2-HDA and/or DAT-
51 disrupt the cell membrane of S. aureus using flow cytometry, DNA/RNA leakage assays, and electron
microscopy. The second aim will define the inhibitory effects of 2-HDA or DAT-51 on S. aureus peptidoglycan
biosynthesis by using Western blot and standard colorimetric assays. The knowledge acquired from this project
will significantly impact the field because it will allow us to establish the chemical and biological foundations
required for the targeted design of the next generation of synthetic uFAs with improved antibacterial activity.
Therefore, the successful completion of this project is likely to lead to the development of new therapeutic options
to treat devastating MRSA infections."

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of bacterial infections in the United States, causing non-invasive
skin and soft tissue infections as well as invasive infections, including sepsis, pneumonia and necrotizing
fasciitis. In the Southwest US, the American Indian population is disproportionately affected by morbidity and
mortality related to S. aureus infections. Existing strategies have not been sufficient to control S. aureus
disease and new approaches are urgently needed. Through a partnership between the White Mountain
Apache Tribe, the Whiteriver Service Unit of the Indian Health Service, and the Johns Hopkins Center for
American Indian Health, the proposed research will design and evaluate a community-informed approach to
education and S. aureus decolonization to prevent S. aureus disease in high-risk individuals. In Year 1,
formative work will be completed to: 1) develop culturally tailored educational materials for prevention and early
recognition of S. aureus infections; and 2) assess the acceptability and feasibility of decolonization regimens in
a rural American Indian community. This will be accomplished through focus-group discussions and in-depth
interviews with key stakeholders, including healthcare providers and patients. At the end of the formative work,
we will have educational materials and a decolonization protocol tailored for American Indian communities to
optimize acceptability, adherence, and sustainability. In Years 2 to 4, the educational materials and
decolonization protocol will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of an
intermittent compared to a one-time decolonization protocol in decreasing S. aureus colonization and
preventing S. aureus infections. Adults at high risk for S. aureus infection attending the Whiteriver Service Unit
(index participants; n=200) will be enrolled along with their household members (n=1000) and followed for 12
months. Index participants will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to either: 1) education plus intermittent
decolonization (E+iD); or 2) education plus one-time decolonization (E+1D; control group). Index participants
randomized to the E+1D group will receive educational materials and one administration of the decolonization
protocol at the baseline visit only. Index participants randomized to the E+iD group will receive educational
materials at the baseline visit and will be provided with six administrations of the decolonization protocol to be
performed at the baseline visit and then every other month. Household members from groups will receive the
E+1D intervention. The primary outcome will be colonization among index participants 6 months after
randomization. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) prevalence of colonization among index participants at 12
months; and 2) incidence of S. aureus and all-cause infections among index participants at 6 and 12 months. If
found to be efficacious, this intervention could be broadly used in high burden patient populations to decrease
S. aureus-related morbidity and morbidity and address an important health-related disparity for American
Indian communities."

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the colon that affects roughly one million
Americans. UC is generally nonfatal and often occurs in the prime of life, potentially resulting in decades of
suffering, disability and lost productivity. The underlying mechanisms that lead to disease are poorly understood,
and there are no current medications that can ‘cure’ UC. Recently almost all patients with UC (but almost none
with Crohn’s disease or no IBD) have been found to make high titer antibodies to the integrin αvβ6. Furthermore,
anti-αvβ6 autoantibodies preceded clinical diagnosis of UC by upto 10 years, and were associated with increased
adverse outcomes, suggesting they may represent a fundamental prerequisite or cause of the pathogenesis of
UC. A major role for αvβ6 is the activation of the cytokine TGF-β, a major regulator of intestinal barrier function
and mucosal immune responses. We have spent many years investigating the role of αv integrins in activating
TGF-β to promote intestinal immunity and maintain homeostasis, and we have found that mice in which αvβ6 is
selectively deleted in the intestinal epithelium develop more severe intestinal inflammation in a colitis model, and
this is associated with changes in epithelial cell gene expression similar to those seen in UC. Based on these
data we hypothesize that intestinal epithelial αvβ6 activates TGF-β for autocrine and paracrine signaling to
promote intestinal immune homeostasis, and that disruption of αvβ6 function results in ‘pre-clinical’ UC in mice
and humans. In this project, we will make use of unique mouse models, human epithelial cell and organoid
cultures, and UC patient samples to test these hypotheses and determine the role of αvβ6 autoantibodies in IBD.
Successful completion of these experiments will define a role for epithelial cells as a nexus for regulation of TGF-
β activation in the intestine, and provide a critical understanding of the regulation of this cytokine in health and
disease."

Pneumonia is the most common cause of death due to infection worldwide and in patients admitted to the
intensive care unit (ICU). Some patients are successfully cured with a short course of antibiotics, but over a third
are not readily cured despite appropriate therapy and have worse outcomes. Current ICU prediction models
focus on remote outcomes, such as hospital mortality, and are not built to predict short term outcomes of
pneumonia episodes. These episodes evolve over days, which are the timeframe during which clinical
interventions can shift patient trajectories toward favorable outcomes. I developed a machine learning approach
called CarpeDiem based on the practice of daily physician rounds to disentangle the contributions of unresolving
pneumonia to poor outcomes in patients with respiratory failure. These data suggest identifying patients likely to
fail pneumonia treatment early in their clinical course could impact ICU outcomes.
In this proposal, I will build upon my previous CarpeDiem methodology to develop and validate a machine
learning model to predict whether a pneumonia episode will be cured on day 7 using features from days 1-3. I
will leverage the data from the Successful Clinical Response in Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) U19 Systems
Biology Center, a one-of-a-kind biorepository that includes over 700 patients and 1,400 bronchoalveolar lavages.
I will use both clinical electronic health record data and single-cell RNA sequencing transcriptomic data in my
models. My predictions and hypotheses are founded on causal biologic studies in murine models of lung injury
demonstrating the importance of regulatory T cells to promote pneumonia resolution. This proposal will give me
training in deep learning methods, deployment of machine learning models, and computational skills to analyze
high-dimensional single-cell transcriptomic data.
My project addresses critically important gaps in current modeling and predictors of pneumonia outcome and
will overcome current limitations in machine learning approaches to ICU data. I am supported by my mentors
Richard Wunderink, a world-renowned expert in pneumonia and critical care. My co-mentor Benjamin Singer
provides lung immunology expertise, and my co-mentor Yuan Luo provides expertise in machine learning. My
Research Advisory Committee includes experienced scientists in computational transcriptomics, electronic
health record modeling, database informatics, and lung immunology. My training plan leverages the unique
research environment at Northwestern University to grow my substantial track record while expanding my skills
in electronic health record and genomic data to support my academic development as a future R01 funded
investigator. Identifying early features of treatment failure provides targets for intervention, prompting additional
diagnostics, such as repeat bronchoalveolar lavage or imaging, or treatment modifications. Recognition of early
treatment failure offers the opportunity to divert a patient’s downward trajectory toward cure in critically ill patients."

Nerve injuries arising from trauma, disease, or as a surgical necessity, lead most often to permanent loss of
some or all functions mediated by the injured nerves. 50,000 peripheral nerve procedures are performed every
year in the US, and 300,000 across Europe. After complete transection of a nerve, the optimal clinical
procedure for nerve repair remains the surgical end-to-end reattachment of the injured nerve, aligning the ends
into as close to their original apposition as possible and without tension. This approach offers the best
possibility for efficient and effective axonal regeneration and functional recovery. For cases in which there is
damage that results in a gap that is too long for tensionless end-to-end repair, nerve grafts are used to support
the regeneration of axons. The degree of recovery of function with grafts decreases precipitously with
increases in either/both gap-length and the distance from the injury to the target tissues. Treatments that can
enhance the number of axons growing, the speed of their growth, and the gap-length they can span are
needed. The academic PI has identified a combination of growth factors that significantly and clinically-
meaningfully enhances each of these characteristics and can be encapsulated in polymer beads to enable
incorporation into grafts for extended-duration of release. The academic PI has demonstrated efficacy of this
system in a large animal model. This project aims to develop the fabrication procedures for growth factor
encapsulation and impregnation into nerve conduit grafts that could be used clinically. The goals include in
vitro and in vivo assessment of the fabricated grafts to validate that they remain effective. This work is
necessary to determine the commercial viability of the lab-proven technology."

 The SWI/SNF family ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are multi-subunit protein complexes that
dynamically position chromosomal nucleosomes to modulate DNA accessibility, transcription-factor binding,
and cell-type-specific gene expression. SWI/SNF function is crucial at several stages of mammalian
development, and recent human whole-genome and exome sequencing studies revealed striking mutational
frequencies in genes encoding SWI/SNF subunits across a range of diseases - from neurologic disorders to
over 20% of all cancers. Disease-associated SWI/SNF mutations often cause the loss of a protein subunit that
further destabilizes the complex and results in altered subunit composition and functions. Of note,
heterogeneity in SWI/SNF subunit composition is also observed naturally within and across cell types,
hypothesized to result in complex- and tissue-specific SWI/SNF functions. Despite their importance, how these
subunits determine the substrate preference and mechanistic functions of SWI/SNF complexes are not well
understood, largely due to the lack of robust approaches to characterize where they bind within the genome
and how they interact with chromatin genome-wide. Thus, the main goal of this proposal is to address this key
knowledge gap. Since chromatin remodelers directly interact with nucleosomes, it is important to clarify
remodeler-bound nucleosome compositions and structures. Standard biochemical characterization of soluble
components purified from cellular extracts cannot determine the nucleosome structures associated with
chromatin-bound complexes. It is also important to understand the kinetic parameters of remodeler-chromatin
interactions, such as how fast a remodeler is recruited to its target sites, and how long does it remain bound at
its genomic sites. The candidate proposes to address these questions by using structural and functional
epigenomics approaches and live-cell single-molecule imaging, to characterize remodeler-chromatin
interactions in the context of the complex and dynamic chromatin environment inside cells. Aim 1 is to
determine the genome-wide occupancy of SWI/SNF complexes with distinct subunit compositions. Aim 2 is to
determine a) the structures and histone composition of remodeler-bound nucleosomes genome-wide, and b)
the kinetic parameters of remodeler-chromatin interactions in live cells. Aim 3 is to study the interaction of
SWI/SNF with repressive chromatin. The mentored phase of this project will be completed under the
sponsorship of Dr. Steven Henikoff at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The candidate will
acquire training in live-cell single-molecule imaging under the supervision of Dr. Sheila Teves at the University
of British Columbia. The proposed research and training will provide a strong foundation for the candidate to
develop as an independent investigator, studying chromatin remodeling mechanisms and dynamics in the
regulation of fundamental cellular processes."

Autoimmune diseases exhibit strikingly increased prevalence in females (e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus
[SLE], female-to-male ratio 9:1), whereas in contrast, infectious diseases affect more men than women.
 Despite its clinical impact, the molecular underpinnings of sex-biased immune regulation remain elusive. To
address this knowledge gap, this project focuses on the immunometabolic function of VGLL3 (Vestigial Like
Family Member 3), a female-increased, keratinocyte-expressed molecule known to promote both cutaneous and
systemic autoimmunity. This project tests the hypothesis that VGLL3 coordinates female-biased metabolic
stress response, whose hyperactivation causes autoimmunity by:
Aim 1. Define the female-biased cellular stress response mediated by VGLL3.
Aim 2. Determine the molecular mechanism by which metabolic stress potentiates VGLL3 induction by
IFNα.
Aim 3. Establish the in vivo role of VGLL3-mediated stress response in autoimmune pathogenesis.
With successful completion of the work proposed, we will have gained insights into the molecular basis
underlying sexual dimorphism in immunity. By establishing the immunometabolic function of VGLL3, we will
demonstrate the importance of maintaining metabolic homeostasis in combating autoimmunity, and provide a
novel target and pathway for sex-specific prevention and treatment of immune-associated diseases."

extent of the impact of tropical cyclones on health. The objective of this K99/R00 application is to ﬁll this research
gap with several novel assessments of the health impacts of tropical cyclones. To be able to fulﬁl this objective,
this K99/R00 application is interdisciplinary, involving the collaboration of experts in environmental epidemiology,
exposure assessment, Bayesian statistics, machine learning, computer vision, and social epidemiology. The K99
phase is designed to augment the candidate's prior research experience through coursework, mentorship, and
directed readings, with speciﬁc training in (1) climate-related disaster epidemiology and exposure assessment;
(2) advanced Bayesian statistics methodology; (3) machine learning and computer vision for public health; and
(4) social epidemiology in a disaster and public health context. The skills gained during this award are critical to
the candidate's long-term goal to become a leading and methodologically strong environmental epidemiologist
who conducts rigorous large-scale research that contributes to society's understanding of tropical cyclones and
other environmental hazards to help inform policies in the United States and worldwide. The proposed project
will draw on rich data sources on hospitalization (Medicare and Medicaid cohorts); death (National Center for
Health Statistics); tropical cyclone exposure; and satellite- and ground-based imagery, all of which span several
recent decades and cover all of the United States exposed to tropical cyclones. Aim 1 (K99 phase) will improve
and harmonize estimation of excess hospitalizations and deaths after each named hurricane by (a) applying
an ensemble of Bayesian models to hospitalization and mortality data to estimate weekly hospitalization and
deaths rates that would have been expected had hurricane exposure not occurred; then (b) comparing the actual
historical hospitalization and death rates to calculate excess hospitalizations and deaths. Aim 2 (R00 phase)
will (a) determine the impact of repeated tropical cyclone exposure on chronic health outcomes by analyzing
the association between tropical cyclone exposure and monthly hospitalizations or deaths by applying Bayesian
spatio-temporal hazard models; then (b) accurately forecast health impacts by using results. Aim 3 (R00 phase)
will characterize how physical neighborhood features explain differences in health impacts of tropical cyclones by
(a) utilizing machine learning and computer vision techniques to identify various physical neighborhood features in
tropical cyclone-exposed areas using satellite and street-level imagery; then (b) converting features into metrics in
health models to investigate if and how health impacts of tropical cyclones vary by those metrics. The proposed
training and research program both closely align with NIEHS's mission and Strategic Plan, and is responsive
to NIEHS's priorities of Data Science and Big Data (Theme I, Goal 7), Environmental Health Disparities and
Environmental Justice (Theme II, Goal 4), and Emerging Environmental Health Issues (Theme II, Goal 5)."
10933567,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Patients injured in rural America are more likely to die than their urban counterparts. This is due in part to poor
access to specialized care such as regional trauma centers, and rural patients are more likely to be taken to a
non-trauma center as a result. For rural patients, air medical transport (AMT) by helicopter is the only way to
get timely access to life-saving trauma care because of poor geographic access to trauma centers. AMT brings
life-saving care otherwise unavailable from ground ambulances to the patient even before reaching a trauma
center and gets the patient to definitive care at a trauma center faster. AMT when used appropriately can
mitigate this under-triage and save lives after injury. In remote rural regions, use of AMT may also preserve
local emergency response resources for other patients. Unnecessary use of AMT – over-triage – occurs in up
to 60% of helicopter flights for patients with only minor injuries and is also more common in rural areas. A
major driver of this inaccurate triage for AMT is the lack of a standardize definition of what patients and/or
circumstances warrant the use of AMT, reflected in significant variation in the measures used in prior literature
for appropriate AMT. This makes it impossible to compared or build on prior work, representing a critical barrier
to improving air medical triage of rural patients. Inaccurate AMT triage disproportionally impacts patients in
underserved rural areas and has serious negative consequences: Under-triage of rural patients increases the
risk of death by not transporting them to a facility that can treat their injuries. Over-triage, unnecessary AMT,
increases cost, makes this scarce resource unavailable for other patients that need it, and increases risk to the
patient and the crew. AMT crashes are a serious safety issue with a third of crashes experiencing a fatality
compared to just 1% of ground ambulance crashes, an avoidable risk if the flight is unnecessary. Further, AMT
fees are over $10,000 per transport, creating a significant financial burden for patients and healthcare systems.
This proposal seeks to develop the first definition of AMT need after injury through consensus from multiple
diverse perspectives with experts in prehospital trauma care and regionalized care delivery. This project will
then validate the definition using actual patient outcomes. In Aim 1 we will use web-based real-time modified
Delphi methods to develop a consensus definition of criteria that warrant AMT after trauma. In Aim 2 we will
assess the multiple aspects of validity for our consensus definition of AMT need. We will solicit feedback from
rural EMS professionals to assess face validity and refine the definition. We will then assess criterion validity
by applying the definition to patients in a state trauma registry to assess outcomes among those that do and do
not meet the definition. This proposal is foundational to developing evidence-based air medical triage
guidelines and will inform future work using this consensus definition to prospectively validate, implement, and
pilot an air medical triage algorithm. Successful completion will improve outcomes and trauma care value,
reducing the disparities after injury in rural America by getting the right patients the right care at the right time."

Chronic pain and alcohol use disorders (AUD) are highly comorbid. People with chronic pain have an increased
likelihood to develop AUD than those without. Further, chronic pain and high pain intensity are associated with
elevated risk for relapse to alcohol use. Despite this, there is limited preclinical data on the neurobiological
substrates underlying relapse in the context of chronic pain. People with chronic pain report using alcohol to
alleviate pain and the accompanying psychosocial stress, which likely engages distinct neurocircuits to regulate
reward seeking. Our previous data in the spared nerve injury model of chronic neuropathic pain demonstrate
that ethanol effectively reduced allodynia – a hallmark symptom of chronic neuropathic pain – in both male and
female mice. Our preliminary data further identified facilitated pain-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking in
a conditioned place preference model in males with chronic pain as compared to their sham injured counterparts.
The prelimbic cortex (PL) – a subregion of the medial prefrontal cortex – is a common substrate in the regulation
of ethanol seeking and pain. The PL and its outputs are key regulators of reinstatement of reward seeking, a
model of relapse-related behavior. The PL also mediates both affective and cognitive components of chronic
pain in rodent models and is highly disrupted in patients with chronic neuropathic pain. This makes the PL a
promising target in investigation of ethanol seeking and reinstatement under conditions of chronic pain. Thus,
experiments in this proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that chronic pain alters ethanol relapse-
related behaviors and associated neurobiological substrates, with a focus on the PL and its subcortical
projections. To test the hypothesis that chronic neuropathic pain alters PL activity during relapse-related
behavior, Aim 1 will combine in vivo electrophysiology with behavioral analyses to investigate PL activity during
the acquisition and expression of ethanol conditioned place preference and pain-induced reinstatement in adult
male and female mice with a spared nerve injury. Further, as we have demonstrated that ethanol is antiallodynic
in the spared nerve injury model, the effect of ethanol on PL activity surrounding painful stimulation will be
characterized. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that discrete PL projections regulate reinstatement of ethanol
seeking. We will use chemogenetics to silence PL projections to the nucleus accumbens core or basolateral
amygdala, with the expectation that projections to the basolateral amygdala are necessary for pain induced
reinstatement but not ethanol-primed reinstatement in the context of chronic pain. Together, these experiments
will provide insight into the unique neurobehavioral niche mediating ethanol seeking and relapse-related behavior
under conditions of chronic pain. We expect that completion of this proposal will serve as a scaffold for
subsequent research into the neurobiological substrates of ethanol seeking."

 Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. With rapidly ris-
ing incidences in the last two decades, diabetes has been reported in over 20% of hospitalized adult patients.
Glycemic control plays an important role to help reduce hospital complications, mortality, and health care cost
for these patients. To achieve optimal glycemic control, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), which evaluates
interstitial glucose every 1–5 minutes, offers many advantages over the traditional point of care (POC) capillary
glucose testing before meals and at bedtime, including: a panoramic view of glycemic proﬁles, real-time detec-
tion of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, remote glucose management, and lower care labor and cost. With the
fast growing utilization of CGM for inpatient diabetes management, developing effective and robust statisti-
cal methods tailored to translate the abundant data from CGM to sound clinical decisions is of timely
importance; however, this area is largely unexplored.
 From closely working on a series of multi-center clinical studies that investigated the reliability, safety, and
efﬁcacy of CGM for inpatient use, we recognize substantial barriers for the existing analytic approaches
for CGM data to meet this critical need. These include inadequately accounting for special data issues in
inpatient CGM studies, and inefﬁcient use of the rich information from CGM to inform more individualized
diabetes care. Speciﬁcally, time-in-range (TIR), deﬁned as the percentage of time that glucose readings are
within a target glycemic range over a speciﬁed amount of time, is a key metric for evaluating glycemic control
based on CGM. To evaluate TIR in the hospital setting, a prevalent issue is that some patients are discharged
before sufﬁcient CGM data are captured. As inpatient glucose excursion patterns can be highly variable over time,
current data analyses that simply impute TIR based on the shorter, incomplete glucose monitoring can lead to
biased inferences on TIR. Another notable caveat relates to the assessment of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia,
which plays an important role in treatment decisions. Existing analyses mainly use the counts of these events
but waste the valuable timing information that is uniquely available in CGM studies. This leads to a missed
opportunity for detailed individual proﬁling and dynamic prediction of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia risk that
can help guide customized inpatient care of diabetes. In this application, we aim to ﬁll in these gaps through
(i) developing rigorous statistical methods that are elegantly suited to thoroughly evaluate TIR and other
similar key outcomes with the special data complications in hospital CGM studies properly addressed; (ii)
broadening the paradigm of current CGM data analyses with a new framework of analyzing hypoglycemia
and hyperglycemia outcomes that effectively utilizes the timing information and confers a much improved
view of individual risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The proposed methods will be applied to the
several inpatient CGM studies, and user-friendly software will be developed."
10812635,"The five-year survival rate for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains less than 50% and nearly all patients
eventually succumb to the disease; therefore, understanding pro-metastatic mechanisms for adjuvant therapy
resistant breast cancer (BC) remains a critical unmet need in the field. Our long-term goal is to elucidate adaptive
changes that enable BC cells to persist and recur as metastatic disease and to reveal new therapeutic
vulnerabilities. The standard of care adjuvant therapy for estrogen receptor alpha positive (ER+) BC in
postmenopausal women (the most common form of the disease) is estrogen (E2)-deprivation achieved through
aromatase inhibitors (AI). AI therapy blocks conversion of androgens to E2, effectively decreasing E2 production,
but increases circulating and intra-tumoral androgens. The Richer laboratory has published extensively on
mechanisms by which androgen receptors (AR) interact with driving pathways in the three main BC subtypes.
Recently, the Yu laboratory independently discovered that AR supports tumor cell survival under cellular stress
incurred by E2-deprivation (simulating AI therapy) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) incurred by anchorage
independence and may thereby facilitate relapse as metastatic disease. Indeed, the two labs independently
discovered that AR is further elevated in BC cells with ER hot spot mutations that are exclusively detectable in
MBCs following resistance to AI therapy. Since surviving E2-deprivation therapy and anchorage independence
is critical to metastatic progression of ER+ BC, understanding the role of AR in these conditions is highly relevant
for MBC. It is known that a critical barrier for circulating tumor cell (CTC) survival during metastasis is to overcome
the high level of ROS in anchorage independent conditions. These data led to our hypothesis that AR promotes
reduction of ROS and CTC survival thereby promotes metastasis. We combine expertise of AR signaling (Richer)
and metastasis (Yu) and use mutant ER BC cell lines, patient derived CTC lines, patient derived xenografts
(PDX), and murine syngeneic models to test the following aims. We will evaluate the role and mechanisms of
AR upregulation during estrogen deprivation and anchorage-independent survival of ER mutant BC cells, by
examining the ROS levels impacted by AR activity, AR binding profile and downstream targets in vitro, as well
as the mechanism for AR upregulation in anchorage independent condition (Aim 1). We will examine the
contribution and mechanisms of AR mediated pro-metastatic signals in vivo, via evaluating the impact of AR
inhibition on metastatic potential in mutant ER cells, the AR levels in CTCs and metastasis, as well as the binding
profiles of AR and the role of its downstream targets in promoting metastases (Aim 2). This application is aimed
to determine how AR supports ER mutant BC to resist stresses incurred during metastatic progression, with the
goal of devising better therapeutic strategies to reduce mortality from MBC."
10812816,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neurocognitive deficits represent a core component of several major neuropsychiatric disorders, including
schizophrenia, affective disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and
are not merely an epiphenomenon reflecting symptom severity, environmental deprivation, or medication side
effects. The centrality of cognition to mental health is reflected in the RDoC matrix, in which “Cognitive
Systems” is one of the six fundamental domains of investigation. Moreover, cognitive deficits are associated
with poor functional outcomes, and are generally not well treated by existing psychotropic medications. Based
on family studies and longitudinal observations, it has long been recognized that cognitive abnormalities are (to
a significant degree) genetically mediated endophenotypes of serious mental illnesses. The Cognitive
Genomics Consortium (COGENT), led by the PI of this application, has conducted a series of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of cognitive phenotypes, which have confirmed the significant genetic overlap
between cognitive performance and most forms of psychiatric illness at the molecular level.
During five years of NIMH funding, this project has resulted in 13 publications, including the largest cognitive
GWAS to date (N=373,617 yielding 241 significant loci) and the first large exome study identifying rare variants
associated with cognitive performance in the general population. Moreover, we applied novel approaches to
dissecting the pleiotropy observed between cognition and psychopathology, identifying “meta-loci” which are
regions of the genome that underly specific patterns of pleiotropic overlap between phenotypes. This work has
yielded new treatment targets, as well as biological insights on a dissociation between neurodevelopmental
(prenatal) pathways vs adult synaptic processes underlying distinct forms of cognitive function and dysfunction.
Over the next five years, we propose three main aims to extend our previous work, with an emphasis on
biological interpretability and potential clinical applicability of results. First, we will add new, ethnically diverse
cohorts for further cognitive GWAS and rare variant analysis, and we will seek to identify key subdomains of
cognitive function for further downstream analysis. Second, we will incorporate these cognitive subdomains as
well as newly available, large-scale neuroimaging genomics data in a novel set of analyses, derived from our
“meta-loci” approach, to parse psychiatric phenotypes into biologically coherent subcomponents. Third, we will
construct novel, biologically-informed polygenic risk scores (PRS) and test whether these have greater
prognostic value as compared to conventional, genome-wide PRS based on single-trait GWAS. Thus, our plan
leverages diverse large-scale genomics resources, and a range of expertise, to derive actionable information
(novel treatment targets, biological mechanisms, and biomarkers) relating to a range of psychiatric disorders."
10933557,"SUMMARY
Cocaine use is endemic nationwide. According to a national survey, over 2.5% of the population of individuals
12 years and older reported crack or cocaine use in the past year, accounting for over 10,000 deaths related to
cocaine overdose. Recent data suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated substance use in the
United States. Only a small minority of cocaine users seek formal treatment for their addiction, and even in those
who do, the relapse rate remains disturbingly high with some studies reporting rates as high as 90%, 12 months
after treatment. Relapse in addicted individuals is presumed to precipitate from the re-exposure to cues that
were previously associated with drug use. Over the course of chronic drug use, these cues are afforded
enhanced attention (or attention-bias), which has shown to promote motivated arousal, culminating in compulsive
drug-seeking or relapse. We have used the late positive potential (LPP), an EEG-derived marker of motivated
arousal to show that, unlike commonly believed, arousal to drug cues (or cue-reactivity) increases (or incubates)
during the first six months of abstinence. Such incubation of cue-reactivity is posited to confer disproportionately
high relapse vulnerability in addicted individuals. Our recently acquired follow-up data show that addicted
individuals are able to down-regulate drug cue-reactivity (as evident via a decrease in LPP amplitude) via
cognitive reappraisal (an emotion-regulation technique) training, which then leads to a reduction in spontaneous
attention-bias to drug cues (quantified using eye-tracking). Here, we propose to integrate the two pieces of
evidence to test whether cognitive reappraisal training can reduce the incubation of drug cue-reactivity (Aim 1)
and improve clinical outcomes (e.g., reduce craving and prolong cocaine abstinence duration; Aim 2) during the
first 6 months of abstinence in individuals with cocaine use disorder (iCUD). We will further explore whether
changes in attention-bias to drug cues and/or blunting of incubation of cue-reactivity tracks treatment response
and predicts clinical outcomes at 6 months follow-up (exploratory aim). For this purpose, we propose to enroll
126 iCUD, half of whom will be randomized to undergo cognitive reappraisal training and the other half will
instead complete a control task. In this longitudinal study, participants will complete these procedures at 1-week,
1-, 3-, and 5-months post abstinence initiation, and will then come back one month after (at 6 months post
abstinence initiation) for the assessment of clinical outcomes. Thus, this novel study aims to bridge between the
lab and the clinic by advancing basic mechanistic understanding of a novel evidence-based intervention to
provide cognitive markers for tracking treatment response and predicting outcomes in addiction. Successful
completion of this study would lay the foundation for further basic and clinical studies that will examine other
putative mechanisms and potentially also use the same framework for the neurocognitive examination of similar
cognitive interventions in other substance use disorders as well as in other behavioral addictions."
10816061,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia and cleft lip/palate (AEC) and ectrodactyly ectodermal dysplasia and cleft
lip/palate (EEC) are two ectodermal dysplasias. AEC and EEC are caused by mutations in the transcription factor
TP63. TP63 is known to be essential for the development and maintenance of the epidermis and epidermal
appendages. TP63 mutations in AEC and EEC (TP63-AEC and TP63-EEC) lead to epidermal phenotypes,
including skin fragility. To develop therapeutic options, it is essential to understand the pathological mechanisms
leading to these devastating manifestations. My preliminary data suggest that different mechanisms contribute
to TP63-AEC and TP63-EEC skin pathology. TP63-AEC keratinocytes downregulate integrins required for
extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion while TP63-EEC keratinocytes do not. Further, TP63-AEC keratinocytes
also show reduced ECM adhesion and migration, suggesting a possible link between integrin defects and
abnormal keratinocyte behavior. TP63-AEC keratinocytes also demonstrated reduced epidermal differentiation
while TP63-EEC keratinocytes displayed accelerated differentiation. Based on these observations, I
hypothesize that adhesion and differentiation defects contribute to the epidermal phenotype observed
in AEC and EEC patients. In order to study the molecular pathology underlying AEC and EEC, I will generate
human NTERT keratinocyte lines expressing TP63-AEC and TP63-EEC mutant proteins. NTERT keratinocytes
display normal keratinocyte behavior and can differentiate in 2D and 3D systems. Aim 1 will establish a
mechanistic link between specific integrins and their contribution to TP63-AEC keratinocyte adhesion and
migration defects. Aim 2 will address the apparent different mechanisms between TP63-AEC and TP63-EEC. I
will generate epidermal equivalents expressing TP63-AEC or TP63-EEC proteins and use immunofluorescent
staining and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to identify differences in various subpopulations of
differentiating keratinocytes. The current proposal aims to determine the mechanistic consequences of TP63-
AEC and TP63-EEC mutations on keratinocyte ECM adhesion and epidermal differentiation. This work has the
potential to lead to the identification of novel disease pathways, and might lead to the discovery of novel
therapeutic targets."
10817743,"Project Summary/Abstract
This objective of this proposal is to develop new synthetic methods for the enantioselective synthesis of bioactive
molecules. Studies are centered on utilizing a new class of atropisomeric chiral biaryl ligand being developed in
our laboratory. Preliminary work has found that imidazole-based biaryl P,N-ligands excel at promoting
enantioselective copper catalyzed carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions. Our goal is to capitalize on the
differences in behavior between these ligands and existing biaryl ligands to enable new reaction technology for
applications in discovery chemistry. The research in this application is focused on gaining a mechanistic
understanding of the structural underpinnings responsible for new and unique reactivity imparted by this new
ligand scaffold. Our first aim outlines plans to develop new dearomatization reactions of nitrogen heterocycles.
In this aim we describe chemistry that will push the field past chiral carbocycles and single-heteroatom
heterocycles to heterocycles with >1 heteroatom. Through preliminary results we demonstrate addition to
pyridine, but more importantly pyrazine, pyridazine, and pyrimidine. These latter examples are unprecedented
in the literature and the success of these catalytic enantioselective dearomatization reactions is developed here
to provide rapid access to complex natural products like svetamycin B, saxitoxin, and batzellidine B as well as
additional chiral nitrogen-containing building blocks. The second aim is focused on catalytic enantioselective
addition reactions to C=N Bonds independent of nitrogen substitution. In catalytic enantioselective processes,
it is common for iminium ions to require 2 identical N-substituents to avoid the E/Z issue. We have found that
catalytic enantioselective alkynylation using StackPhos lifts this requirement and the use of two different N-
substituents is possible. This breakthrough allows the move from bis-protected amines (e.g. N,N-dibenzyl) to the
incorporation of groups needed for the synthesis. Here we capitalize on this for an expedient synthesis of
kopsanone and other chiral heterocycles such as morpholines. In addition, through preliminary results, we also
demonstrate that addition to imines and nitrones in high ee is possible, despite the E/Z-isomer issue. Extensive
preliminary results support these aims and we predict that the chemistry developed here will be of broad impact
to practitioners in academia and industrial settings, particularly the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors."

Research: Actinic keratoses (AKs) are pre-cancerous skin lesions that arise in the setting of chronic sun
exposure and affect tens of millions of people in the United States each year. AKs have a risk of transformation
to cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. The majority of AK clinical care and research focuses on the individual
AK and its risk of malignant transformation. However, there is evidence that the presence of AKs may be
associated with increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma and other types of skin cancer (melanoma and
basal cell carcinoma) for the patient as a whole. Though they are not typically used this way, AKs may be an
important clinical biomarker of skin cancer risk, including melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell
carcinoma. Unfortunately, there are no specific recommendations for clinicians to follow for skin cancer
surveillance or early detection in patients with AKs. This project will address key knowledge gaps: to examine
the absolute risks of skin cancer in patients with AKs, which are unknown (Aim 1); to understand the care
currently being provided to patients with AKs, which is uncharacterized (Aim 2); and to develop a skin cancer
risk prediction model for patients with AKs, which has not previously been done (Aim 3). The overarching goal
is to provide evidence to guide clinical care and form the foundation for future recommendations on skin cancer
surveillance and early detection in patients with AKs, a large and high-risk group. Candidate: Dr. Mackenzie
Wehner, MD MPhil is an Assistant Professor of Health Services Research and of Dermatology at MD
Anderson Cancer Center. She completed her undergraduate degree at Yale University, medical school at
Stanford University, a Master's in Epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, and residency and post-
doctoral research fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania. Her career goal is to become an independent,
R01-funded physician scientist in patient-oriented skin cancer research and through her research to decrease
the burden of skin cancer in the United States. Environment: During this award period Dr. Wehner will devote
at least 75% of her time to research and 20% to clinical care of patients at high risk of skin cancer, including
those with AKs. Her primary mentor, Dr. Sharon Giordano, and co-mentor, Dr. David Margolis, are proven
mentors and experts in patient-oriented research in cancer. The exceptional training environment in cancer
research at MD Anderson will offer Dr. Wehner an outstanding opportunity to launch her career as an
independent physician-scientist. Career Development: Dr. Wehner will have support from an experienced and
diverse advisory committee and will focus her training on developing skills and experience in 1) health services
research and large administrative datasets, 2) risk prediction modeling and tools development, and 3)
incorporating genetic data in epidemiologic analyses. Completion of the proposed research and career
development plan will serve as a platform upon which Dr. Wehner can successfully transition to independence
and pursue an impactful career focused on patient-oriented skin cancer research."

and translational studies in the Columbia University Digestive and Liver Disease Research Center (CU-DLDRC).
The CBRC will provide research navigation services to its members to access extensive collections and storage
of digestive organ biospecimens. This resource will also combine biospecimen collection and analysis with
comprehensive clinical data elements. In concert with other CU-DLDRC Biomedical Cores, CBRC will enable
state-of-the-art single cell, imaging and organoid modelling-based analyses of its biospecimens through multi-
core workflows, thereby linking to the central theme “Epithelial Cells and Their Interactions in Digestive
Homeostasis and Disease” in human relevant settings. Through collaborative agreements with established
structures in the Cancer Center and Human Immune Monitoring cores, we will offer subsidized services such as
single nucleus RNA-sequencing, tissue microarrays, expert histopathological examination and biostatistical
support, thereby enhancing the capability of the CU-DLDRC to conduct impactful translational research.
Collaborative translational research and cross-fertilization between clinical and basic investigators in the CU-
DLDRC will be fertilized through a central infrastructure and consultative services for clinical research design
and application under the umbrella of organ-specific clinical-basic teams. The organ-specific clinical-basic teams
will support the analysis of CBRC-provided biospecimens in the CU-DLDRC biomedical cores through combined
clinical and basic expertise and dialogue, and vice versa, will bring novel basic research concepts from bench to
beside. The CBRC will led by two highly qualified NIH-funded clinical investigators, Dr. Julian Abrams (Director)
and Dr. Elizabeth Verna (Associate Director). The following Specific Aims will maximize benefits and added value
to CU-DLDRC members and contribute to the mission of the CU-DLDRC: To provide comprehensive biobanking
of digestive organ biospecimens with linked clinical data (Aim 1); to enable state-of-the-art translational analyses
of clinical samples (Aim 2); and to provide tailored human subjects research training, education, and biostatistical
support (Aim 3). According to user surveys, 96% of CU-DLDRC researchers plan to utilize CBRC services. In
conclusion, the CBRC will provide a crucial interface between clinical and basic CU-DLDRC investigators that
does not exist in this form at Columbia and promote high quality collaborative translational research through
access to a wealth of biospecimens. Through these services, the CBRC will provide major benefits to basic and
clinical CU-DLDRC researchers alike."

diseases. Single cell-based and spatial transcriptomics in conjunction with innovative bioinformatic analyses are
transforming our ability to understand dynamic and multidimensional biological processes in digestive diseases
and provide deep insights into the complex cell-cell, ligand-receptor and gene regulatory networks that regulate
health and disease. BSCAC will provide state-of-the-art analyses of human and murine sequencing data that go
far beyond the capability of most individual CU-DLDRC labs. For this, the BSCAC will provide its members with
digestive organ-focused analyses of bulk, single-cell (sc), single-nucleus (sn) and single-organoid RNA-
sequencing (RNA-seq), scATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics, as well as innovative analyses of cell-cell
interactions and transcriptional master regulators. Understanding these processes may provide novel
opportunities for diagnosis and/or therapeutic interventions. Through multi-core workflows that link the BSCAC
to the Clinical Biobanking & Research Core (CBRC), the Organoid& Cell Culture Core (OCCC) and Bioimaging
Core (BIC) for analyses of patient, cell and organoid samples, the BSCAC will enable translational and multi-
disciplinary research. BSCAC will significantly benefit the CU-DLDRC and its members by (i) providing cost-
effective and prioritized access to state-of-the-art analyses; (ii) empowering CU-DLDRC researchers to perform
cutting-edge research on digestive tract epithelial biology, homeostasis and interactions, there closely linking to
the central theme of the CU-DLDRC; (iii) contributing a platform for translational research and collaboration
between clinical and basic researchers; and (iv) educating and training CU-DLDRC members, Pilot and
Feasibility awardees, and their labs in innovative technologies and novel developments in this rapidly evolving
field. The BSCAC will be led by scientists with strong track records in bioinformatics and single cell analysis. Dr.
Peter Sims, Associate Professor of Systems Biology, will serve as director and Dr. Robert Schwabe, Professor
of Medicine, as associate director. BSCAC will be a highly utilized resource with 92% of CU-DLDRC members
indicating use in surveys. BASCAC will contribute to the CU-DLDRC’s mission through these interrelated Specific

culture systems for modeling of gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases. These systems include
primary culture, genetically-engineered cell lines, spheroids and organoids as well as 3D co-culture. OCCC
platforms will benefit the majority of clinical and basic CU-DLDRC investigators, providing powerful tools to study
epithelial cells and their interactions in digestive homeostasis and disease, the central theme of the CU-DLDRC.
Directed by Drs. Hiroshi Nakagawa, MD, PhD and Kelley Yan, MD, PhD, two scientists with long-standing
complementary expertise in advanced cell culture and organoids, the OCCC will provide services, technologies,
quality control and cost-effectiveness to the CU-DLDRC investigators, including the Pilot and Feasibility grant
recipients. The OCCC will provide a rich repository of cell lines and human and mouse organoids that are well
annotated for identity, passage number, and Mycoplasma infection-free status, thereby providing quality control,
rigor and reproducibility. The OCCC will also assist CU-DLDRC investigators to generate 3D organoids from
their human and mouse tissues as well as from inducible pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, to analyze growth,
morphology, gene expression, and cell-cell interactions via co-culture experiments. The OCCC will integrate
advanced cell culture technologies for manipulating genome and gene expression via CRISPR/Cas9, RNA
interference, and inducible retroviral/lentiviral gene expression vectors in cell and organoid-based systems.
These approaches are further enhanced by coordinated multi-core workflows with the Clinical Biospecimen and
Research Core for patient- and disease-specific organoids; with the Bioinformatics and Single Cell Analysis Core
for the plate-RNAseq-based CRISPR and drug screens; and with the Bioimaging Core for functional visualization
of cells and organoids. The OCCC will promote the mission of the CU-DLDRC through the following interrelated
Specific Aims: To provide CU-DLDRC members and their laboratories with cell lines, advanced cell culture
platforms and technologies (Aim 1); to build and expand unique CU-DLDRC and national repositories of disease-
specific human and mouse 3D organoid libraries (Aim 2); and to enhance the technical capabilities of new and
established CU-DLDRC investigators through training on cell and organoid culture models and as well as
educational seminars on novel developments (Aim 3). The OCCC will be highly utilized with 71% of CU-DLDRC
members indicating use, most of them use of multiple OCCC services. In summary, the OCCC will provide highly
efficient and cost-effective services and unique models that do not currently exist in CU-DLDRC members’

The Bioimaging Core (BIC) in the Columbia University Digestive and Liver Disease Research Center (CU-
DLDRC) will make essential contributions for the understanding and treatment of digestive diseases. State-of-
the-art imaging can resolve the complex interactions between cells, organs, metabolites and microbiota that
regulate digestive health and disease. However, the cost and expertise of maintaining and operating complex
imaging platforms are beyond the financial and technical means of most individual laboratories. The overall goal
of the BIC is to provide CU-DLDRC members with state-of-the-art imaging platforms to study mechanisms of
digestive health and disease in small animals and human biospecimens in vitro and in vivo, providing resolutions
ranging from nanometers to centimeters. The BIC is organized into two units with high-end digestive-focused
imaging capabilities backed by expert technical assistance, each led by a highly qualified director with
longstanding experience in imaging and core administration. The Microscopy Unit, overseen by BIC Co-Director
Liza Pon, provides access to a sophisticated suite of microscopes, including single, multiphoton and spinning
disk confocal, super-resolution and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, which allow rapid and high-
resolution imaging of living or fixed digestive tissue specimens. The Small Animal Imaging Unit, overseen by BIC
director Ken Olive, provides access to high-end magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, X-ray computed
tomography, and optical imaging instruments for imaging of digestive organs and their functions in small animals.
In addition, the BIC will develop new digestive-focused imaging modalities, including (i) imaging mass
spectrometry with CU-DLDRC member Brent Stockwell for high resolution imaging of metabolites in digestive
tissue; and (ii) SCAPE imaging, a novel meso-scale optical platform based on endogenous tissue fluorescence,
engineered by CU-DLDRC member Elizabeth Hillman. The Small Animal Imaging unit will also develop novel
applications specific for the assessment of gastrointestinal motility, fibrosis, inflammation, tracking of engineered
microbes, and in vivo measurement of metabolites. The BIC will contribute to the overall mission of the CU-
DLDRC through the following interrelated Aims: To analyze cellular structures and processes that regulate
epithelial health in digestive tissues via microscopy (Aim 1); to provide in vivo small animal imaging technologies
for the study of digestive physiology and disease (Aim 2); and to provide hands-on training and education in
advanced digestive imaging applications (Aim 3). BIC will be a highly utilized resource with 43 out of the 49 CU-
DLDRC members (88%) planning to use its services. Via multicore workflows, BIC will closely link to the other
CU-DLDRC biomedical cores, thus providing CU-DLDRC members with easy access to imaging clinical
biospecimens and organoids, or combining their imaging with advanced bioinformatics analyses. In sum, BIC
will benefit the research of basic and clinical CU-DLDRC members and provide significant value added."

in order to gather sufficient data to develop research programs and grant applications for peer-reviewed
extramural funding. The P/F awards fund different tracks, in prioritized order. Track 1: New investigators seeking
initial support. Track 2: New or established investigators aiming to pursue innovative high-risk, high-reward
projects in digestive disease. Track 3: Established investigators from other fields who seek to apply their
expertise to research in digestive disease. The P/F Program will be highly synergistic with other translationally
and clinically focused intramural internal funding mechanisms at CUIMC. P/F awardees will enjoy additional
benefits that will substantially promote their research, including Biomedical Core subsidies that go far beyond
the funding duration; integration into our comprehensive academic mentorship program via the Enrichment
Program integration as well as into CU-DLDRC activities in research and education such as clinical-basic teams,
workshops and seminars. The P/F program will contribute to the mission of the CU-DLRDC through three
Specific Aims: To solicit and rigorously peer review applications, thereby supporting highly innovative research
as well as rising stars in digestive research (Aim 1); to maximize the success of P/F-funded researchers through
opportunities for scientific interactions, education, training and mentorship as well as CU-DLDRC core subsidies
(Aim 2); and to provide efficient oversight of P/F program outcomes through long-term tracking of awardees
publications and grants (Aim 3). We anticipate the P/F program to enhance the development of the highly diverse
basic and clinical talent and to promote innovative impactful science beyond the horizon of current digestive
research. These three Aims will be under the goal of increasing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), through
collaboration with the Enrichment Program, its DEI delegate and the wide range of DEI resources at Columbia.
We have achieved initial success already, leveraging CU-DLDRC and institutional collaborations and resources."
10818430,"SUMMARY
The Columbia University Digestive Disease Research Center (CU-DLDRC) seeks to promote the understanding
of digestive disease through a wide range of scientific, educational and training activities for its members and
their trainees. The CU-DLDRC Enrichment Program (EP) is designed to provide opportunities for inter-
disciplinary and inter-departmental collaboration, training and education and will utilize a rich array of resources
in the CU-DLDRC and at Columbia University. Since 2019, the EP, together with the Administrative Core, has
arranged over 50 highly attended seminars and two retreats. Through these activities have provided CU-DLDRC
members with a central forum to present their data, and engage in exchange with the outside scientific world, in
particular other DDRCCs. In addition to featuring prominent speakers, the seminar series and Annual Retreat
have also highlighted the work of Pilot and Feasibility Awardees, new investigators and CU-DLDRC trainees. To
complement scientific education through hands-on-training on core-related techniques, the EP has started
working with biomedical cores for annual workshops and educational seminars that update members on core-
related science and technologies. Two additional activities of the EP are a mentoring program for new
investigators and Pilot and Feasibility awardees as well as mini-sabbaticals allowing members or trainees from
their labs to visit outside DDRCCs with complementary or synergistic methodologies. All above activities will be
under the goal of promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) in the CU-DLDRC. Two scientists with a strong
track record in digestive science, administration and DEI will lead the EP: Dr. Jianwen Que, MD, PhD, Professor
of Medicine, will serve as the EP Director, Dr. Rebecca Haeusler, Associate Professor of Pathology & Cell
Biology, as Associate Director and DEI delegate. The directors seek to realize the mission of the EP through the
following interrelated Specific Aims: To foster education and a collaborative environment in the CU-DLDRC, the
EP will oversee the biweekly seminars series (Aim 1A), an annual retreat (Aim 1B), and biannual symposia for
its three organ-focused clinical-basic teams (Aim 1C). To enhance the training of CU-DLDRC members in core-
related technologies and core navigation, the EP will organize hands-on workshops and seminars for the
Biomedical Cores (Aim 2). To promote the careers of trainees, new investigators, Pilot and Feasibility Awardees
and, especially, underrepresented minorities, the EP will provide career and grants development workshops
(Aim 3A); oversee a formal mentorship program (Aim 3B); publicize grant and training opportunities (Aim 3C);
and promote DEI in the CU-DLDRC through a DEI delegate (Aim 3D). Finally, the EP will increase scientific
education and training through mini-sabbaticals and participation in local, regional and national conferences
together with other DDRCCs, institutions and organizations (Aim 4). These activities will benefit CU-DLDRC
member, synergize with other components of the CU-DLDRC and contribute to its effectiveness."
10818440,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
ABSTRACT
 The Administrative Core provides the administrative infrastructure to coordinate and integrate the
research, facility cores, pilot projects, community engagement and career development activities of the
Harvard Chan - NIEHS Center for Environmental Health. It provides the oversight and leadership to assure the
productivity and effectiveness of the Center and its membership. It integrates cross-discipline research, fosters
multidisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborative research, and enriches the intellectual milieu of the
environmental health sciences at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the Harvard Longwood
Medical Campus, and the entire Harvard academic community. Moreover, it promotes translation of the
science to users in the local community and medical practitioners, and in turn facilitates participation of these
users in shaping the direction of Center research. It monitors and reports the accomplishments of the Center,
coordinates external evaluation, and coordinates with other NIEHS Environmental Health Core Centers, and
with the leadership at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.
 The Center Director works closely with the Administrative team consisting of the Deputy Director, and
the Center Administrator on day-to-day operations of the Center. An Executive Committee consisting of the
Center Director, Deputy Director plus the Directors of the Research, Facility, and Community Engagement
Cores, and the Career Development Coordinator meets monthly to coordinate and plan Center activities. An
Internal Advisory Committee of senior faculty across disciplines at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health
provides annual strategic review of Center outreach and activities. An External Advisory Committee of
distinguished senior leaders in environmental health provides regular strategic evaluation of the Center. In
addition, a Stakeholder Advisory Board of community leaders and health professionals provides regular
feedback of translation and interaction with end users.
 The Administrative team coordinates community building and enrichment activities including
communications (list-serve, website, newsletter), research enrichment (seminars, chalk-talks, workshops and
incubator sessions), integration (Colloquia, Whittenberger Lecture, Center Retreat), and Pilot Projects
(solicitation, review, and monitoring). In addition, the Administrative Team tracks, compiles, and reports Center
accomplishments such as publications, grants, investigator appointments, and promotions."
10818446,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
ABSTRACT
The Community Engagement Core will adopt a new approach to engagement in order to be responsive to the
new theme of the Harvard Chan School-NIEHS Center, Re-Envisioning Environmental Health: Integrating
Environmental Exposures of People and Place. Our main target stakeholders remain the community of
Dorchester and health/public health professionals. The aims for the CEC are to 1) develop a long-term model
of community engagement focused on dialogue, shared vision, and commitment to community-driven change;
2) foster initiatives and collaborations that address environmental health concerns expressed by community
partners and other stakeholders; and 3) to assess the effectiveness of our engagement with the community.
The new approach to engagement includes holding annual Engaging for Change workshops in the community
with community leaders, stakeholders and Center members present. The objectives of these workshops are to
highlight current exemplary practices related to mitigating environmental exposures and to define projects for
the coming year through facilitated discussions. A new 3-tiered funding mechanism to support community
organizations will provide funds for community projects at three different levels: Community Action Grants
($1K-3K), Facility Access Funds (up to $7,500) and pilot projects (up to $25K).
Multi-directional exchange between the community and the Center will be fostered through the Engaging for
Change workshops, the Stakeholder Advisory Board, interaction with the Research Core faculty plus
community participation in the incubator sessions, and utilization of the Facilities Cores for statistical analysis,
sample analysis, new data summaries, data visualization and GIS data mapping options in support of CEC
aims. Collaboration with NIEHS and the Disaster Recovery Research (DR2) Program will continue as will
collaboration with NIEHS Centers such as MIT and the University of North Carolina through the Cambridge
Science Festival and the Boston Area Health Education program, respectively. The Region 1 Pediatric
Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) and the Boston Public Health Commission will continue as
partners. A new collaboration with Harvard Law School will support the more integrated approach to exposures
i.e., to foster a “beyond science” approach to pollution problems and to increase the synergy between
environmental exposure mitigation and local laws and regulations.
The expanded membership of the Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) will increase community representation
and expand the scope of community expertise available to the Center. Similarly the expectation for SAB
participation has been augmented to include participation in annual workshops and project meetings."

The Administrative Core (AC), through shared leadership by Center Co-Directors Dr. Habibul Ahsan at the
University of Chicago (UofC) and Dr. Gail Prins at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), coordinates all
programmatic and research activities within the ChicAgo Center for Health and EnvironmenT (CACHET) and
implements its strategic vision. CACHET strives to achieve a strong identity in the City of Chicago and the State
of Illinois by promoting improved public health through reduced exposures to adverse environmental factors,
particularly within regions of racial/ethnic health disparities. In the renewal period, the AC will continue to provide
a centralized organizational infrastructure that integrates and coordinates all CACHET activities, recruits and
organizes members with excellent research capability in environmental health sciences (EHS) and builds inter-
institutional research programs across Focus Groups and trans-disciplinary research teams. The AC is
supported by effective management and oversight of Facility Cores to meet the evolving needs of EHS
investigators. The AC promotes translational research opportunities through CACHET Facility Cores, engaging
community stakeholders to advance bi-directional communications that drive targeted research efforts on
emerging environmental issues. Central to these endeavors are interactive education and communication
strategies for CACHET members, including seminars, retreats, workshops, multi-media platforms that
incorporate social media tools and an interactive website. The AC also facilitates career development of young
investigators through a robust Career Development Program and builds EHS research capacity through a vibrant
Pilot Project Program as well as targeted faculty recruitment. The AC management team maintains databases
for membership, Facility Core utilization logs, and careful record-keeping of all sponsored activities and
outcomes. Similarly, this support team works with the Directors to provide efficient operations and effective
management of financial and progress reports to the NIEHS. Oversight is maintained through regular meetings
of the Executive Committee and Internal and External Advisory Boards. The Directors will continue to act
promptly upon their recommendations to maintain and enhance Center programs. The AC furthers the CACHET
mission to mitigate environmental health disparities by developing strategic partnerships with university leaders,
local/regional/national Public Health officials, regional stakeholders, other NIEHS Core Centers and liaisons with
NIEHS program officials. Finally, the AC will strive to coordinate and integrate all Center research and activities
to provide a cohesive direction towards the CACHET goals/mission will."
10818449,"1. INTEGRATED HEALTH SCIENCES FACILITY CORE: ABSTRACT
The Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC) will provide infrastructure and highly focused trans-
disciplinary services to CACHET members including access to cohorts and bio-banking; environmental health
sciences (EHS) design, implementation and translational study services; innovative approaches to population
exposure estimation using both traditional and cutting-edge techniques including device, sensors and wearables
and mobile app technologies; and novel statistical services with a focus on challenges in geospatial modeling
and evaluation of mixtures. This array of services will provide tools to translate fundamental research into
knowledge supporting disease prevention and the mitigation of racial/ethnic environmental health disparities.
The IHSFC will have leadership at both University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and University of Chicago (UofC),
and will build upon the existing research resources at these institutions to ensure that Core support is used to
develop additional key resources for conducting EHS work. Many of the resources that the IHSFC uses to meet
the EHS translational research needs of CACHET investigators that exist at our two institutions have been
modified, enhanced, centralized and efficiently organized between the two institutions by leveraging the
institution-specific strengths and growing Core resources. IHSFC personnel include experts in epidemiological
study design, population and clinic-based studies, specimen collection and quality assurance, exposure
technology and data analytics to support superior exposure assessment, and statistical methods relevant for
modern environmental health studies. IHSFC personnel will collaborate with personnel in the Environmental
Biomarkers Facility Core (EBC) to address molecular assay requirements involving biomarkers of environmental
exposures and environmental signatures in human biological materials. The IHSFC will also provide
interpretation of results and facilitate dissemination of the results to Chicago communities and beyond in
conjunction with the Community Engagement Core (CEC). In addition, the IHSFC will work with the CEC as well
as relevant Institutional CTSA and Cancer Center Cores to translate community-based EHS questions and
concerns into specific scientific hypotheses that may be supported by CACHET through the Pilot Project Program
(PPP). Furthermore, the IHSFC will facilitate projects that utilize the Human Health Exposure Analysis Resource
(HHEAR), to further enhance CACHET opportunities to conduct expanded target and untargeted analyses of
environmental relevance."

The objective of this proposal is to optimize and validate the strain-programmed bioadhesive patch in compliance
with FDA regulatory guidance for the FDA IDE approval in advance of the future pivotal clinical trial and ultimate
regulatory clearance and commercialization. In light of the huge and rapidly growing clinical and economic costs
of chronic diabetic wounds and associated complications, various treatments including skin scaffolds and growth-
factor-based drugs have been proposed and clinically tested. To date, however, the existing approaches still
face several limitations for diabetic wound healing including limited therapeutic efficacy and/or high cost of
product/treatment. To address these limitations of existing solutions, during the prior development (Phase I-
equivalent), our collaborative team developed a proof-of-concept prototype of a strain-programmed bioadhesive
patch for enhanced diabetic wound healing by uniquely utilizing pro-regenerative mechanical modulation. The
preliminary pre-clinical validation and analysis based on in vivo db/db mice, diabetic porcine, and diabetic
humanized mice models revealed the promising therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of the strain-
programmed bioadhesive patch for the accelerated healing of diabetic cutaneous wounds. Building upon the
promising outcome of the prior development, under the scope of this Direct Phase II SBIR proposal, we will
further optimize and validate the strain-programmed bioadhesive patch in compliance with relevant FDA
regulatory guidance for the effective and broadly affordable treatment of chronic diabetic wounds such as DFU.
If successful, the proposed project will allow SanaHeal to prepare and submit the FDA IDE package in advance
to a pivotal clinical trial and ultimate commercialization with far-reaching benefits for patients and the healthcare
system."
10928212,"Project Summary
In this project we propose to develop and execute protocols for a nuclear imaging deposition study using either
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or, preferably, positron emission tomography (PET),
with the goal of supporting validation of in-silico models of deposition. These protocols, developed in
collaboration with the FDA, will be optimized to 1) collect data which may be used as input parameters for the
models which use this data for validation purposes and 2) leverage recent advances in SPECT and PET
technology to achieve images with significantly higher spatial and temporal resolution than was previously
possible. Building on approaches developed primarily by researchers Fleming, Montesantos, and Greenblatt, we
will develop methods to derive more accurate estimations of branch-level deposition from the resulting images
by 1) leveraging our experience in quantitative CT segmentation of lung structure, 2) making use of
improvements in image resolution to optimize radiotracer activity localization within airways as small as the 4th
generation, 3) localizing radiotracer activity within anatomic compartments of the lung as small as the segmental
level, and 4) more accurately reflecting disease-specific variations in airway morphology which violate key
assumptions of the work of Fleming and Montesantos.
These protocols will be developed and executed in collaboration with personnel from the Nuclear Medicine and
Radiology and Pharmacology faculty at Erasmus Medical Center as subawardees. These researchers will be
primarily responsible for developing, validating, and implementing a process to produce a radiolabeled
formulation of one orally inhaled drug product (OIDP) which is fit-for-use, as well as appropriate SPECT or PET
protocols optimized for the needs of the overall project. Healthy volunteers and subjects with asthma or COPD
will be recruited from a single center located in Kontich, Belgium. By recruiting subjects with asthma and COPD,
we hope to develop methods which can account for clinically significant differences in ventilation and deposition
which are not accounted for in previous work, specifically emphysema and gas trapping.
The resulting data, including 1) standardized protocols and procedures, 2) images acquired, 3) methods and
code, and 4) results of analysis will be made available to the FDA to disseminate publicly 18 months following
completion of the study, to meet the objective of providing data to facilitate in-silico model validation."
10818713,"Project Summary
Despite the public health impact of acute respiratory infections (e.g. the COVID pandemic), conferences focused
on lung infections are remarkably scant, making this Gordon Research Conference (GRC) titled Biology of Acute
Respiratory Infection which meets every 2 years particularly impactful. The theme for 2024 is Microbial and Host
Mechanisms Regulating Infection and Outcomes. This conference is designed to facilitate interaction and
collaboration between microbiologists, immunologists, pulmonologists, infectious disease physicians,
veterinarians, epidemiologists, public health officials, and others in related biomedical fields and at different
stages of their career, who do not usually attend the same meetings. It is purposely designed with speakers
working on bacterial, viral and fungal pathogen-induced pneumonia to allow for cross-disciplinary insights.
Important in the design of the conference is the integration of basic and applied scientists from academia,
industry and the government from around the world. The GRC is preceded by the Gordon Research Seminar
(GRS), a unique forum for trainees and early career scientists with comparable levels of experience to present
and exchange new data and cutting-edge ideas. The primary goals of the Biology of Respiratory Infections
GRC/GRS are to 1) to promote an interdisciplinary, coordinated approach to understanding and controlling acute
respiratory infections by integrating the scientific input from clinicians, public health, and basic scientists; 2) To
afford early career scientists multiple opportunities to present their work to leading world experts; and 3) provide
a forum to facilitate collaborations. A secondary goal is to provide training and career development opportunities
for both new faculty and trainees at the associated GRS and throughout the meeting. Interwoven in this goal is
opportunity for women and others from underrepresented groups to interact and develop relationships (e.g.,
mentors) with successful scientists from these same groups. These goals will be accomplished by organizing a
format where basic scientists meet and interact with physicians, public health officials, scientists from industry
and the government. The speaking program will include a diverse mixture of invited Senior and Junior Scientists
as well as speakers selected from submitted abstracts. In addition, there will be poster sessions where all
attendees will be encouraged to present. The venue and program are designed to encourage social interaction
and discussion outside of presentations to provide the opportunity for fruitful exchange of ideas and to enable
development of collaborations and future training opportunities. The GRC Power Hour™ remains an integral part
of the conference and is designed to address challenges women and others from underrepresented groups face
in science and issues of diversity and inclusion. It is an open forum for discussion and mentoring in a safe
environment that is open to all attendees. This meeting provides the single-most comprehensive venue for
discussing the latest advances in pneumonia biology. We have chosen presentations specifically to increase the
likelihood that attendees think differently and more creatively about their research endeavors."
10818742,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tobacco dependence represents a major public health challenge, and novel treatment approaches are urgently
needed. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are known to mediate the addictive action of nicotine, but it
has been difficult to know which aspects of nAChR function are involved in the behavioral and physiological
response to nicotine. In particular, the contribution of nAChR activation vs. desensitization to the establishment
and maintenance of nicotine reinforcement has remained unclear. We will leverage our unique experience with
nAChR molecular pharmacology and self-administration assays to address this issue. In Aim 1, we will design,
produce, and validate AAV vectors for expression of desensitization-resistant β2 and β4 nAChR subunits. We
will test several β2 and β4 variants with specific mutations at a conserved leucine residue in the 2nd
transmembrane ⍺-helix (i.e. the “pore-forming” ⍺-helix). Patch clamp electrophysiology will be used to
characterize the biophysical change induced by the mutation, and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy and
nicotine uncaging will verify proper trafficking of variant subunits in neurons. In Aim 2, we will study how
removal of β2 desensitization in VTA impacts nicotine self-administration and dopamine release. We will test
the hypothesis that a lack of desensitization will fundamentally alter nicotine's action as a reinforcer. We will
also determine how removal of desensitization from VTA β2* nAChRs impacts evoked dopamine release using
electrochemical methods. Together, these Aims will 1) produce/validate novel tools for nAChR research and 2)
help us understand how nAChR desensitization normally modulates nicotine reinforcement and associated DA
release. These vectors and their characterization in behavioral assays will lay the groundwork for future projects
related to nAChR physiology and pharmacology, and may also facilitate the development of novel tobacco
cessation treatments."
10933018,"Despite efforts to achieve UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, marked deficits remain in HIV testing, antiretroviral
therapy (ART) adherence, and viral suppression (VS) among a growing number of persons with HIV (PWH).
Gaps in HIV treatment success are particularly pronounced in the United States (US) Deep South. These
suboptimal HIV health outcomes occur at a time when clinicians have limited time and the US healthcare
system remains fragmented, further exacerbating the challenges inherent in the lives of underserved,
marginalized groups, such as PWH. In this way, the development and evaluation of interventions using a
resource-savvy cadre of community health workers (CHW) holds promise for addressing these challenges.
Yet, gaps exist in the CHW literature, and research is needed to bring CHW interventions to scale to
ameliorate the large gaps in the US HIV Care Continuum, particularly in Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE)
priority locations. In response, our highly experienced study team has developed and tested the Community
Health Workers And MHealth to ImProve Viral Suppression (CHAMPS) intervention which leverages mobile
health (mHealth) technology to create a multi-component intervention that targets multiple levels (individual,
social and sexual networks, and community) to improve ART adherence and VS. We propose to build on our
strong preliminary data of extant intervention work in PWH and directly respond to RFA-MD-23-007 by
leveraging our CHAMPS intervention which will be delivered by personnel from four HIV care settings in the
Deep South. The CHAMPS+ intervention is delivered via an mHealth platform to support PWH to self-manage
their ART regimens and adds to the extant CHAMPS intervention by adding a CHW-delivered supportive risk
reduction counseling (sexual behavior and substance use) during periods of non-suppression to prevent HIV
transmission. This proposed study also builds upon our mChoice (U01PS005229) and WiseApp
(R01HS025071) studies to improve ART adherence and VS in the Deep South. The proposed study design
has a three-fold purpose of: 1) engaging the target population in the development of culturally relevant
recruitment materials and retention strategies for the proposed study, 2) assessing the clinical effectiveness
and sustainability of the intervention in Deep South settings, and 3) evaluating regionalized implementation
factors guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework.
Ultimately, this study will test CHAMPS+ to promote ART adherence and suppressed viral load for PWH in in
Alabama, Louisiana (Orleans Parish), and Mississippi, US EHE prioritized jurisdictions. Importantly, our multi-
component intervention targets multiple levels to address HIV risk behaviors during periods of non-
suppression--an innovative and impactful component likely to be of great public health import."

The overall objective of this project is to apply mobile air sampling strategies and novel health assessment and
communication tools to rapidly characterize sustained health risks from hazardous volatile organic compound
(VOC) exposure during the remediation and recovery phases of the East Palestine, Ohio environmental disaster.
This research builds from ongoing mobile air sampling in East Palestine conducted as part of the Texas A&M
University Superfund Research Center (TAMU SRC) showing elevated VOC levels, particularly acrolein, that
vary spatially across the East Palestine township. The overall goal of the TAMU SRC is to characterize and
manage the human health risks associated with exposure to environmental emergency-mobilized hazardous
substances. The situation in East Palestine exemplifies the critical data gaps in both exposure and health risks.
Current ambient air monitoring approaches lack fine spatial resolution. Additionally, standard methods like those
used at EPA stationary monitors use “targeted” approaches, missing potential novel chemical exposures.
Importantly, there is also a lack of critical health information despite the documented environmental concerns
following the East Palestine train derailment, chemical spill, and controlled burn. Generally, there is very limited
data on the health impacts associated with these occurrences. Thus, the central hypothesis of this project is that
VOCs may vary spatially based on phases of the recovery, and mobile air sampling data in combination with
resident self-reported symptoms will inform localized hotspots of VOC mixtures. To determine the distribution of
VOCs over time as cleanup efforts continue, aim 1 will sustain mobile air monitoring by taking measurements
that are highly spatially and temporally resolved at 9-, 12-, and 15-months post-disaster. Aim 2 will focus on
interpreting VOC data, contextualizing risk, and collecting health data using validated surveys identifying
chemical and non-chemical stressors, addressing physical and mental health, and unique chemical sensitivities.
Also, the application of an innovative AI text messaging application for residents to freely report health and
environmental concerns through a chat bot will provide a means for continued health surveillance. Overall, the
novel tools and findings from this project will directly inform hyperlocal air quality and residential health concerns
following an environmental disaster that can serve as a template for responding to air pollution in disasters."
10817357,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this resubmitted, competitive renewal R01 application is to execute an unprecedented, com-
 prehensive, parallel and rigorous examination of the processing of each polyglutamine (polyQ) disease
 protein through a novel, isogenic series of transgenic animals and approaches that span Drosophila ge-
netics, physiology, mass spectrometry, mammalian cell biology and biochemistry. The polyQ family of proteins
is linked to nine incurable neurodegenerative maladies: Spinocerebellar Ataxias (SCAs) 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17,
Huntington's disease, Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and Kennedy's disease. While previous research
yielded impactful insights into individual polyQ diseases, we lack a “birds-eye view” of the disease collective,
which includes a concurrent analysis of the cellular processes key to the initiation and progression common to
each polyQ disorder. Here, we propose to uncover the role of shared and distinct pathways in polyQ protein
quality control. By the end of this proposed work, the field will have a comparative and mechanistic blueprint on
how each polyQ protein is controlled and degraded in vivo.
What we propose constitutes a rational and natural progression of the work that we conducted in prior cycles of
this R01 award (04/2014-02/2023; currently in NCE). Based on our extensive work, we propose the hypothesis
that polyQ diseases fall within distinct sub-categories of protein handling and toxicity, providing both a central-
ized understanding of polyQ disease biology as well as establishing shared points of neuroprotection among
these incurable disorders.
We recently generated an isogenic series of transgenic flies to model the family of polyQ diseases. Each line
contains the full-length human disease protein. Transgenes are integrated into a `safe harbor' site in the fly
genome, are in the same orientation and consist of a single inserted copy. Through targeted genetic screens
and hypothesis-based experimental design using this innovative series, we found overlapping components of
protein quality control and related factors that serve to regulate several polyQ disease proteins; we also ob-
served distinct regulatory processes that selectively affect some polyQ proteins, but not others.
Now, we seek to expand on our observations to decipher the underlying mechanisms across the entire spec-
trum of polyQ diseases by targeting key processes as well as focusing on individual cellular components. To
bring additional relevance and physiological significance to our studies in Drosophila, we will complement our
investigations with iNeuronal cultures differentiated into relevant cell populations. Assessments including fly
morphology, mobility, longevity, genetics, mass spectrometry, cell biology and biochemistry will provide action-
able information on the role of key cellular components involved in the degradation of polyQ proteins and their
toxicity in an intact, multicellular organism and in the mammalian cell environment."

This is a proposal to continue the Pediatric Critical Care Trauma Scientist Development Program (PCCTSDP)
as a national program to support research career development for young faculty in pediatric critical care and
pediatric trauma surgery. The goal of the PCCTSDP is to increase the number of highly trained, successfully
funded and sustainable physician scientists in pediatric critical care and trauma surgery, who will do research
to enhance the scientific understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical management of critical illness and
trauma, with emphasis on long-term consequences of critical illness and injury for children and families. In the
first nineteen years of the program, 61 PCCTSDP awardees (Scholars) have been appointed. Scholars have
received 37 K08 or K23 awards, and 39 R01- equivalent awards with many achieving other federal and
foundation funding. Scholars are selected by a National Advisory Committee (NAC) consisting of outstanding
pediatric and trauma surgeon scientists who are leaders in the field. Two to three new Scholars are appointed
annually. Applicants will identify an outstanding scientific mentor at their own institution, and will be sponsored
by their department chair. Each Scholar will spend 2 years in an intense research training environment in
basic, clinical or translational research, with a minimum of 75% protection from non-research responsibilities
(Phase I). In the subsequent 3 years (for a total of 5 years), Scholars must be financially supported by their
institutions to continue to have at least 50% - 75% protection to transition into independent investigators
(Phase II). Scholars are expected to apply for their own extramural funding in the form of a K or R level award
in the first 18 months of the K12 award. The PCCTSDP conducts an annual scientific retreat during which
Scholars will interact with the NAC members and NIH staff, present their scientific work, discuss their career
development plans and progress, and participate in selected workshops on faculty development, grant writing,
rigor and reproducibility and other relevant topics designed to enhance core competencies in research training.
Fellows and junior faculty who are underrepresented in medicine and those from IDeA States may apply to be
Diversity or IDeA Fellows at the retreat. By providing extended training and protected time to develop
outstanding skills in these young faculty, the PCCTSDP will continue to increase the pool of skilled
investigators in pediatric critical care and trauma."

The main focus of our scholarly work has been conducting laboratory-based research into
aging-relevant neurodegenerative diseases with a particular focus on neurodegenerative
diseases impacting Veterans’ health. We have established a group of interdisciplinary
researchers to identify genes and pathways involved in aging-related neurodegenerative
disease for the purpose of developing small-molecule neuroprotective agents for
neurodegenerative diseases impacting Veterans’ health. In particular our group
investigates the molecular targets for intervention against tau and TDP-43 neurotoxicity
in neurons. For this approach we employ a variety of model systems including transgenic
C. elegans, transgenic rodent, and human cellular models of protein aggregation. These
models are used to uncover genes playing a conserved role in neurotoxicity. We
anticipate that work in model systems may provide insight into mechanisms of
neurodegeneration in human disease. We can thus use these findings to formulate
hypotheses of neurotoxicity and develop neuroprotective strategies accordingly. Our
ultimate goal is to validate neuroprotective strategies using mammalian systems to de-
risk future development of therapeutic approaches for conditions impacting Veteran’s
health with a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease and ALS (a service connected

10808865,"Project Summary/Abstract
Our research plan's long-term objective is to reduce the disproportionate effects of prostate cancer on African
American men. In our published and yet to be published studies, we have found that increased levels of a
metabolite homocysteine were significantly associated with men with higher West African ancestry who have
elevated levels of the clinical prostate cancer marker prostate-specific antigen and who have been diagnosed
with prostate cancer. Our work further reveals significantly reduced levels of vitamin B6 and unique dietary
practices in African American men who are at high risk of developing prostate cancer. Also, we show a possible
role for elevated homocysteine in promoting metastasis (or spread) of the prostate tumors to the bone, which is
predominantly seen in African American patients.
Based on these findings, in this application, we propose determining the association between different dietary
practices and elevated levels of homocysteine and the likelihood of having prostate cancer in African American
men. In addition, we propose to determine the biological role of elevated homocysteine in promoting the growth
and development of African American prostate cancer. We will also evaluate the ability of combined levels of
three metabolites: homocysteine, methionine, and vitamin B6, in plasma, to detect prostate cancer early in
African American men.
This study's impact relies on understanding the role of diet and dietary patterns in contributing to prostate cancer
risk and the potential to develop healthy lifestyle interventions (e.g., dietary modification, vitamin B6
supplementation, etc.) to mitigate the risk of developing PCa in AA men. In the longer term, homocysteine and
vitamin B6 could be set as markers to screen AA men at higher risk of developing PCa."

environments like schools, restaurants, and workplaces. Much of daily life requires us to select behaviorally-
relevant auditory dimensions, and potentially suppress irrelevant dimensions, so that the information conveyed
can be remembered and responded to appropriately. Unfortunately, this vital everyday ability is affected by
many neurological conditions resulting in marked decreases in quality of life. Despite the importance of auditory
selective attention, its cognitive and neural mechanisms are poorly understood. For example, although auditory
selective attention is widely presumed to involve both a selective enhancement of behaviorally relevant auditory
dimensions and suppression of dimensions outside this attentional focus, evidence for suppression is scant. The
long-term goal of the proposed research is to arrive at a mechanistic understanding of auditory selective
attention. The present project pursues the central hypothesis that human auditory selective attention is a result
of processes related to both enhancement (of task-relevant sounds) and suppression (of task-irrelevant sounds).
Preliminary studies establish a nonspeech experimental paradigm for engaging - and improving –auditory
selective attention directed to specific frequency bands, and for non-invasively mapping it across auditory cortex
using multimodal MRI. A parallel preliminary study establishes that attention training drives improvements in
behavioral and electrophysiological measures of auditory selective attention. Aim 1 will determine the fine-
grained `listening window' through which auditory selective attention prioritizes and selects behaviorally
relevant auditory dimensions, and potentially suppresses irrelevant dimensions. These studies also will
determine the extent to which tasks and expectations created from input regularities shape the listening window.
Aim 2 will assess changes in the spectrotemporal shape of the auditory attentional filter as listeners learn to
more efficiently deploy auditory selective attention to specific dimensions. Aim 3 will identify the
neurobiological underpinnings of auditory selective attention and their changes across improvements in
selective attention. In all, the proposed research will weave together classic psychophysical approaches,
behavioral training as a means to introduce targeted demands on selective attention, and newly-developed
human neuroimaging tools to examine human auditory selective attention along the primary axis of auditory
representation – frequency. This will build a bridge from perceptuo-cognitive assays of human auditory selective
attention to mechanistic electrophysiological and cellular/molecular studies thus far only undertaken with
invasive nonhuman animal work, thereby compounding understanding and building a natural path toward
future evidence-based approaches to the remediation of auditory attention impairments."

Mapping the visual and visuomotor circuits of the brain using opsins and other actuators to target and control
neurons is a central goal of modern neuroscience. Actuators have become key to studying neuronal circuits,
modeling brain disorders, and developing new therapies. Neural actuator applications to research in rodents and
other small animals have achieved great success. In primates, however, these approaches have yet to be
transformative. The main problem is that viral vectors are required to deliver actuator genes, but both viral
transduction and gene expression have been unreliable across, and even within, primate labs. Efficacy is
hindered by the complex innate and adaptive retaliatory immune response in primates, and even when the
approach does work, cell-type specificity is lacking. The overall purpose of this project is to incorporate recent
advances in virology, gene therapy, and immunology to maximize viral transduction, maintain chronic gene
expression, and gain cell-type specificity through retrograde transportation of viruses in visual circuits of the
macaque brain. Throughout the project, optogenetics is the actuator-mediated intervention and the visual-
oculomotor system is the testbed. We focus on two viruses that provide retrograde transport: retrograde adeno-
associated virus-2 (rAAV2-retro) and fusion glycoprotein-E pseudotyped lentiviral vector (NeuRet). Each will
deliver genes encoding the Red-activatable Channelrhodopsin (ReaChR). Our team, spanning Duke, NYU, and
UNC-Chapel Hill, has extensive expertise in vector technology and macaque neurobiology. Aim 1 is dedicated
towards the maturation of pharmacological regimens that modify both arms of the primate's immune system to
enhance viral transduction and promote long-term constitutive expression of opsin transgenes. Aim 2 will
establish comprehensive expression maps of retrogradely transduced neurons. This mapping is a critical step
toward providing cell- and circuit-level specificity and supplies a means for physiologically identifying neurons,
through phototagging, based on their anatomical connectivity. Aim 3 will use phototagging paired with projection
targeting to identify and neurophysiologically characterize neurons contributing to specific circuits within the
visual and visuomotor circuitry of the macaque brain. In combination, this work will enhance the efficacy of viral
vectors for neuroscientific research of the macaque visual and visuomotor system, provide both anatomical and
functional validation of the developed protocols, and provide new insights into the functional role these specific
circuits serve in vision and visuomotor behaviors. Finally, this project will provide fundamental insights for
improving human gene therapies that depend on viral delivery of therapeutic genes."

Interactions between the hippocampus and mesolimbic dopamine system supports memory encoding and
subsequent consolidation to stabilize salient information in long-term memory. These episodic traces are used
to support a variety of adaptive behaviors, including inference, generalization, and decision-making.
Information seeking further represents a context in which motivated learning occurs in the absence of explicit
reward, including incubation-induced craving and context-dependent feedback. In this way, information seeking
may serve as a model to dissect how mesolimbic-hippocampal circuits contribute to the complexity of drug
seeking behavior. Most research characterizing the contributions of mesolimbic-hippocampal interactions on
memory have focused on reward. However, this circuit is also critically involved in memory enhancements
resulting from active exploration. Critically, memory enhancements during active information seeking involves
the integration of mesolimbic signaling across multiple elements of an event (cues versus outcomes) and
timescales (event-evoked versus state-dependent). Rodent studies show that hippocampal engagement during
exploration triggers a positive feedback loop, which increases tonic dopamine signaling in the ventral
tegmental area (VTA), which in turn yields larger VTA anticipation and feedback responses. Prominently, these
positive feedback loops could instantiate and propagate the variety of behaviors contributing to substance use.
We propose to characterize how state-dependent VTA responses relate to memory enhancements during
active information seeking using a combination of novel behavioral paradigms, state-of-the-art neuroimaging,
and computational modeling to inform mechanisms underlying memory. Aim 1 will study mesolimbic-
hippocampal contributes to memory encoding during active learning and hypothesis testing. Aim 2 will study
how engagement of this circuit during encoding stabilizes memory representations during periods of post-
encoding consolidation. Finally, Aim 3 will utilize a computational psychiatry approach to study how individual
differences in memory during active information seeking relates to predictors of substance use risk."

Quantitatively predicting drug-resistant mutations to improve precision oncology
My work builds towards a mechanistically informed approach to model and predict drug-resistant kinase
mutations that will enhance patient treatment regimens. Protein kinases are important signaling enzymes
often dysregulated in cancer; their pharmacological value as drug targets exemplified by the clinical use of over
75 FDA-approved inhibitors. Unfortunately, multiple clinically observed kinase mutant resist inhibitors and
drastically reduce patient survival rates. Precision oncology approaches, matching specific tumor profiles to
optimally therapies, have proven useful thanks to tumor sequencing and mutation profiling. However, it remains
challenging to identify drug-resistant mutants prior to treatment and develop regimens to circumvent them.
A lack of mechanistic information describing clinically observed kinase mutants makes it difficult to predict
whether a mutation will resist canonically used kinase inhibitors. Kinase mutations may decrease drug-binding
affinity, increase kinase activity, tune inhibitor sensitivity profiles, or any combination of these mechanisms.
Structure-based methods promise to help predict the impact of kinase mutations. I hypothesize that a kinase
inhibitor's utility against drug-resistant mutants is expressed using physical, quantitative properties like
structural state populations and binding affinities.
My work quantitatively assesses the impact of clinical kinase mutations on inhibitor resistance, sensitivity, and
susceptibility. Specifically, I will develop models that predict whether clinical kinase mutations perturb
inhibitor-binding, increase kinase activity by stabilizing active configurations, or sensitize kinases to
alternative inhibitors. In this proposal, I draw upon clinical mutation databases to study mutation-inhibitor pairs
of c-Met kinase, the target in Non-Small-Cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), building upon previous studies of
resistance mutations in Abl kinase. As a mentee (K99), I will use binding free-energy calculations to predict how
clinical mutations reduce c-Met inhibitor affinity (Aim 1). As I transition to independence (K99/R00), I will use
molecular simulations to biophysically evaluate whether clinical mutations increase kinase activity by shifting
kinase populations to catalytically active conformations (Aim 2). Upon independence (R00), I will study whether
clinical mutations sensitize kinases to rarely used alternative inhibitors (Aim 3). These computationally intensive
calculations can often take years to collect sufficient data on a normal computer. Instead, I will run calculations
on the planetary-scale Folding@home distributed computing platform in collaboration with high-throughput
biophysical experiments that measure kinase activity and inhibitor binding affinity. Overall, my proposal, and
future lab, will build towards a precision-oncology platform that helps clinicians plan treatment regimens."
10794823,"Vladimir Putin’s disastrous war on Ukraine has brought to international attention and ridicule the
hypermasculine imagery that is a staple of his public personae. This cartoonish machismo is not, however, an
advent of war’s necessity but a foundational aspect of Putin’s appeal. Putin’s manly ways resonate as they
counter the fears of weakness that have haunted Russians since the political and economic collapse of the
1990s when health funding fell, alcohol and tobacco use rose, and the average age of death for Russian men
plummeted. In 1994 it dropped to just 57.6 years, and the longevity gap, the differential between male and female
average life expectancy was a full 12.5 years by 1999. Russian men were weaker, sicker, and dying younger.
Between lower birth rates and dying men, experts predicted a dire decline for the Russian population – from 149
million in 1991 to an estimated 105 million by 2050. Russian pundits proclaimed it an existential crisis.
 Putin’s government has aggressively faced this crisis with pro-birth policies and broad restrictions on alcohol
and tobacco -- curtailing access, expanding warning labels, and limiting spaces for legal consumption – and
before COVID and the war, they claimed progress. In 2018 Putin declared the average age of death had been
pushed up to 73 “and predicted that by the end of the next decade it would rise to over 80. Leading the way was
Putin himself – physically fit, largely abstemious, and always manly. Putin’s posturing is not a joke within Russia.
For Putin to lose in Ukraine will not just be a blow to his manly-man image. Backing down is tied to national
health, recovery, existence, and the future. The war is woven through with worries over this existential crisis.
 Understanding Putin’s health programs and his personal appeal helps explain how his regime seemingly
solved, for a while at least, a problem faced by most industrialized countries -- the persistent longevity gap. For
example, despite extending life spans generally, American women live on average about five years longer than
men, and their health in those latter years is less plagued by illness. Just as in Russia, some of this differential
can be attributed to smoking and drinking by men, and consequent accidents, heart disease, cancer, and cardio-
vascular disease. But it is not just the USA and Russia. Governments worldwide have shown a commitment to
policies that promote harm reduction. None have claimed a turn-around as stunning as that of Putin’s Russia.
 Save the Men! Russian Male Health in Crisis from the Revolution to Today will provide public health
researchers and policy makers qualitative, historical research to make sense of the quantitative materials
emerging from Russia as well as the cultural resonance and popularity of Putin’s health campaigns. Save the
Men! will root these programs in anxieties over a century of demographic challenges. By outlining programs from
the Russian-Soviet-then-Russian state not to control women’s reproductive health but improve men’s behaviors
this project will provide a new view of Russian pronatalism as a mask for anxiety over male weakness."

This application is a competitive renewal of the NHLBI T35 training grant (Short-Term Training in Biomedical
Sciences) awarded to Indiana University School of Medicine (IUSM) in 2011 and 2016. This T35 greatly
contributed to the consolidation and expansion of the IUSM Student Program for Research and Scholarship
(IMPRS). The purpose of the IMPRS program is to provide a structured research environment that engages
medical students’ interest in biomedical research, creating opportunities for basic and translational research
experience and education in research ethics. The main objective of the T35 is to serve as a portal to train and
recruit physician-scientists. To meet the ongoing and increasing demand of IUSM medical students for
opportunities to engage in biomedical research and to expand program diversity, this application seeks support
to continue to enroll 32 highly motivated and diverse students/year within the IMPRS program to conduct
research in cardiovascular, respiratory and hematopoietic disease in basic and clinical departments and
centers at IUSM. This level of support is justified by sustained (and actually, growing) student participation,
increased trainee diversity, and excellent student outcomes. In parallel, we have significantly strengthened our
pool of mentors by recruiting an unprecedented pool of diverse and robustly NHLBI-funded researchers to
IUSM over the last five years, thus providing an innovative and diverse training environment in
cardiopulmonary, hematological and cancer research. Lastly, the program is now at an exciting inflection point,
where several of the first generation of T35 trainees are pursuing research in research-heavy fellowships or
are working in academic faculty positions, and bringing these alumni back to the program will provide a highly
valuable experience for the current trainees. This T35 training program serves as a central portal to recruit and
train students through active engagement in a diverse array of laboratory, translational and clinical research
and builds on the growing student participation and increasing mentor pool. With renewed T35 support, IMPRS
can maintain and improve medical student engagement in IUSM’s cutting-edge research programs. In
particular, the program is designed to a) increase student awareness of the value of engaging in biomedical
research by challenging students to take on independent projects during the internship; and b) support students
interested in careers in academic medicine. This occurs through 1) providing access to opportunities for
research presentation and publication, and 2) fostering engagement with degree programs such as the IUSM
MD/PhD program, the Clinical Investigation and Translational Education program, the Indiana Clinical and
Translational Sciences Institute medical student gap year for research program, or external research
fellowships. The long-term goal of the program is to increase the numbers and diversity of physician scientists
nationally by exposing students in their early years of medical education to hypothesis-driven research focused
on the molecular and cellular basis of disease and the potential for clinical translation."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a heterogeneous condition resulting from the interplay of neurobiological,
genetic, and environmental factors. There is pressing need to develop new and, potentially, broadly effective
medications. Alcohol is a highly pro-inflammatory molecule, which is key in the pathogenesis of alcohol-
induced tissue damage. Work by the applicants and collaborators has identified 3 candidate drugs for
repositioning for AUD that are likely to act at least in part via reduction of neuroinflammation. They include
inhibitors of the pannexin1 channel, which has emerged as a major driver of neuroinflammation, and
modulators of glucocorticoid signaling, that has a complex action on inflammation. In fact, chronic
glucocorticoids result in neuroinflammation and neuronal damage that contribute to both AUD and
neurodegenerative diseases. Collectively, these considerations support targeting inflammation and the
associated tissue damage for AUD. However, some inflammatory signaling mechanisms recruited by alcohol,
such as the Toll-like receptor 4, have proven not to modify alcohol intake. Thus, it is paramount to delineate the
inflammatory mechanisms of motivational and therapeutic significance. To this end, Specific Aim 1 in the
present proposal will test the effects of representative anti-inflammatory drugs including direct and indirect
inflammasome inhibitors with different mechanisms of action in an established rat paradigm of non-dependent
and dependent alcohol intake, which is characterized by escalated alcohol drinking and is highly translational
as it proved sensitive to the action of virtually all drugs that have shown promise in human AUD. Interlinked
studies in Specific Aim 2 will dissect the effects of alcohol and the therapeutics under study on
neuroinflammation, inflammasome regulation and astrocyte and microglia regulation to identify key indicators
of alcohol-induced neuroinflammation as well as the mechanisms of action of the drugs under testing to
determine the molecular bases of their effectiveness or lack thereof as well as to uncover potential new
therapeutic targets for AUD.
 Altogether, the results of this study will advance our understanding of the mechanisms behind treatment
responsiveness or lack thereof as well as of alcohol-induced tissue damage of therapeutic significance, and
will point to new therapeutic targets for more specific and effective medications to ameliorate
neuroinflammation and tissue damage in the setting of AUD and reduce excessive alcohol consumption."
11121651,"Worldwide approximately 232 million or 50% of people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are undiagnosed. Furthermore, 81% with prediabetes (PreD), more than 77 million in the United States, are undiagnosed. This disproportionately affects the underserved, underrepresented, and lower socioeconomic communities, which account for 79% with T2D. Earlier identification could halt or delay disease progression, decreasing irreversible complications, and helping reduce the associated $966 billion global expenditure. Our prior publications demonstrated that increased deltoid muscle echo intensity (MEI) on ultrasound (US) was accurate for the incidental detection of T2D and PreD, independent of the patient’s age and duration of disease (including those recently diagnosed with T2D/PreD). This increased skeletal MEI was also more pronounced when compared to subjects with obesity but without T2D/PreD. Furthermore, it was observed in undiagnosed/incident T2D and PreD by ADA criteria, and in some patients it appeared to predate abnormal HbA1c elevations. Additionally, our exciting preliminary findings demonstrated that this increased skeletal MEI corresponded with varying degrees of skeletal muscle insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction—including fibrosis, myosteatosis, and reduced contractile force. The potential to noninvasively detect developing skeletal muscle insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction, before the onset of glucose dysregulation, as a harbinger of T2D, is a metabolic circumstance that does not exist. The overall objective of this project is to test the hypothesis that increased MEI can be used to accurately detect developing skeletal muscle insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction. We propose to accomplish this in two specific aims. First, by performing prospective USs of upper and lower extremity skeletal muscles in two cohorts with MEI quantifications and obtaining concurrent labs (Aim 1), we can define the relationship between MEI and clinical markers of diabetes and insulin resistance. Also, for the first time, biopsies will be taken directly from this increased skeletal MEI (Aim 2) to elucidate this novel early T2D-related US muscle abnormality and its association with muscle dysfunction. We hypothesize that by performing prospective US, labs, and muscle biopsies, we will clarify the associations and impact of this muscle finding for structural, functional, and histopathologic alterations (Aims 1 and 2). This proposed project has the potential to clarify the cause and significance of this muscle abnormality which could represent earlier detection of developing muscle insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction, prior to clinically apparent metabolic dysfunction. An easy, noninvasive, inexpensive, and nonionizing imaging method to detect developing skeletal muscle insulin resistance and muscle dysfunction, as a harbinger of T2D, would have tremendous clinical impact by allowing earlier interventions and more aggressive treatments for metabolic and muscle dysfunction, prior to these complications accelerating. Furthermore, expanding our understanding about factors in skeletal muscle that underlie elevated MEI can help optimize treatments to prevent or treat this abnormality."
10793132,"Cancer immunotherapy using checkpoint blockade (CPB) has revolutionized cancer treatment,
providing durable cures with acceptable toxicity in some cancer patients. However, only a few
cancer types respond and even in responding tumor types, response is often limited to a minority
of these cancers, which raises the question whether directly targeting T cells is sufficient and
whether other aspects of immunity can be exploited to stimulate or boost antitumor immunity.
Inflammatory, or immunogenic, cell death is emerging to be an important immune node that
bridges innate and adaptive immunity to stimulate antitumor immunity as well as to potentiate
CPB. While antineoplastic agents currently used in humans can also sometimes induce
inflammatory cell death to help re-establish immune surveillance in the tumor microenvironment,
these agents do not predictably induce immunogenic cell death, thus leading to variable outcomes.
 The hypothesis we propose in this project can fundamentally change this scenario by
inducing predictable immunogenic cell death through targeting key molecules known as
gasdermins (GSDMs) in particular GSDMD, which are widely expressed in cancers and can
directly induce immunogenic cell death upon activation. GSDMD mediates pyroptosis and
cytokine release downstream of inflammasomes, which are supramolecular complexes that
activate inflammatory caspases (caspase-1/-4/-5 in humans, caspase-1/-11 in mice). Activated
caspase-1 processes IL-1 family cytokines to their active forms and all inflammatory caspases
cleave GSDMD to produce an N-terminal (NT) fragment that forms pores in the cell membrane to
induce pyroptosis, and to release IL-1 family cytokines and other inflammatory mediators,
including ATP and HMGB1.
 We specifically propose to identify small molecule agonists of GSDMD for direct induction
of immunogenic pyroptosis in cancer cells, which may also synergize with other immune
modulators as well as with CPB. GSDMD is widely expressed in cancers. While GSDMD is also
expressed in some normal tissues, the need for only a small fraction of tumor cells to undergo
pyroptosis to alert the immune system may make GSDMD agonism non-toxic even when
administered systemically."

 Copper ions are an essential nutrient for living organisms and are widely used in enzyme-catalyzed redox
reactions. However, high levels of copper ions are toxic to cells, including microbial pathogens. Healthcare
facilities use copper in touched surfaces to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, and mammalian immune
systems can harness the toxicity of copper ions to kill pathogenic bacteria in macrophages. Nevertheless,
pathogenic bacteria can resist being killed by copper ions. Therefore, this proposal seeks to understand
structure-function relationships for a novel copper ion resistance protein in enterobacteria, a family of
Gram-negative bacteria that includes major etiological agents of food-borne illness and hospital-acquired
infections worldwide. Our preliminary studies have shown that the lipoprotein DcrB confers resistance to high
Cu2+ in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, a bacterial cause of food-borne illness in humans. The
DcrB protein is highly conserved in enterobacteria. We have determined the first three-dimensional structure
of a DcrB protein, which revealed it contains the Mog1p/PsbP-like fold, a widespread fold found in proteins that
participate in a range of cellular functions. We have identified structural features that are important for the
function of DcrB in copper resistance.
 This proposal seeks to understand how these features of DcrB are essential for its function. Aim 1 focuses
on determining how two clusters of residues form an essential functional combination. Aim 2 focuses on
investigating how the N-terminal beta-hairpin is essential for the function of DcrB. For both aims, we will use
site-directed mutagenesis, genetic, and physiological experiments to probe the structural and biochemical
properties for each feature. We will use X-ray crystallography to determine how changes to these features
impact the structure of DcrB, and we will use biophysical experiments to investigate the influence of these
features on the thermodynamics of folding of DcrB.
 The proposed research will engage undergraduate students at a primarily undergraduate institution in
hands-on biomedical research that will reveal how a novel family of membrane-anchored proteins contributes
to copper ion resistance in a medically relevant bacterial species. Results will be applicable to various human
pathogens that cause bacterial food-borne illness, plague, and healthcare-associated infections. Knowledge
gained from this research will lead to the development of strategies to target bacterial resistance to metal ions
and enhance the effective use of copper as an antimicrobial surface. Broadly, this proposal will 1) provide
insight into the fundamental biological question of how cells control levels of a toxic metal ion; 2) advance
structure-function knowledge for a widespread protein fold; 3) impact human health research by studying this
question in bacteria that threaten public health worldwide; and 4) impact scientific education by stimulating
undergraduate research."

Head and neck cancer squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are the seventh most common cancers globally
and are associated with poor survival rates. Pharmacological treatments for HNSCC remain largely ineffective
and improving therapies requires the identification of novel factors that modulate not just the tumor but also the
surrounding permissive oral microenvironment. Aging is a variable tightly associated with HNSCC development
and is linked to tissue alterations and defective immune responses. However, while older chronological age is
associated with tumor development and elderly HNSCC patients exhibit worse five-year survival, very little is
known about the molecular mechanisms by which aging contributes to the etiology of HNSCC. The goal of this
proposal is to define signals associated with HNSCC progression in aged tissues with the hope to uncover
targetable mechanisms that may offer new therapeutic avenues. To test the influence of age on HNSCC, we
optimized syngeneic orthotopic tongue xenograft models of HNSCC and have observed more rapid tumor
growth in old animals, with tumors exhibiting an age-associated, immune evasive and transcriptionally-distinct
tumor cell states. We have found that these age-associated alterations correlate with increased extracellular
matrix levels that we hypothesize the mechanical properties of old tissues direct distinct mechanosensitive
signals. Our observations suggest that the mechanical-effector YAP, a transcriptional regulator mediating
Hippo pathway signaling that has pro-tumorigenic functions in HNSCC, is linked to age-associated
tumorigenesis. We propose to examine the relationship between aging, extracellular matrix dynamics, YAP
activity and YAP-directed functions, including immune evasion. We further plan to compare matrix dynamics
and tissue elasticity across mice of different chronological age and test how increasing collagen levels or
reducing collagen crosslinking affects tumorigenic behavior. We will further test the consequences of inhibiting
YAP activity in age-associated tumors, profiling accompanying transcriptional and cellular changes. Finally, we
will test how reintroducing an absent chemokine program regulated by YAP that is repressed in the old tongue
microenvironment impacts tumor growth and tumor lymphocyte infiltration. Data collected from our study will
provide a comprehensive assessment of age-associated mechanical signals and offer new insight into
mechanisms that may direct the heterogenous lymphocytic functions observed in HNSCC."

Wildfires are a threat to public health worldwide, growing in both intensity and prevalence year-by-year,
particularly in regions at the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). The health impacts associated with exposures to
wildfire smoke include those relevant to the pulmonary system, including asthma, bronchitis, dyspnea, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and respiratory infections; however, the impacts and quantified health risks at
the WUI remain understudied. This research gap likely exists due to the inherent difficulties surrounding the
evaluation of these complex and variable atmospheric exposures. The team brought together by the PI has
established methods and recent data measuring harmful chemicals in simulated wildfire scenarios, including
conditions that incorporate anthropogenic materials indicative of the WUI environment. We have also
demonstrated through vigorous pilot experimentation that different wildfire smoke conditions converge upon
biological changes in the lung relevant to lung cell stress and hypoxia. Recent molecular-based experimentation
has also uncovered novel mediation of pulmonary toxicity through extracellular vesicle mechanisms coinciding
with incidences of cell stress and hypoxia. This study set out to test the innovative hypothesis that forest and
WUI burn scenarios will initiate MOAs with shared components across in vitro, in vivo animal, and human
systems, facilitating health risk predictions in humans for exposure conditions that need health guidances. We
will address this hypothesis through aims designed to carry out the following: First, we will use in vitro lung
models derived from human donors to evaluate biological responses across multiple forest and WUI-relevant
exposures, including conditions that are difficult to evaluate in vivo, particularly in humans due to feasibility
limitations and ethical considerations. Second, we will evaluate in vivo responses to select burn scenarios in
mice and humans, with analyses focusing on the prototypical burn scenario of smoldering red oak, without WUI-
relevant materials in humans and +/- WUI-relevant materials in mice. Biological responses that will be
characterized across systems include lung cell transcriptional and protein-level responses relevant to cell stress
and hypoxia, emphasizing hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A) and connected pathways. Functional
responses will include changes in lung function in vivo and markers of tissue injury/stress/inflammation.
Pulmonary secreted signals that are known to coincide with cell stress and hypoxia include extracellular vesicles,
which will also be evaluated for changes in physical characteristics, count, and molecular cargo. All aims
incorporate advanced computational toxicology approaches, paralleling strengths of the PI, and pave the way
for health risk estimates across a wide domain of wildfire exposures. This cross-cutting approach aligns with
many NIEHS goals and will serve as a solid foundation for the PI’s laboratory, to support future research efforts
aimed at improving environmental and public health."

lymphoid tissues in HIV infected individuals and pose obstacles for HIV cure. Clues may lie in the early
pathogenic effects of HIV infection in the secondary lymphoid tissues including gut lymphoid tissue and disruption
of their structure and function. Novel combination approaches are needed for targeting eradication of virally
infected cells. The overall objective of this proposed R01 application is to investigate the potential of
mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) in enhancing mucosal anti-viral immunity and to determine efficacy of
viral suppression in combination with ART as well as the viral clearance in combination with eCD4-Ig, an HIV
and SIV inhibitor. We propose to utilize SIV infected non-human primate model of AIDS to investigate potential
therapeutic benefits of MSCs in combination with eCD4-Ig or ART for effective clearance of virally infected cells.
MSCs are adult stem cells that are anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory and are investigated as
therapeutics. Our preliminary results of MSC administration in SIV infected rhesus macaque model of AIDS
showed redistribution of SIV infected cells to lymphoid follicles and enhanced anti-viral immunity. This opens a
new opportunity to corral and target the virus by using a combination of MSC and a novel potent viral inhibitor,
eCD4-Ig and reduce the viral pool from GALT. We will test the hypothesis that systemic MSC administration will
modulate antigen presentation and enhance anti-viral immunity at mucosal sites in SIV infected rhesus macaque
model of AIDS and lead to better viral suppression and increased immune recovery. This proposal leverages
on our unique strengths in MSC biology, SIV model of AIDS, mucosal immunology and novel eCD4-Ig inhibitor.
The overall objective of this R01 proposal is to investigate the effects of MSC administration on anti-viral mucosal
immunity and viral clearance in gut lymphoid tissue of SIV infected rhesus macaques.
Aim 1: To determine the effect of MSC administration on anti-viral mucosal immunity and viral clearance in gut
lymphoid tissue of SIV infected rhesus macaques. MSC will be injected into chronically SIV infected animals and
its effect on anti-viral mucosal immunity and viral clearance in gut lymphoid tissue and peripheral blood will be
examined. Efficacy of AAV-expressed eCD4-Ig in combination with MSC administration will be examined for
eradicating virus-positive cells and viral loads. Aim 2: To determine the effect of MSC administration on effective
viral suppression in gut lymphoid tissue during ART as well as after ART interruption. SIV infected macaques on
ART will receive MSC during ART and after ART interruption and virologic, immunologic and molecular analyses
will be performed. The proposed study will provide an innovative approach of using MSC to enhance anti-viral
immunity, resolve virus-associated mucosal damage and induce effective viral suppression and clearance."

White Mountain Apache (WMA) leaders have voiced an urgent need to prioritize breast cancer screening
research in NARCH XI due to concern about low screening rates. As of 2018, screening rates among
eligible WMA women were more than 2 times lower than the Healthy People 2020 target, 39.1%
compared to 81.1%, and substantially lower than screening rates among AI/AN women nationally. In
Arizona (AZ), where the WMA tribal lands are located, 32% of AI women are diagnosed at later stage
disease (i.e., either regional or distant vs. local disease) compared to 25% of AZ women overall. There is
a great need for culturally appropriate interventions to improve screening rates and reduce mortality and
morbidity from breast cancer in the WMAT population.
This project will support the WMA-JHU partners and our established cancer care Community Advisory
Board to design two motivational tools based on findings regarding barriers and facilitators to breast
screening among Apache women, and he shortage of providers’ time and resources to provide clinic-
based education. The first tool will be delivered on a tablet in the clinic with highly graphic, culturally
congruent breast-cancer screening information. It is named Tablet-based Education to improve
Acceptance of Mammography” or “TEAM.” The second tool will be an Individual-based one-to-one
peer-educational module delivered by a paraprofessional Apache women’s health coach, called
“COACH,” to address individuals’ personal barriers and facilitators to breast cancer and screening
concerns and provide one-to-one support for scheduling, transportation and completing a mammogram.
We will evaluate these intervention tools through an RCT with n= 500 women aged 50+ who receive a
mammography referral after a local outpatient visit. Women will be stratified by prior history of
mammography (never or ever) and age (<65 or 65+), and then randomized 1:1 to receive either TEAM
alone or TEAM+Coach. The WMA-JHU partners bring extensive experience building and evaluating
motivational behavior change curricula delivered one-on-one and with mobile health tools that have now
been scaled to >140 tribal communities across 21 states."

(i) Manage the administrative and compliance activities; (ii) Control and supervise the overall
budget, maintaining an updated record of all expenses and make budget projections; (iii)
Coordinate and facilitate the communication among Projects and Cores and maintain shared
server site and databases with access to Program members; (iv) Provide secretarial and
administration support for delivering reports; (v) Provide administrative assistance related to
animal use protocol creation, submission to the Animal Research Committee, and adherence to
necessary standards of procedure; (vi) Coordinate the dissemination of findings within and
outside of the Program; (vii) Establish and support the External Scientific Advisory Committee;
(viii) Call and organize annual meetings of all participants of the Program Project and with the
External Scientific Advisory Committee.
In all these activities, the Administrative Core will function with integrity to serve all Projects and
Cores within the Program."
10798274,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our broad, long-term objectives are to supply reagents, models and expertise from a
centralized Science Core facility to all participants of the Program Project. Core operation
represents a balance between providing services based on established procedures, and
continued innovation in methods and protocols. Safety is a particular guiding principle of
the Core, and is addressed by the many years of experience of Core participants in the
study of prion diseases, facilities for safe homogenization and other biohazard operating
procedures, prion handling and decontamination. Protocol standardization is another
crucial goal, so that all aspects of the Program Project have access to reagents and
services produced and operated using consistent methods from a constant, reliable
source. The Science Core proposes five Specific Aims to accomplish this goal: Aim I will
produce and supply characterized mouse models of prion disease and tissues from those
mice; Aim II will supply purified anti-PrP monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with well-defined
properties; Aim III will supply preparations of purified infectious prions; Aim IV will quantify
prions using sensitive, high throughput cell-based assays; and Aim V will perform detailed
biochemical, biophysical and structural studies of prion strains. The Science Core has
shown itself to be capable of adapting to efficiently incorporate elements of previous Core
structures as well as providing expanded state of the art facilities, techniques and skills
for the entire Program Project. The longstanding experience of the Core Co-Directors, Dr.
Telling and Dr. Soto, and Associate Director Dr. Bian, is a significant strength. The Science
Core resides in outstanding environments for studies of prion diseases. Studies within
individual Projects will be conducted in close collaboration with the Science Core to take
advantage of the availability of models and expertise, standardized and consistent
methodologies, and uniformly consistent, high quality reagents. The activity of the Science
Core is essential for the successful accomplishment of Program goals."
10798276,"Our broad, long-term objectives are to are to decipher the mechanisms by which infectious
prions replicate, encode strain information, and evolve to acquire new properties. We
propose four Specific Aims to address our central hypothesis that incompletely adapted
prion strains are comprised of poorly optimized ensembles of PrPSc quasi species
conformers that evolve under selective pressure towards states of enhanced stability and
pathogenicity. Our particular focus is chronic wasting disease (CWD), an uncontrollable
contagious epidemic of cervids of uncertain zoonotic potential. Using genetically
engineered CWD-susceptible mice, cultured cells, cell free amplification, and antibodies
recognizing defined conformation-dependent PrP epitopes, Aim I will address the
mechanism of adaptation of unstable emergent CWD prions in response to physical and
chemical constraints. In Aim II we will address the hypothesis that that residue 226 and
other cervid PrP polymorphisms influence selection of distinct portfolios of CWD strain
conformers with different adaptive potentials. Using gene targeted mice expressing
physiologically controlled levels of PrP variants and in vitro systems for prion replication,
we will characterize the properties of strains propagated in these backgrounds and explore
whether interference between them affects selection and adaptation of CWD. In Aim III,
we will assess the properties of emergent Norwegian moose and reindeer CWD strains
experimentally propagated in deer and compare with established North American CWD.
Aim IV will address an unmet need in the field of significant importance, namely the paucity
of model systems and tools for studying human prions. Using newly generated gene
targeted mice expressing physiological levels of human PrP and novel approaches to
derive susceptible human neuroblastoma cells, we will assess the zoonotic potential of
emergent CWD strains and their adapted derivatives propagated in different cervid PrP
backgrounds. Our ultimate goal is to assess and manage the risk posed to humans from
continually evolving prions, specifically those causing CWD, by understanding the means
by which they propagate and exist as heritable strains with protean host range properties
that adapt and evolve under selective pressure."
10798279,"ABSTRACT
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) affecting various species of cervids in North American and
Northern Europe represents a serious problem, because it continues to propagate uncontrollably
among wild and captive cervids. CWD appears to be very heterogeneous with multiple different
strains and can be transmitted to other animal species. The risk of CWD transmission to humans
is unknown which is a major concern because the number of sick animals and their geographical
distribution is rapidly increasing. The mechanism by which CWD propagates so efficiently among
cervids is also unknown.
The main goal of this project is to utilize a set of highly innovative techniques to study the cellular,
molecular and structural features of naturally occurring CWD strains and their potential for inter-
species transmission, particularly focusing on the possibility that certain CWD strains may infect
humans. We will also attempt to elucidate the atomic resolution structure of CWD prions using
cryo-electron microscopy. The overarching hypothesis is that CWD exists as multiple strains in
distinct individuals and even within the same individual in different brain cells and that inter-
species transmission and zoonotic potential depend on the specific strain characteristics. The
project is divided in the following specific aims: (1) Study the structural and molecular diversity of
natural CWD strains and the high resolution three-dimensional structure of CWD prions. (2)
Understand CWD prion strain diversity in single brain cells isolated by laser capture
microdissection and subsequently amplified by PMCA. (3) Evaluate CWD inter-species
transmission spillover potential and its effect on zoonotic potential. (4) Analyze the deer-human
prion species barrier in vivo using chimeric mice harboring human and cervid neuronal cells.
The studies included in this projects will address some of the most pressing questions regarding
CWD, including (i) the CWD prion strain variability, (ii) the zoonotic potential of different CWD
prion strains, (iii) the atomic resolution structure of infectious prions and the structural basis of
prion strains, (iv) the cellular distribution of CWD prion strains in the brain and its gene expression
consequences, (v) the spillover potential of CWD to other animal species, (vi) the potential role of
intermediate species in the transmission of CWD prions to humans.
The findings generated in this project will be essential to design measures to prevent further
propagation of CWD, and to avoid the emergence of new diseases with potentially disastrous
consequences."
10806479,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are a novel class of medications that reduce CVD events,
particularly heart failure (HF) outcomes in patients with HF and reduced or normal left ventricular (LV) function.
The mechanism for the effect of SGLT2i is not well understood, but they may beneficially alter LV structure and
function through changes in plasma proteins. Atrial myopathy is a novel biomarker for increased cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk. Atrial myopathy is characterized by abnormalities in the structure, function, and electrical
conduction of the left atrium (LA). LA function can be quantified using strain analysis with 2-dimensional
echocardiography (2DE) allowing detection of LA dysfunction before overt structural changes and LA
enlargement occur. LA dysfunction is associated with increased risk for atrial fibrillation, stroke, dementia, and
heart failure. Despite this risk, there are no proven therapies to treat or prevent LA dysfunction. Untargeted
proteomic analyses done in adults with LA dysfunction are suggestive of an association with plasma proteins
involved in cardiomyocyte function and inflammatory pathways. The goal of this K23 Career Development
Award is to conduct a 9-month double-blind placebo-controlled RCT of empagliflozin (an SGLT2i) in 80
individuals at risk for HF but no diagnosis of HF or diabetes. Individuals will be identified by screening patients
who visit the Cardiology clinic at the University of Minnesota. The primary endpoints for the proposed RCT
include changes in LA and LV function assessed by 2DE at baseline and 9 months; and change in 8 a priori
identified plasma proteins. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that change in LA function from baseline to 9 months
will be more favorable in the empagliflozin group than placebo. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that change in LV
diastolic from baseline to 9 months will be more favorable in the empagliflozin group than placebo. Aim 3 will
test the hypothesis that compared with placebo, empagliflozin will be associated with greater change in the
selected proteins after 9 months. The proposed training and mentoring plan has the following goals: 1) acquire
expertise in clinical trial design, implementation, and analysis; 2) develop expert knowledge in left atrial
myopathy; 3) acquire necessary skills to design, execute, and interpret studies involving proteomic analysis; 4)
develop enhanced collaborative skills, written and oral communication skills, and management skills necessary
to lead a multidisciplinary team. The training plan includes attendance at educational seminars and scientific
meetings, structured mentoring, formal coursework, and hands on experience on this mentored K23 project
and other collaborative research with mentors. In summary, the requested K23 support will provide the training
and mentoring necessary for the candidate to establish himself as a successful independent physician scientist
in the field of preventive cardiology. The proposed research will also provide novel preliminary evidence
regarding the effect of empagliflozin on LA and LV function in an understudied population, informing a future
R01-funded RCT evaluating SGLT2i treatment effect on CVD outcomes in patients without diabetes or HF."
10806588,"Contextually responsive implementation of place-activation interventions for promoting physical
activity in marginalized urban peripheries in Mexico
PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Mexico is an upper-middle income country with high levels of poverty, inequities, urbanization
(79%), and NCD burden (77% of all deaths), including a major diabetes and obesity crisis. Given this public
health emergency, multiple bold, large-scale evidence-based interventions (EBIs) to improve healthy eating
have been implemented. However, commensurate action for physical activity promotion, another critical
determinant of obesity, diabetes, and multiple other NCDs, remains lacking. Within the context of Mexican
cities, people living in marginalized urban peripheries (low-income neighborhoods on the outskirts of
metropolitan areas) comprise a high-need population with multiple challenges, including limited access to
spaces and programs for leisure-time physical activity. Place-activation interventions are research-proven
strategies (i.e., EBIs) for increasing physical activity in urban settings, by optimizing the use of new or
rehabilitated public open places through community-engaged, multisectoral approaches.
Goal: This proposal seeks to reduce the burden of physical inactivity in Mexico through an urban equity
approach, by increasing the uptake of place-activation EBIs in marginalized urban peripheries.
Methods: We will conduct a mixed-methods study in up to 10 major metropolitan areas of Mexico where our
team has existing partnerships. Our study will test multisectoral engagement methods to advance active
dissemination and implementation (D&I) for increasing the uptake of place-activation EBIs in marginalized
urban peripheries. We will pursue three specific aims: (1) use a mixed methods approach to adapt place-
activation EBIs for use in our study settings (surveys, interviews, and focus groups); (2) conduct a hybrid III
group-randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of active D&I methods for improving the reach,
adoption and implementation of place-based EBIs (15 intervention neighborhoods with recent public open
space improvements will receive an active D&I strategy, and 15 comparison neighborhoods with recent public
open space improvements will serve as controls); and, (3) use a community-engaged, participatory approach
to examine the potential for longer-term maintenance and scalability of place-activation EBIs (GIS interviews,
co-creation workshops, concept mapping). Our work will be guided by the “necessity- vs. choice-based
physical activity models” framework for contextually-responsive physical activity promotion in LMICs; and the
adapted version of the RE-AIM D&I framework for scaling up physical activity interventions globally.
Innovations and Impact: This study is innovative and impactful as it will be the first to test state-of-the-
science, active D&I methods for improving the uptake of effective, place-based physical activity EBIs in a high-
need, hard to reach, and underserved population. As such, it will provide critical evidence for addressing the
growing burden of physical inactivity and NCD inequities in Mexico. Further, it will help build urgently needed
capacity for D&I science and physical activity research in Mexico."

This K24 renewal proposes salary and research support for Lucas Hoffman, MD, PhD to continue to spend at
least 25% of his time mentoring students, fellows, and junior faculty in patient-oriented research (POR) on the
microbial determinants of chronic, pediatric diseases. This proposal will enable Dr. Hoffman to continue his
productive translational research program that has already provided a successful training framework for MD
and PhD trainees in the principles and conduct of POR. This proposal describes existing translational research
projects in the Hoffman laboratory that will provide training opportunities to current and future mentees, as well
as new projects likely to emerge from this ongoing work. The proposal also provides time and infrastructure
support to help Dr. Hoffman enhance his mentoring skills, including classwork and new opportunities to interact
with trainees, and an advisory committee of experienced, senior national experts in POR. Both of the featured,
ongoing research projects provide opportunities for face-to-face interactions and leverage existing resources to
investigate novel questions and yield new resources, providing optimal opportunities for trainees:
Project 1 investigates the effects of a powerful new treatment on the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiomes and
metabolomes of people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). This project leverages the samples and
linked biomarker and clinical data from two parallel, ongoing national observational studies of subjects with CF
before and after initiating treatment with highly-effective CFTR modulator therapy, which restores the activity of
the protein that is defective in people with CF, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR). The analysis we are performing builds on the results of a study described in my first K24 proposal that
ultimately identified a significant fecal dysbiosis in people with CF that correlated with impaired nutrition and
with abnormal fecal metabolite content, including that of bile acids. For this study, the Hoffman laboratory is
analyzing the fecal samples of enrolled subjects to test the hypothesis that CFTR modulator therapy will
change the fecal microbiomes and metabolomes of PwCF in parallel with clinical improvement.
Project 2 similarly builds on a project described in my first K24 proposal focused on the respiratory
microbiomes of people with CF that defined the respiratory tract microbiomes of people with CF during inhaled
antibiotic therapy. Using the respiratory samples and data being collected by the studies described in Project 1,
this study will test the hypothesis that CFTR modulator therapy will change both upper and lower respiratory
tract microbiomes of people with CF in parallel with each other and with clinical improvement.
Both projects provide opportunities to interact with study subjects and to develop laboratory, computational,
and analytical skills for current and future early-career clinician-scientist mentees, representing ideal training
vehicles in POR. This proposal also describes other ongoing projects in the Hoffman lab that provide similarly
exceptional opportunities for mentees at various stages of their academic development."
10806592,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a complex, debilitating disease with
inconclusive causes and no laboratory-based diagnostic tests. Oxygen tension (PO2)-regulated red blood cell
(RBC) capillary velocity has emerged recently as a new mechanism regulating cerebral capillary perfusion and
measures RBC responses to local hypoxia. Such intrinsic RBC responses to PO2 changes may change distinctly
under different pathological conditions and thus represent a new RBC-based approach for disease diagnosis.
Indeed, our preliminary results showed that RBCs collected from ME/CFS patients exhibited impaired velocity in
a microfluidic capillary in response to reduced PO2 and PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity was improved
significantly when patients received craniocervical instability surgery, strongly suggesting that PO2-regualted
RBC capillary velocity may represent a new characteristic of ME/CFS that might be used to diagnose ME/CFS
and measure ME/CFS progression. Here, we extend our preliminary study and propose an interdisciplinary
approach combing microfluidics, machine learning and RBC cytokine assay to examine rigorously the accuracy
of PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity as a new laboratory test for ME/CFS and investigate mechanistically the
roles of RBC cytokine signaling in ME/CFS.
Aim 1 will measure PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity using RBCs from 96 participants and compare the
results of ME/CFS patients with age, gender and race-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, we will develop
machine-learning algorithms to establish a diagnostic classifier to validate PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity
as a new laboratory test for ME/CFS and assess its feasibility to differentiate ME/CFS patients with different
disease severity. Mechanistically, we will examine hemoglobin-band 3 interactions in RBCs from ME/CFS
patients and examine their correlations with increased oxidative stress in ME/CFS.
Aim 2 will quantify the cytokine profile in RBCs from ME/CFS patients and compare them with age, gender and
race-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, we will alter the RBC cytokine profile and measure the
corresponding changes of PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity to examine whether RBC cytokine profile plays
a role in the modulation of PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity. These experiments will provide a previously
unrecognized RBC cytokine signaling in ME/CFS and add new insights to the immune dysregulation in ME/CFS.
Together, the proposed studies exploit new tools and technology to develop a new laboratory test for ME/CFS
and reveal mechanistims underlying PO2-regulated RBC capillary velocity in ME/CFS, which we believe will
directly improve the diagnosis and treatment of ME/CFS."
10796422,"Congenital heart diseases (CHD) refer to abnormalities present in the heart and the great vessels at birth.
CHD is the most commonly diagnosed birth defect and the leading cause of birth-related mortality. These
abnormalities can be a single defect or a combination of multiple defects that can alter the blood flow to and/or
from the heart to the body. CHD affects approximately 40,000 newborns annually in the US and 1.35 million
globally. The prevalence of CHD in the US population has been estimated to be close to 2.9 million patients,
which represents about 25% of the total number of CHD cases worldwide. Among patients with CHD, around
22% of the total critical CHDs are affected by anomalies that impact the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT),
such as tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), pulmonary atresia, truncus arteriosus, and transposition of the great vessels.
Replacement valves and conduits are needed to replace structures that are congenitally absent or hypoplastic
in these conditions and restore normal blood flow.
The choice of materials for RVOT reconstruction in CHD patients remains a controversial and inadequate area
of study. Although glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine jugular vein (BJV) (Contegra) is a commonly used material due
to its unlimited availability and lack of antigenic reaction, complications such as stenosis at the distal
anastomosis of the conduit, aneurysm, or pseudoaneurysm have been reported in 6-50% of patients, with an
increased risk of infection after implantation. The glutaraldehyde crosslinking process results in a stiff and
calcification-prone tissue material, leading to early failure of the bioprosthetic device. Recent studies have
highlighted that the early failure of bioprosthetic valves may not only be attributed to calcification but also to
non-calcification mechanisms such as accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), altered
collagen microstructure, and elevated tissue crosslinking. Glutaraldehyde treatment also prevents cellular
repopulation of the tissues, making them incapable of cell-mediated remodeling and leading to the
accumulation of AGE-related products. Pediatric patients with a higher metabolism have a higher risk of
structural valve failure, which results in multiple re-operations throughout their lifetime. There is, therefore, an
urgent need to develop more durable pulmonary valved grafts that are resistant to calcification,
inflammation, thrombosis, and accumulation of AGEs, and that have regenerative potential, as a safe
reconstructive device for pediatric patients.
We propose to develop a pulmonary valved graft (PVG) from a decellularized and pentagalloyl glucose (PGG)
treated (Also referred to as TxGuardTM) bovine jugular vein. TxGuardTM PVG will be non-thrombogenic,
infection- and calcification-resistant, prevent accumulation of AGEs, and have a potential to remodel
and grow. Based on reproducible pre-clinical data during STTR Phase 1 and SBIR Phase II, we firmly believe
that the new device would provide an improved option for millions of patients than what is currently available.
Proposed specific aims for SBIR Phase IIB are: Aim 1: Design freeze of TxGuardTM PVG for final testing for
FDA submission. Sub-aim 1.1 - Optimizing and validating sterilization for TxGuardTM PVG. Sub-aim 1.2 -
Optimizing and validating packaging and storage for TxGuardTM PVG. Aim 2: Evaluate GMP grade TxGuardTM
PVG for material biocompatibility as per the ISO 10993 standards for permanent (>30 days) blood/ tissue
contact device. Aim 3: Test the final TxGuardTM PVG device for function in vitro and in vivo for FDA
submission. Sub-aim 3.1 - Hydrodynamic performance (steady flow pressure drop, steady backflow leakage,
pulsatile flow pressure drop, pulsatile flow regurgitation) for different conduit sizes and accelerated wear testing
(AWT) for three different sizes. Sub-aim 3.2 - Perform extended (140 days) GLP pre-clinical in-vivo testing
for TxGuardTM PVG (n=6) in growing lambs and compared to the clinically available Contegra BJV or
equivalent conduits (n=3). The outcome of these studies will be used for the FDA submission for the new
device approval following the Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) guidelines.

The Philadelphia Regional Stroke Trials Network Coordinating Center (PRSTNCC) is a highly effective collaborative stroke research team comprised of adult and pediatric vascular neurologists, neurosurgeons, neuroradiologists, emergency physicians, rehabilitation specialists, and other experts who conduct clinical trials focused on stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery. The PRSTNCC is based at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), an urban, tertiary care, academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA, which serves as the ""Hub"" of the consortium, and has joined forces with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and 13 additional member hospitals (""Spokes"") located in geographically and ethnically diverse areas in and around Philadelphia. The PRSTNCC thereby unites comprehensive stroke centers, primary stroke centers, and a regional pediatric center, providing access to a broad and diverse population of patients with stroke to a multidisciplinary group of clinicians and researchers. The overarching goal of the PRSTNCC is to reduce the burden of stroke among patients of all ages and backgrounds within this region by conducting interdisciplinary trials of promising clinical interventions for stroke treatment, prevention, and recovery. The multi-disciplinary PRSTNCC leadership team, led by Multiple Principal Investigators (MPIs) Scott Kastner, MD, and Brett Cucchiara, MD, has extensive experience conducting multicenter stroke clinical trials, and has been a major contributor to the current NIH Stroke Net. The PRSTNCC infrastructure supports efficient and effective conduct of stroke trials among the participant hospitals. Research support and expertise are provided by the Hub, particularly in the areas of human subjects protections and other regulatory activities, and education and orientation of clinical and research staff in an effort to streamline trial implementation and expedite patient enrollment. The Hub provides ongoing support for data collection and transfer during trial execution, and provides timely feedback and education about trial results to member specialists and hospitals to encourage translation of research results into clinical practice. In addition, we are training a new generation of stroke researchers and coordinators in the conduct and design of clinical trials by providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary for a successful academic career as independently-funded clinician-scientists."
10806363,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) affect 10% of pregnancies in the United States and are associated with
future cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, with significantly higher prevalence and worse outcomes among Black women
and women with low incomes. Timely identification and management of CVD risk factors (e.g., blood pressure control)
after HDPs leads to substantial and sustained improvements in cardiovascular health. Yet only 25-50% of patients receive
recommended care in the year after HDPs, with further inequities by race and income. Therefore, inadequate care after
HDPs is a critical missed opportunity to promote cardiovascular health and health equity among women. Unfortunately,
efforts to improve cardiovascular health after HDPs are limited by key gaps in evidence and approach. First, there is a
general need for more data on CVD risk and cardiovascular health in diverse populations. Second, such data must be
followed rigorous implementation of evidence-based interventions that address social and structural factors, with
stakeholder engagement. In response, Dr. Murray Horwitz has developed a plan to address large knowledge gaps, work
with diverse stakeholders to adapt an evidence-based intervention and prepare for its successful implementation, and
pilot-test the intervention, to improve cardiovascular health equity after HDPs. Her 3 specific aims are to: (1) Examine the
distribution of cardiovascular health (measured by Life’s Essential 8) in a diverse nationwide sample of patients with prior
HDPs (n~40,000), then identify key care gaps along the pathway from HDPs to cardiovascular health (e.g., access to
outpatient care, CVD risk assessment), and finally identify multi-level predictors of a key point of drop-off (e.g., access to
outpatient care). These findings will inform adaptations to a postpartum patient navigation intervention, to ensure that it
addresses priority populations and modifiable barriers to cardiovascular health after HDPs. (2) Conduct stakeholder-
engaged qualitative research in 2 health care settings, to contextualize care pathways in the year after HDPs, then identify
potential implementation barriers for the planned patient navigation intervention. Findings will be used to refine the
implementation strategy for the intervention, prior to pilot testing. (3) Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the
feasibility and acceptability of a postpartum patient navigation intervention, adapted to improve cardiovascular health after
HDPs, in a large safety net hospital (n=30/group, 60 total). Trial results will inform further improvements to the intervention
and implementation strategy, to be followed by multi-site effectiveness testing. Her research aims reflect the NHLBI’s
Strategic Vision, to, “Reduce health disparities and inequities […] by leveraging epidemiology […] to understand and solve
complex health problems.” They also serve as vehicles for her training goals, as follows: (1) Develop expertise in
advanced modeling techniques, specifically multi-level modeling and risk prediction; (2) Establish competency in learning
health system science, specifically in the areas of community engagement, equity & justice, improvement &
implementation science frameworks, and research methods; and (3) Gain skills in pragmatic clinical trial design &
conduct. This award will facilitate Dr. Murray Horwitz’s long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator who
develops and disseminates interventions that improve cardiovascular health and health equity among women."
10922818,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Although oral health is an integral part of overall health for pregnant women, studies show that only 23-59% of
women went to the dentist while pregnant. In North Carolina, the Medicaid for Pregnant Women (MPW) program
provides dental services to women during pregnancy. However, dental utilization by low-income pregnant
women in North Carolina ranged from 1–26%. Pregnant women should have regular dental visits to avoid
gingivitis and periodontitis, which are associated with increased risk of pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, and low
birth weight infants. Dental visits during pregnancy are important for the treatment of current issues and for
receiving education on their oral health and their child's oral health. We believe that identifying and addressing
the oral health barriers experienced by this population, as well as creating a welcoming, culturally sensitive
environment, will positively influence pregnant women's own oral health and their children's. To achieve this
goal, we will use a community-based participatory research approach called photovoice. First, we will determine
barriers to maintaining good oral health behaviors and accessing dental care among low-income
pregnant women and mothers of infants. Second, we will determine the perspectives of women's health
care providers/midwives/obstetricians on barriers faced by pregnant women on maintaining good oral
health and identify sustainable interventions that could support them on this behavior. We will partner
with the community to develop options that support family participation in preventive oral healthcare and develop
practical solutions to remove barriers and enable family-level behavior changes that are sustainable. Our ultimate
goal is to have data that will inform the development of a community-engaged oral health program targeting
pregnant women that will aim to improve their oral health and that of their children during early childhood."

Nucleolin recognition of MYC promoter G-quadruplex and its role in MYC regulation by MycG4-ligands
G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical DNA secondary structures. c-Myc, one of the central driver oncogenes
in human cancers, has a DNA G4 motif in its proximal promoter region that functions as a transcription silencer.
However, little is known about how the c-Myc promoter G4 (MycG4) is regulated. Nucleolin is identified as the
major c-Myc G4 binding protein and shows a remarkably higher binding affinity for MycG4 over its known cellular
substrate NRE RNA. Nucleolin directly binds to the MycG4 promoter region in vivo and overexpression of
nucleolin represses the activity of the c-Myc promoter. We hypothesize that nucleolin recognizes the c-Myc
promoter G4 and that MycG4-targeted small molecules regulate c-Myc gene expression through interactions
with the nucleolin-MycG4 complex. In this proposal, we will study how nucleolin recognizes MycG4 by
determining the molecular structure of the nucleolin-MycG4 complex. We will also study how small molecules
interact with the nucleolin-MycG4 complex and how the interactions affect c-Myc transcription. The c-Myc
promoter G4 is an attractive anticancer drug target. Our preliminary data show that the nucleolin-MycG4 complex
is clearly involved in the c-Myc regulation by MycG4-ligands. The proposed research represents the first
structural and functional study of the nucleolin-MycG4 complex. A structural level understanding of the nucleolin-
MycG4 complex and its interactions with small molecules will provide important information for MycG4 function
and MycG4-targeted drug development. The proposed research will use a combination of high-field NMR
spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and other biophysical, biochemical, and cellular approaches. We have
assembled a strong collaboration team. The specific aims are: 1) To determine the structure of nucleolin in
complex with the c-Myc promoter G-quadruplex. Nucleolin is a multi-domain protein containing four tandem RNA-
binding domains (RBDs). We hypothesize that nucleolin uses all four RBDs to wrap around MycG4 and recognize
the G4 external loops to achieve a high-affinity binding. This structure would be the first to show how the unusual
DNA G4 structure is recognized by a modular protein, likely through multi-valent interactions. 2) To investigate
how small molecules interact with the nucleolin-MycG4 complex and their effects on c-Myc gene regulation. Our
preliminary data shows that only MycG4-ligands that stabilize the nucleolin-MycG4 complex can lower c-Myc
levels. We will use a combination of in vitro and cell-based assays to identify compounds that can stabilize the
nucleolin-MycG4 complex and downregulate c-Myc. We will determine the specificity for the c-Myc gene and
determine major cellular response for the top compounds. For the MycG4-ligands that form the stable ternary
complexes with nucleolin-MycG4, we will also determine the structural basis of the nucleolin-MycG4 stabilization."
10817903,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A central goal of genomics is to understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype. In recent years,
the ability to quantitatively study genotype-phenotype maps has been revolutionized by the development of
multiplex assays of variant effect (MAVEs), which measure molecular phenotypes for thousands to millions of
genotypic variants in parallel. MAVE is an umbrella term that includes massively parallel reporter assays for
studies of DNA or RNA regulatory sequences, as well as deep mutational scanning assays of proteins or
structural RNAs. The rapid adoption of MAVE techniques across multiple genomic disciplines has created an
acute need for computational methods that can robustly and reproducibly infer quantitative genotype-
phenotype (G-P) maps from the large datasets that MAVEs produce. Here we propose a unified conceptual
and computational framework for quantitatively modeling G-P maps from MAVE data. This proposal is
motivated by our realization that accounting for the noise and nonlinearities that are omnipresent in MAVE
experiments requires explicit modeling of both the MAVE measurement process and the G-P map of interest.
This joint inference strategy is more computationally demanding than most MAVE analysis methods, but it is
feasible using modern deep learning frameworks. Our extensive preliminary data show that this modeling
strategy is able to recover high-precision G-P maps even in the presence of major confounding effects, and
thus has the potential to benefit MAVE studies in multiple areas of genomics. Aim 1 will develop methods for
modeling the measurement processes that arise in diverse MAVE experimental designs. Aim 2 will develop
general methods for modeling genetic interactions within G-P maps, and will use these methods in conjunction
with new experiments to elucidate the molecular mechanism of a recently approved drug that targets
alternative mRNA splicing. Aim 3 will develop methods for inferring G-P maps that reflect biophysical models
of gene regulation, including both thermodynamic (i.e., quasi-equilibrium) and kinetic (i.e., non-equilibrium
steady-state) models. These methods will then be used, in conjunction with new MAVE experiments, to
develop a biophysical model for how a pleiotropic transcription factor regulates gene expression throughout the
Escherichia coli genome. Aim 4 will study and develop methods for treating gauge freedoms and sloppy
modes in the above classes of models, thereby facilitating the comparison, interpretation, and exploration of
inferred G-P maps. All of the computational techniques we develop will be incorporated into a robust and easy-
to-use Python package called MAVE-NN. We will benchmark MAVE-NN on a diverse array of MAVE datasets,
including published datasets and data generated as part of this project. In all, this work will fill a major need in
the analysis of MAVE experiments, yielding a robust, flexible, and scalable computational platform that will help
accelerate the use of MAVEs for understanding the effects of human genetic variation at the genomic scale."

10819403,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer in adults. Over 10,000 people are estimated to
die yearly from GBM despite aggressive treatment, and there has been no substantial improvement in GBM
patient survival for more than four decades (5-year survival rate: mid-1970s 4% vs. 7% today), emphasizing the
need for new therapies. A hallmark of GBM is an acidic tumor microenvironment, which promotes tumor
progression. GPR68 is a proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor activated in response to an acidic
microenvironment and implicated in cancer-related processes. Proton Bio co-founders identified the first class
of specific GPR68 inhibitors, the ogremorphins, that potently kill a diverse panel of GBM cells through ferroptosis,
a novel form of iron-dependent regulated cell death, even those resistant to first-line therapy temozolomide,
providing the foundation for the hypothesis that targeting GPR68 represents a novel therapeutic approach
against GBM. While the parent ogremorphin had poor pharmacological properties that precluded in vivo
validation of this hypothesis, structure-activity relationship analysis yielded improved analogs. Three analogs
have been selected as lead candidates. The objectives of this Phase I project are to select a lead ogremorphin
and to perform critical proof-of-concept testing in orthotopic GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). To achieve
these objectives, the following three specific aims will be pursued: 1) define the in vitro pharmacological
properties of the ogremorphin lead candidates, 2) determine the detailed PK/brain accumulation profiles of
ogremorphin lead candidates, and 3) demonstrate proof-of-concept that targeting GPR68 with the lead
ogremorphin is efficacious against GBM in vivo. In Aim 1, the three lead candidates will be compared side-by-
side for plasma protein binding, cytochrome P450 inhibition, microsomal stability, and hERG inhibition. In Aim 2,
the pharmacokinetics and brain penetration of the lead candidates will be determined following oral
administration in CD-1 mice. From the data generated in Aims 1 and 2, the lead ogremorphin will be selected. In
Aim 3, critical proof-of-concept efficacy studies will be performed using orthotopic temozolomide-sensitive and
temozolomide-resistant GBM PDX models. Treatment effects will be monitored by survival, MRI analysis of tumor
growth, histology and immunohistochemistry. Successful establishment of proof-of-concept will validate GPR68
as a therapeutic target in GBM and move the lead ogremorphin into development. The development of GRP68
inhibitors as therapeutics could potentially revolutionize GBM treatment and finally bring about a welcome shift
in the 5-year survival of GBM patients."
10819719,"Preventing Chronic Postsurgical Pain (CPSP) and reducing postsurgical opioid exposure is a public health
imperative. Perioperative insomnia is an increasingly recognized modifiable risk factor for CPSP and opioid
usage, but studies have yet to evaluate whether treating insomnia perioperatively reduces CPSP and opioid
exposure. Insomnia has been linked to central nervous system alterations that contribute to the transition from
acute to chronic pain and is prevalent in at least 50% of older adults with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), awaiting
total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Currently, TKA for end stage KOA is the most common elective surgical
procedure in the US. Rates of CPSP after TKA are high with ~ 20% of individuals reporting moderate to severe
CPSP. Research determining whether optimizing sleep improves TKA outcomes is critical because TKAs are
estimated to increase exponentially to 3.5 million per annum in the next decade. Benzodiazepine receptor
agonists, the most commonly used therapies for insomnia are contraindicated in older adults and especially
dangerous in the context of opioid pain management. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi), is a
safe, well-established treatment for insomnia that improves sleep in chronic pain and has demonstrated small,
but significant effects on pain severity that require enhancement. Emerging data suggests that morning bright
light treatment (MBLT) not only improves circadian rhythms and sleep, it has mood enhancing and analgesic
properties. Although both CBTi and MBLT have distinct mechanisms of action, research on their combination is
just emerging and neither has been used to prevent CPSP or reduce opioid use. We propose a randomized,
controlled, parallel arm, clinical trial, to test the effects of CBTi and CBTi+MBLT on CPSP and opioid sparing
following TKA. Five weeks prior to surgery, TKA patients with insomnia will be randomized to one of 3
conditions matched on timing and contact duration: 1) CBTi+placebo [four pre-surgical telehealth sessions +
two post-TKA boosters (2-week and 3 mo. post TKA)] with 1-hour daily morning deactivated ion generator
sham exposure (placebo) for 4-wks. pre and 4-wks. post-surgery; 2) CBTi+MBLT (1-hour daily morning bright
light treatment for 4-wks. pre and 4-wks. post-surgery), and 3) Education (EDU)+placebo with 1-hour daily
morning deactivated ion generator exposure (4-wks. pre and 4-wks. post-surgery). Outcomes will be assessed
at baseline, post CBT-I (pre-surgery), 6-weeks, 3, and 6-months post-surgery. We have three aims: 1) To
evaluate the effects of perioperative CBTi+placebo and CBTi+MBLT on CPSP [(3-6 mos.) primary] and opioid
use [(6 weeks-6 mos.) 2ndry]; 2) To examine the effects of CBTi+placebo and CBTi+MBLT on pre-surgical,
acute post-surgical (6-weeks), and chronic (3, 6 months) insomnia symptom severity, circadian rest activity
rhythm (RAR), and depressed mood; 3) (exploratory) Evaluate whether the effects of treatment condition on
CPSP and opioid use from 3 to 6 months post-TKA are partially mediated by improvements in insomnia
severity, increases in circadian RAR strength and decreases in depressed mood at 6-weeks post-TKA."
10819705,"On February 3, 2023, a freight train carrying vinyl chloride (VC) and other chemicals derailed in East Palestine,
OH. VC leaked into the air, soil, surface water, and groundwater, potentially impacting indoor air and drinking
water. Population characteristics: East Palestine Village- 5000 people: 94% white, 21% are 65 years and older,
no residential mobility (1%), 10% veterans, median income $44,500, and 9.1% poverty. Residents are
increasingly concerned about returning home and the long-term effects on their health and environment. Most
of our understanding of the impact of VC exposure on human health is derived from occupational exposure
studies. Environmental disasters can result in chronic psycho-social stress, further negatively impacting health
outcomes in at-risk individuals. Psycho-social stress increases organismal inflammation and enhances organ
damage, including cardiometabolic disease. The purpose of this time-sensitive proposal is to deploy a
community-engaged approach to collect, bank and analyze a subsample of environmental- biospecimen- and
psychosocial stress data to mitigate the immediate and long-term impacts of exposures to VC and other VOCs
spilled during the derailment disaster. Aim 1. Embed a community-engaged approach to address
environmental- and health concerns. From study design to dissemination of results, we will deploy citizen
science strategies to actively engage community members in collecting environmental samples, biospecimens
and health outcome data on the interaction of psycho-social stress and VC exposure. The study population will
consist of 300 participants living close to the spill and the contaminated surface water streams. Aim 2.
Characterize environmental exposure risks to VC and PFAS. Outdoors: surface water, soil and sediment
samples of key sites where the greatest exposure risks exist. Residential sampling: air and well water samples
will be collected from 100 homes, supplied by both municipal and artesian wells. Sampling instruments will
include traditional indoor air samples. Geospatial analyses will be conducted to determine and predict
dispersion/drainage patterns. Environmental samples will be collected and banked annually for 2 years. Aim 3.
Collect baseline biomarker- and psychosocial data. Blood and urine samples will be collected annually from
300 participants and semi- annually in a subset of 150 to assess liver damage over time and banked for future
biomarker- and mechanistic studies. Biomarker analyses will be conducted in a subset of participants guided by
geospatial “heatmaps” of the indoor exposure continuum. To measure psychosocial stress, we will collaborate
with community leaders to select instruments in the DR2 portfolio, including PSS, PHQ-9 and GAD-7.
Anticipated impact.1) Time-sensitive environmental-and biobanking will expeditiously mitigate exposure risks
in an underserved community; 2) the banked samples serve as valuable baseline data for more comprehensive
cohort studies examining the cumulative impact of exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors;3) early
community engagement helps build trust and collaboration now and in the future."
10823217,"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted healthcare. These changes are likely to have
especially profound implications for Veterans obtaining regular care for chronic conditions, such as chronic
pain—particularly when Veterans are obtaining nonpharmacologic treatments, which often require regular, in-
person visits. Although virtual care delivery in VA increased dramatically in response to the pandemic and is
unlikely to diminish, it is unclear what services Veterans with pain have received via virtual delivery and how
Veterans have been affected by these shifts. The goal of this project is to understand changes in VA chronic
pain care after COVID-19 and their associated impacts—and use these data to develop strategies to optimize
delivery of VA pain services in a post-COVID-19 environment.
Significance: This project addresses priorities in HSR&D's Targeted Solicitation on Opioid Safety and Opioid
Use Disorder. Specifically, this project is responsive to priority area E, “examination of the impact of the
COVID-19 public health emergency on the effective treatment of chronic pain, including effects on access to
care, medication and treatment modalities, patient function and satisfaction.” Despite the clear impact on care
delivery exerted by the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about how these changes and disruptions have
affected Veterans and their chronic pain care, including their ability to access care after the onset of the
pandemic. These concerns are reflected in our pilot data, which indicate that Veterans have felt the impact of
service disruptions on their pain management.
Innovation and Impact: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet well-understood. This project takes
a mixed-methods approach to examine changes in chronic pain care since the onset of the pandemic, working
with an expert stakeholder panel at each stage of the research to ensure results and recommendations are
disseminated rapidly to maximize impact.
Specific Aims: Aim 1 (quantitative): Describe changes in pain management visits for Veterans with chronic low-
back pain (cLBP) following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Aim 2 (qualitative): Explain differential
patterns of receipt of services identified in Aim 1 and perceived impacts. Aim 3: Share findings throughout the
project, including final, integrated findings from Aims 1 and 2, and develop short- and long-term strategies to
optimize delivery of pain care for Veterans in a post-COVID-19 environment.
Methodology: This study uses an embedded mixed-methods design. In Aim 1 a retrospective cohort of
Veterans receiving care for cLBP will be established. Receipt of guideline-recommended, nonpharmacological
pain management services, including changes in service receipt following the onset of COVID-19, will be
examined. Veteran and facility factors associated with differential changes will be tested. Once the first phase
of Aim 1 analyses is complete, qualitative sampling for Aim 2 will begin. Thus, consistent with an embedded
design, most Aim 1 and Aim 2 activities will take place concurrently. Qualitative interviews with clinicians,
administrators, and Veterans will be conducted to better understand how they experienced pandemic-related
changes, including any effects on their current practice/service delivery, and to identify positive changes made
since the pandemic that could serve as examples for other facilities. In Aim 3 we will work with our stakeholder
advisory panel, led by the VA Office of Pain Management, to develop comprehensive recommendations to
guide VA on policies to optimize delivery of pain management services in a post-COVID-19 environment.
Next Steps: Findings will be directly applied to VA care, as directed by the CIPHER stakeholder panel (led by
the VA National Pain Management Office). Future research will examine implementation strategies aimed at
supporting VA-wide implementation."
10823327,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people in the United States (US) experience significant health disparities
throughout the life course relative to cisgender people. While extensive community-based research drawn from
convenience samples and a burgeoning body of research using population-level data has assessed the
healthcare utilization of TGD individuals, much of this research has focused on younger TGD people. Little
national data exist on the health of older TGD people (i.e., 55 and older). Older adults, regardless of gender
identity, are at increased risk of developing comorbidities that burden the healthcare system. TGD older adults
are expected to be at even higher risk of developing multiple, concurrent health problems than cisgender people
due to the stigma-related stress they experience throughout their lives. Further, like all people, TGD people
require routine care and, often acute and post-acute care as they age; however, TGD individuals also have
unique medical gender affirmation needs (e.g., hormones or surgery) and a dearth of research has explored the
ways in which the use of these services shape older TGD people's use of other routine and acute care. The
long-term goal of this research agenda is to improve healthcare quality and ultimately the health of older TGD
people. The overall objective of this study is to create a comprehensive understanding of the comorbidities and
healthcare use of older TGD adults. Consistent with NOT-MD-19-001: “Research on the Health of Sexual and
Gender Minority (SGM) Population,” we propose to do use novel algorithms to identify a sample of 30,000+ older
TGD people in Medicare data and follow their outcomes across 10 years of outpatient, acute- and post-acute
claims and assessment data. We will also link Medicare data to state-level data and use qualitative methods to
understand the multilevel factors that shape health outcomes for older TGD adults. To achieve these goals, we
propose the following Aims: 1) To describe the prevalence and incidence of single and comorbid chronic
conditions among TGD Medicare beneficiaries and to compare the healthcare utilization of TGD and cisgender
beneficiaries; 2) To understand how individual, healthcare system, and community factors influence health and
healthcare use of older TGD adults relative to older cisgender adults; and 3) To contextualize the quantitative
findings by qualitatively assessing (via patient and provider interviews) the individual, healthcare system, and
community-level barriers and facilitators to optimal health and healthcare utilization for older TGD adults that can
be addressed in future multilevel interventions. This project is innovative because we will use datasets, methods,
and outcomes that have not been previously applied to understanding the health of the older adult TGD
population. This work will have a significant impact as it will yield novel, clinically-important, and policy-relevant
evidence about how older TGD adults are cared for as they become more significantly ill. Finally, completion of
this study will lay the groundwork for future multilevel interventions to improve the care of and health of the older
TGD population in the US."
10823328,"Project Summary
Overall goal of this application is to advance our understanding of ACE2 biology in the lung, to explore a
novel link between ACE2 activity and the interferon-γ-mediated compromised innate immunity in IAV and
subsequent bacterial lung infection, and to lay the groundwork for a new strategy to prevent and treat lethal
IAV-bacterial coinfection by manipulating ACE2 activity. Infection with secondary bacterial pathogens is the
primary cause of excess mortality during influenza A virus (IAV) outbreaks. Novel therapies that modulate host
immunity are urgently needed. Moreover, compelling evidence indicates that the immune defects caused by IAV
infection are responsible for the severe secondary bacterial lung infection. These include impaired neutrophil influx
due to sustained desensitization and the induction of an immune-suppressive state of the lung. The renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) is constitutively activated to maintain blood pressure and to mount a host defense to invading
microbes. However, overactive RAS facilitates exacerbated inflammatory response, while repressive RAS curbs host
defense. Thus, regulation of optimal RAS signaling may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in a bacterial lung
infection. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a potent negative regulator of the RAS activation. Our
preliminary studies in a mouse model of IAV-bacterial coinfection indicate that pulmonary ACE2 is dynamically
regulated during IAV infection and peaked around 6 dpi. Interestingly, the IAV induced interferon- γ induces ACE2
expression. We also find that the elevated pulmonary ACE2 activity at the time of secondary bacterial infection
mitigates neutrophilic inflammation and increases the severity of the secondary bacterial infection. The observation
raises the possibility that the IAV infection induced ACE2 activity, partially by interferon- γ, predispose the mice to
secondary bacterial lung infection by attenuating neutrophilic inflammatory response. Our overall hypothesis is
that is that ACE2 plays a pivotal role in the IAV induced-IFN- γ mediated immune compromise, thus contributes
to the pathogenesis of secondary bacterial lung infection post IAV, and that optimal strategy to manipulate
active ACE2 will improve the outcome of IAV-bacterial coinfection. We propose the following aims:
Aim1. To investigate the role and mechanism of IFN- γ induced pulmonary ACE2 in IAV-bacterial coinfection.
manipulate active ACE2 will improve the outcome of IAV-bacterial coinfection. Aim2. To elucidate the mechanisms
through which pulmonary ACE2 modulates neutrophil influx in IAV-bacterial coinfection. Aim3. To evaluate the
preventive and interventional strategies to IAV-bacteria co-infection by monitoring serum and manipulating
pulmonary ACE2 activity.
These studies will make a significant conceptual advance and pre-clinical insight by defining the role and
therapeutic potential of ACE2 in IAV-bacterial lung disease."
10819991,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infective Endocarditis (IE) occurs when bacteria or fungi adhere to the endocardial surface forming small lesions.
This invasive disease is characterized by a mortality rate exceeding 25%, is associated with extended
hospitalization, and often impairs the quality of life for those who survive. Early microbial diagnosis and
antimicrobial intervention are crucial to improved patient outcomes and reduced hospitalization time. However,
currently accepted diagnostic approaches still rely on primary blood culture, which exhibits long and variable
turnaround times and are prone to false-negative results. There is therefore a significant need for new diagnostic
approaches that do not require culture and provide faster, more accurate results.
To address this unmet need, HelixBind developed RaPID/IE, a fully automated sample-to-answer test which
identifies and characterizes these infections directly from blood in ~3 hours, without cultures. Implemented on
the RaPID (Resistance and Pathogen IDentification) platform and appropriate for placement throughout the
hospital, RaPID/IE incorporates a broad test menu including both bacterial and fungal pathogens, as well as a
marker of antimicrobial resistance. Crucially, the test is not compromised by prior antimicrobial treatment and
provides species level detail with single CFUs/ml sensitivity, enabling selection of appropriate antimicrobials.
Commercialization of RaPID/IE will provide timely identification and characterization of the invasive agent and
thus enable intervention with targeted antimicrobial treatment. This is expected to result in improved patient
outcomes and a reduction in the use of unnecessary antimicrobials, slowing the rise of antimicrobial resistance.
HelixBind has met and exceeded all the Specific Aims defined in the Phase II SBIR. This included menu
expansion to cover antibiotic resistance as well as pathogens associated with IE which cannot be recovered by
clinical cultures, automation of the assay onto single-use disposables operated by a benchtop instrument, and
successful completion of a preliminary clinical study. In addition, and based on feedback from potential
customers, the menu was expanded further to include coverage of pathogens associated with conditions sharing
symptoms with IE. Additional analytical testing was performed to ensure the assay meets product specifications.
In this proposed Phase IIB, HelixBind will build on our success in Phase II to advance RaPID/IE by addressing
potential risks associated with direct from blood detection of antimicrobial resistance, increasing the product’s
room-temperature shelf life, and completing a prospective clinical study on-site at a partner hospital. Upon
completion of this project, we will be well placed to initiate analytical and clinical studies for FDA premarket
notification and clearance of RaPID/IE."
10819770,"Elucidating Host Responses to AAV Ocular Gene Therapy Vectors
Vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV) have been clinically validated for gene therapy to treat ocular
diseases. This was showcased in 2017 by the FDA approval of Luxturna, an AAV2-based gene therapy to treat
an inherited form of blindness. Luxturna made history by becoming the first FDA-approved therapy to treat a
genetic disease. Despite its clinical success, intraocular inflammation and toxicity has been reported for Luxturna
and other AAV-based therapies for retinal disease. Gene expression data from the literature has demonstrated
that double-stranded (dsRNA)-responsive pathways, such as the RIG-I and MDA5 signaling pathways, are
upregulated upon subretinal and systemic administration of AAV gene therapy vectors in mice and non-human
primates. AAV vectors have also been previously documented to exhibit intrinsic promoter activity within the
inverted terminal repeats (ITRs), which can produce sense and antisense transcripts in transduced cells.
Unpublished data from our lab has shown a slight (but not statistically significant) alleviation of toxicity upon
subretinal injection of a toxic AAV into mice lacking functional MAVS (a dsRNA signaling adaptor) relative to
wild-type controls. Taken together, these data suggest that there may be a role for dsRNA sensing pathways in
mediating AAV ocular toxicity, which we hope to test directly using the experiments in Aim 1. We hypothesize
that ITR-directed sense and antisense transcripts in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) hybridize to
produce dsRNA, which activates cellular dsRNA sensors like RIG-I, MDA5, or others leading to ocular
toxicity. Because MAVS KO data did not produce full rescue of cone toxicity, nor did any other single innate or
adaptive KO strain tested, we hypothesize there are multiple pathways, immune or non-immune related,
contributing to toxicity. We will therefore perform an unbiased search for other pathways that could be
mediating toxicity in Aim 2 using a spatial transcriptomics approach developed in our lab, Light-Seq. Light-Seq
enables us to read out gene expression in user-defined regions of the same sample (e.g., AAV-transduced vs.
untransduced regions) without requiring cellular dissociation. I will use immunofluorescence (IF) and RNA
fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH, e.g., SABER-FISH or HCR-FISH) coupled with confocal imaging
throughout my proposal to confirm AAV tissue transduction, validate pathway hits, and quantify ocular toxicity.
Additionally, I will use genetic and pharmacologic perturbations to validate pathway candidates. Completion of
this proposal will expand our knowledge of antiviral responses to AAV vectors in the eye and may help guide
development of safer, more effective AAV ocular therapeutics. Additionally, insights gained in this proposal may
inform the development of safer AAV vectors delivered to other organs of therapeutic relevance."
10817538,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Male contraception has remained a long-desired, but yet to be met goal. Critical to this goal is the identification
of a suitable and druggable target, and the availability of adequate compounds. The voltage-gated ion channel
CatSper is an exceptionally promising target for male contraception because it is exclusively expressed in sperm,
is critical for sperm function, and is required for male fertility. Mice in which CatSper has been genetically deleted
are completely infertile. Furthermore, naturally occurring CatSper mutations have been identified as the cause
of male factor infertility in humans. Hits from a high throughput screening (HTS) campaign, blocked high
potassium, high pH- and progesterone induced Ca2+ influx into human sperm. Moreover, these compounds
inhibited cell hyperpolarization and hyperactivated motility (HAM) of human sperm. An ion channel selectivity
screening indicated good selectivity of some hits for CatSper over other ion channels. Based on these data, we
hypothesize that we can discover and develop orally bioavailable highly selective Catsper inhibitors. The
inhibitors will be characterized for inhibition of calcium influx, sperm motility, ion channel selectivity, and in vitro
ADMET assays. Promising compounds will be investigated for pharmacokinetic properties before examining
their effectiveness on reduction of sperm motility and HAM, reversibility in mice and on mating trials in mice. We
will also monitor off-target effects and determine preliminary maximum tolerated doses. The goal for this project
is the development of a preclinical candidate for male contraception."
10817440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Roughly one-fifth of girls in East and Southern Africa (ESA) have given birth by age 20. Social and economic
conditions accompanying the transition to motherhood increase HIV risk for adolescent mothers (AM). Social
protection programs, such as social asset building, educational subsidies, and economic strengthening, have
received growing attention and investment across ESA, and seek to reduce adolescent girls’ HIV risk by
increasing their empowerment, educational attainment, and economic stability. While AMs’ social and
economic realities may introduce unique barriers to participating in such programs, no studies have assessed
the extent to which AMs participate in – or benefit from –these programs. There are also gaps in understanding
which AMs are most likely to participate in social protection programs, which programs AMs are most likely to
use, and which programs are best positioned to decrease sexual risk behavior and increase HIV testing for
AMs after childbirth (when risk continues). Such information is needed to refine or develop programs that reach
AMs, who are highly vulnerable to HIV yet often overlooked in HIV prevention efforts. Therefore, our study
objective is to understand whether AMs participate, which AMs participate and which programs to prioritize to
optimize impacts of HIV prevention initiatives for AMs across countries with high HIV-burden among girls. In
this study, we will leverage publicly available, nationally representative survey data collected between 2019-
2022 from over 14,000 adolescent girls (15-19 years old), of whom 2,600 are mothers, as part of the second
round of the Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) Projects which occurred in 8 countries across
East and Southern Africa to execute the following aims: (1a) Characterize AMs and their access to social
protection within and across countries; (1b) Examine whether adolescent motherhood (versus adolescent non-
motherhood) is associated with lower participation in social protection programs; (1c) Explore whether the
association between social protection programs and HIV outcomes differs for AMs compared to adolescent
non-mothers. (2) Using causal inference approaches, identify which social protection programs would have the
largest impact on decreasing sexual risk behavior and increasing HIV testing among AMs. For Aim 1, we will
use descriptive statistics and multilevel mixed effects regression models to examine differences in participation
in social protection programs among AMs within and across countries. For Aim 2, we will use a simulation-
based approach (the parametric g-formula) to quantify the change in sexual risk behavior/HIV testing that
would result from increasing AMs’ participation in existing programs. In ESA, where adolescent girls’ HIV
prevalence is 3-5X greater than boys’, and where adolescent motherhood increased during the COVID-19
pandemic, refining or developing new social protection programs to reduce HIV risk for AMs is key to meeting
UNAIDS’ 95-95-95 targets by 2030."
10818597,"Despite almost complete absence of adequate data from head-to-head randomized controlled trials,
treatment guidelines and prescription drug insurance formularies typically consider individual drugs within
medication classes as equally effective and equally safe. Yet, incorrect assumptions regarding therapeutic
exchangeability expose patients to suboptimal treatments and adverse clinical outcomes, particularly older
adults, who are disproportionately affected by chronic conditions and are the largest per capita consumers of
prescription medications. Despite its substantial clinical and economic implications, therapeutic exchangeability
remains remarkably understudied and represents a problem without a feasible current solution. We thus
propose a novel and feasible approach to evaluate the therapeutic exchangeability of same-class drugs. The
proposed studies will take advantage of natural experiments created by the structure of the Medicare Part D
drug benefit and the variable financial incentives that Part D plans receive from manufacturers. Due to plan-
specific formulary management strategies, Part D enrollees initiating a new medication often face substantially
different out-of-pocket costs for alternative drugs within the same class. The differences in out-of-pocket costs
among alternative same-class drugs among the hundreds of Part D plans will serve as instrumental variables
(IVs). Because these financial incentives strongly affect the choice of one drug of a class over another and are
independent of the patients’ clinical characteristics (as demonstrated by strong preliminary data), they facilitate
valid IV estimation. Outcome validation from primary medical records and cause of death data from the
National Death Index further improve the rigor of the study. Using existing data on >22 million Medicare beneficiaries, the proposed study will examine 4 carefully selected drug classes to establish a new methodological
framework for the systematic assessment of within-class therapeutic exchangeability from observational data:
1) direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, 2) dipeptidyl
peptidase 4-inhibitors (DPP-4s) for type 2 diabetes, 3) high potency statins for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease, and 4) sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2s) for type 2
diabetes. These were selected based on explicit criteria: high rates of use in Part D beneficiaries, uncertainty
about therapeutic exchangeability within the class, sufficient variation in out-of-pocket costs among alternative
agents, and ability to validly measure outcomes in Medicare claims. We included examples with strong priors
against (DPP-4s and CV outcomes) and for (SGLT-2s and amputations) within-class differences to show we
can reproduce expected findings, and others for which differences are uncertain (e.g., DOACs and ischemic
stroke). This proposal begins a highly promising novel line of work to feasibly generate valid and critically
needed evidence on therapeutic exchangeability within widely-used drug classes among older adults, serve as
the basis for future confirmatory studies, and improve clinical medicine, patient outcomes, and public health."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen

10819143,"Low back and neck pain, which impose major impediments to quality of life and are responsible
for significant productivity loss, are often treated with expensive, sometimes ineffective, and
potentially addictive drugs. Complementary therapies, especially force-based manipulations
(FBMs), have the potential to address these challenges but remain poorly understood especially
for spine pain. The highly multifaceted nature of FBMs complicates a complete understanding
of the physiologic mechanisms involved with pain relief, requiring the integrative synthesis of
neuroscience, physics, engineering, physiology, and clinical fields. To address this need, we will
create a network - SPINEWORK - of researchers from all disciplines interested in exploring the
potential role of FBMs in alleviating spine pain. The network will provide members with the
opportunity to identify new collaborators, to learn about other disciplines, to disseminate ideas
and information to their colleagues and the larger community, and to foster better
interdisciplinary communication. SPINEWORK will support the network of researchers and
activities administered by a set of Committees and will be organized into intersecting and
evolving Working Groups, each made up of members from multiple institutions and traditional
disciplines and focused on specific areas, such as Imaging or Animal Models. The Working
Groups will promote interdisciplinary research through physical and virtual gatherings, white
papers, journal special issues, and video content. A special Working Group on Terminology will
focus on defining a common lexicon for spine pain and forced-based manipulations; this task is
essential because even simple terms can have very different meaning to different communities,
leading to confusion and impeding progress for collaborative teams. SPINEWORK will sponsor a
pilot and facilitation grant program for interdisciplinary collaborative teams formed by its
members. The grants will be focused on opportunities to seed or boost R01 proposals, activities
that build intellectual infrastructure (e.g., think tanks or workshops), and opportunities for
scientists from one discipline immerse in disciplines outside their core area. Annually,
SPINEWORK will bring its members together for a Summit meeting to assess its activities, report
findings, spawn new Working Groups, review progress, and plan for the coming year. Overall,
SPINEWORK's mission is to lay the intellectual groundwork for improved treatment of low back
and neck pain via FBMs by creating and fostering a multidisciplinary, scientifically and culturally
diverse network of researchers from across the spectrum of approaches to understand FBMs
and spine pain."
10806971,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is FDA-cleared for the treatment of depression, obsessive compulsive
disorder, and smoking addiction, and there are ongoing clinical trials for new mental health indications. However,
variable response across patients is a significant limitation of TMS. A contributing factor may be a lack of proper
individualization and reproducibility of the TMS targeting to relevant cortical regions. Accurate individualized
targeting requires neuronavigation systems that track the position of the TMS coil relative to the patient's head.
While a small minority of the FDA-cleared TMS treatment devices incorporate neuronavigation, it has significant
drawbacks, including uncomfortable tracking headgear, reduced accuracy due to headgear movement relative
to the head, time-consuming registration, and high cost of dedicated optical or electromagnetic tracking devices.
Novel technologies that could address the limitations of conventional neuronavigation have recently become
feasible, including inexpensive consumer-grade depth cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms
allowing accurate tracking of natural objects such as faces and heads. Our goal is to leverage these advances
to develop an accurate, low-cost, and trackerless system for TMS computer-vision-based neuronavigation
(CVN). Aim 1 is to use consumer-grade depth cameras to detect keypoints on the subject's head comprising
either conventional reflective markers attached to the head or anatomical landmarks for trackerless navigation.
The algorithms will leverage several features of the cameras, including visible light video feed, infrared depth
scanning, and multi-camera synchronization that can be processed together to robustly extract 3D spatial
information. Aim 2 is to localize the head keypoints in 3D space. To this end, CVN will pair two cameras to
acquire visible and infrared light stereo data. The stereo data will be combined with the less accurate raw depth
information provided by each camera to localize the keypoints in 3D space. Aim 3 is to track the position of the
subject's head relative to the TMS coil. Combining the sparse keypoints, the less accurate but dense surface
information generated by each camera, and multi-frame temporal information, CVN will automatically register
the head position to an MRI-based individual head model or, if one is unavailable, a personalized head template
from a model library. The head position will be computed relative to the TMS coil, which will be tracked with the
same methods and permanently mounted reflective markers. We will fine tune the head tracking algorithms with
data from a diverse sample of human subjects, and the complete CVN system will be tested and compared to a
conventional neuronavigation device both with bench-top measurements and in a study of healthy volunteers to
determine accuracy and reproducibility. Overall, the proposed neuronavigation technology could synergize with
current trends toward fMRI-based personalization of TMS targeting to enable more precise and efficacious
interventions for mental health disorders."
10806973,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Quantification of liver steatosis has weighty implications in management of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (a
condition affecting 75-100 million Americans), diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. Serum
biomarkers, computed tomography, and existing ultrasound methods have low sensitivity or specificity for
steatosis staging. Proton Density Fat Fraction (PDFF) measured by MRI has high accuracy, but is limited by
accessibility and cost. Here we propose a novel ultrasound technology, Spectrum Normalization Attenuation
Imaging (SNAI), to quantify ultrasound attenuation coefficient for accurate liver steatosis staging. SNAI does
not require a calibration phantom, and is robust to rib shadowing as well as phase aberration and reverberation
clutter from the body wall. Accuracy of SNAI for steatosis staging is demonstrated by a promising correlation
coefficient of 0.91 with MRI-PDFF in 50 patients. In this project, we will prototype, optimize, and evaluate SNAI
on a low-cost, pocket-sized, wireless ultrasound probe, which can be conveniently used for screening and
follow-up at the point-of-care setting such as the office of a family doctor or hepatologist.
Specific Aim 1: Technical Development. We will use phantom and patient studies to advance and optimize
SNAI on the the wireless ultrasound probe. Acquisition parameters and post processing algorithms will be
optimized for both fundamental and harmonic SNAI imaging. We will suppress reverberation clutter and correct
for sound speed mismatch in liver for more accurate steatosis quantification.
Specific Aim 2: Patient study. We will use the SNAI prototypes optimized in Aim 1 to study 250 steatosis
patients with clinically indicated MRI-PDFF to investigate the efficacy of SNAI for steatosis quantification.
Correlation analysis will be performed to assess the association of SNAI with MRI-PDFF. Steatosis will also be
categorized as S0, S1, and S2/S3 according to PDFF. Receiver operating characteristic analyses will be
performed to evaluate performance of SNAI for detecting ≥S1 and ≥S2. The agreement between SNAI and
PDFF classification will be evaluated using the Kappa statistic. Fibroscan CAP will be used for benchmarking.
Specific Aim 3: Reproducibility study. Two sonographers and two hepatology residents will repeatedly scan
a subset of subjects (50 patients) studied in Aim 2. Intraclass correlation coefficients will be used to evaluate
the inter-operator agreement for SNAI measurements. The within patient variance component from the model
will provide an estimate of the inter-operator variance, which represents a lower bound for the minimum
detectable difference for longitudinal follow-ups.
Successful completion of this project will result in a safe, cost-effective, and easily accessible ultrasound
solution for accurate quantification of liver steatosis for diagnosis and frequent follow-up of this very large
patient population at point-of-care settings such as the office of a hepatologist or family doctor."

Deficits in working memory (WM) comprise a core, transdiagnostic feature of childhood and adolescent
psychopathology. WM is one of the strongest predictors of clinical and functional outcomes, yet there remains
a dearth of treatments available for WM deficits. WM was historically conceptualized as solely localized to the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while modern technology has established the broader role of the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC). There is evidence to suggest that PPC receives direct input
from PFC, although other evidence suggests the PPC encodes incoming stimuli and feeds forward to the PFC
for the initiation of control functions. I have previously found that frontoparietal theta/gamma oscillations,
particularly theta-gamma coupling, is a neural mechanism underlying WM processes. Novel approaches to
non-invasive brain stimulation, such as intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) can now modulate these
distinct oscillatory dynamics and subsequently examine possible causal or temporal relationships. This award
would build on my preliminary findings and transition my career from a clinician to an independent researcher.
The objective of this Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the necessary
training for me to obtain my career goal of utilizing a multimodal neuroscientific approach to measure and
modulate the neural dynamics underlying neurocognitive deficits in childhood and adolescent
psychopathology. In line with NIMH priorities, the training plan proposed will build upon my clinical
neuropsychology and clinical research foundation to provide comprehensive training and mentorship in two
core areas: 1) Neuromodulation and 2) Computational Neuroscience. In a 2x2 factorial double-blind design, we
will randomize a sample of 40 adolescents (13-17 years) with WM deficits to iTBS at the left DLPFC or inferior
parietal lobule (IPL). Participants will complete an active iTBS session and a sham iTBS session. The primary
outcome will be theta-gamma coupling during WM demands, as measured via electroencephalography during
a spatial WM task immediately before and after iTBS. Aim 1 will examine the effect of iTBS to the PPC on the
encoding stage of WM, while Aim 2 will examine the effect of iTBS to the PFC on the maintenance stage of
WM. Aim 3 will utilize computational neural modeling to identify the neocortical circuitry underlying oscillatory
modulation. My central hypothesis is that the PFC and PPC regions have complimentary roles in executing
WM processes. Further, iTBS can modulate theta-gamma coupling in these regions to improve behavioral
performance. We will establish a framework for modulating oscillatory dynamics in child psychiatry and set the
stage for my first R01 on WM-related frontoparietal oscillatory dynamics and optimal treatment parameters for
adolescent WM deficits. This will provide the foundation required to dedicate my career to measuring and
modulating oscillatory abnormalities in child psychiatry."

 Normal cardiac function requires synchronization of structural and electrical molecules within the heart.
Defects affecting cardiac excitability linked to sudden cardiac death affect ½ million people, and those affecting
contractile function, such as in the case of cardiomyopathy, impact another 5.7 million patients in the U.S. each
year. However, often overlooked are cardiovascular (CV) phenotypes that result in both electrical and contractile
dysfunction. This relationship between contractile and electrical elements is critically important to understand in
the patient with congenital heart disease (CHD). There are now more adults (ACHD) living with CHD than
children, and in this population the most common late manifestation of CHD is a severely complex phenotype
hallmarked by both heart failure and arrhythmia. The ACHD community recognizes the importance of each of
these entities, and has set forth high-priority areas of study surrounding heart failure and arrhythmia, with the
goal of using models aimed at the ‘cellular keystones underlying CHD’. This proposal embraces that focus,
shifting from the study of each of these late CV sequela independently, and taking a broader look at the complex
CHD phenotypes that result in both electrical and contractile dysfunction. We have identified a molecule which
we believe has both CV electrical and contractile consequences, thereby serving as a good foundational model
to study complex phenotypes resulting in combination arrhythmia and heart failure. Ankyrins are a membrane-
associated protein directly linked with targeting ion channels in myocytes, neurons and other excitable cells. In
heart, ankyrins-B and –G, which function to support myocyte actin/spectrin in the cytoskeleton and function in
cellular organization, transport, gating and post-translational modification, are associated with critical membrane
ion channels. Canonical AnkG is required for normal NaV1.5 channel targeting in the heart. However, we have
identified a novel ‘giant’ cardiac ankyrin-G isoform that we implicate is critical for normal cardiac structure,
contractility and electrical conduction. Mice lacking ‘Giant AnkG’ display a dilated and thinned left ventricle with
reduced systolic function, consistent with a dilated cardiomyopathy phenotype. These same mice also exhibit
electrical dysfunction including ventricular arrhythmia and high-degree heart block. Our new preliminary data
support our central hypothesis: A single ankyrin gene produces two separate molecules- each with unique roles
in cardiac structural and electrical function. We hypothesize that novel cardiac Giant AnkG functions via a unique
sodium-channel independent mechanism leading to regulation myocyte structure, membrane organization and
abnormal intra- and inter-cellular signaling. Ultimately, loss of function of this large gene product leads to altered
myocardial contraction and defective electrical function."
10807119,"Project Summary/Abstract
Interstitial lung disease (ILD) occurs in the majority of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is the leading
cause of death in SSc. While immunosuppressive therapy has become a standard of care for patients with
SSc-ILD, data from randomized controlled trials demonstrate that there are distinct clinical ILD phenotypes,
including those who experience improvement in lung function with immunosuppression and those who
experience progressive deterioration despite immunosuppression. Understanding the clinical and biological
characteristics of these distinct SSc-ILD phenotypes is central to identifying SSc-ILD patients with who are
most likely to benefit from immunosuppression therapy (i.e. cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate) and those in
whom alternative treatments (anti-fibrotics, stem cell transplant) should be considered. This proposal aims to
investigate baseline clinical and biological features of SSc-ILD patients as predictors of treatment response to
immunosuppressive therapy, and in doing so, take the first steps towards developing a precision medicine
model for managing patients with this disabling and often fatal disease. This study will first explore whether a
focused group of proteins measured in bronchalveolar lavage and plasma/serum samples are correlated with
with surrogate measures of SSc-ILD severity (Aim 1). Those proteins found to correlate with SSc-ILD severity
measures will be subsequently tested for their ability to predict treatment response to immunosuppression
based on the course of the forced vital capacity (FVC) measured at multiple time points over two years using
data from the Scleroderma Lung Study (SLS) II (Aim 2a). SLS II was a 14-center, randomized controlled trial
comparing cyclophosphamide with mycophenolate for SSc-ILD; all patients in this study had well-characterized
SSc-ILD, uniform follow up measurements, equal access to health care and a standard treatment approach.
The proposed prediction model will also include clinical features, as well as innovative measures of ILD
severity, such as the quantitative extent of lung fibrosis/ILD on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT).
This study will also explore whether changes in the levels of select peripherally measured proteins predict
response to immunosuppression (Aim 2b). An external, prospective cohort of SSc-ILD patients treated and
followed in a similar manner as those in SLS II will be used to validate the prediction model (Aim 3).
Completion of the proposed project and accompanying training plan will facilitate the candidate's short-term
goal of developing new skills in cytokine measurement, quantitative imaging analysis, longitudinal data
analysis, and precision medicine. Acquiring formal training in these areas will help the candidate fulfill her long-
term goal of becoming an independent NIH-funded investigator focused on the application of precision
medicine to discover and define specific SSc-ILD phenotypes and endotypes. The proposed integrative
analysis can also be applied to future proposals aiming to unearth phenotypes of ILD due to other connective
tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and myositis."
10809008,"The microbiome and mucosal immunity in cervical cancer disparities
 African American women living in the United States continue to experience an undue higher burden of
cervical cancer and a >2 times higher mortality rate than European American women. This survival disparity
persists after accounting for socioeconomic status and disease stage. The presence of high-risk human
papillomavirus (HPV) is the major cause of cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Prophylactic
vaccines are available against the most carcinogenic types and are highly effective, but disparities persist and
the number of people receiving the vaccine remains suboptimal especially for African American women, and the
vaccine is ineffective for the 40% of female US population already infected with genital HPV. Treatment options
for advanced stages are limited, and metastatic cancer is incurable. New therapeutic approaches are therefore
needed but the mucosal mechanisms contributing to disease pathogenesis in African American women are not
well understood. Therefore, identifying mucosal processes and/or mediators which modify HPV persistence vs
clearance and progression vs remission of cervical neoplasia could lead to new or improved treatments and
better CC outcomes for women.
 In this proposal we will investigate the contribution of the microbiome and mucosal immunity in the female
genital tract to health disparities in cervical cancer in African American women. This is built upon considerable
data from our lab and others that show that African American women have higher proportion of vaginal microbial
dysbiosis; that vaginal microbial dysbiosis is linked to pro-inflammatory and cancer pathways in cervical mucosa;
that these bacteria produce metabolites that are linked to an immunosuppressive phenotype; that dysbiotic
bacteria can induce cancer pathways in vitro; and cervical cancer tissue gene expression data from African
American women show increased activation inflammatory pathways compared to European American women.
In this concept we will utilize state-of-the-art systems biology techniques, including metagenomics,
metaproteomics, metabolomics, single cell RNA sequencing and flow cytometry to study vaginal mucosal biology
in prospective studies of African American women, coupled with functional studies in PV-associated cervical
cancer mouse models, to better understand these relationships."
10809012,"Optimizing Singlet Oxygen Dosimetry for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)
Abstract
The overall objective of this project is to optimize clinical singlet oxygen (1O2) dosimetry (SOD) via three
complementary and competing technologies: time-resolved singlet oxygen luminescence dosimetry (TSOLD),
multispectral singlet oxygen luminescence dosimetry (MSOLD), and singlet oxygen explicit dosimetry (SOED).
The TSOLD instrument is optical fiber-based and achieves ultralow noise detection via infrared time-correlated
single-photon counting. It can be used before and after PDT to measure cytotoxic 1O2 concentration ([1O2])
generation in tumor based on its 1270 nm luminescence emission, since it utilizes a short (ns) pulsed laser for
1O2 excitation that is independent of the PDT treatment laser. The recently developed MSOLD instrument
measures the luminescence spectrum of singlet oxygen excited by the treatment light, it is thus capable of
monitoring [1O2] during PDT without interfering with the treatment. However, unlike TSOLD, MSOLD may
introduce additional uncertainty in [1O2] due to a phosphorescence background orders of magnitude larger than
the singlet oxygen signal. The SOED instrument can be used in-vivo during PDT in real-time to measure reacted
1O2 generated by the treatment light based on explicit measurement of the light fluence rate, tissue oxygen
concentration, and photosensitizer concentration. The TSOLD or MSOLD signals will be used as an input to the
SOED system to make it more robust to account for the local oxygen microenvironment. Here, the immediate
clinical translation is to compare and determine the most suitable combination of the three technologies for SOD
by measurements at multiple sites in patients undergoing intrapleural PDT for malignant pleural mesothelioma,
which has shown significant potential in Photofrin-mediated clinical trials at UPenn. In addition, comparison will
be made in photosensitizer solutions, tissue-simulating phantoms, and tumors in vivo under well-controlled
conditions across a wide range of treatment conditions. Correlation of the tumor response with the1O2
measurements will be evaluated for three clinical photosensitizers (Photofrin, BPD, and ALA) in preclinical
models. The SOED instrument will be used at the same time and locations to calculate the “explicit” light-drug-
oxygen dose parameters as well as the tissue optical properties. The latter will be used to correct the measured
1O2 signal for light attenuation in order to calculate, the absolute concentration of the cytotoxic agent. The explicit
dose parameters will be used as inputs for SOED in an established macroscopic biophysical model to predict
the instantaneous and cumulative singlet oxygen concentration ([1O2]) for comparison with TSOLD and MSOLD
results, respectively. The outcome of this project will be the determination of the optimal combination
(TSOLD/MSOLD/SOED) for SOD in an ongoing PDT mesothelioma clinical trial under clinically-relevant
conditions. We hypothesize that quantitative SOD will be significantly more predictive of PDT efficacy than the
explicit or implicit (photobleaching-based) techniques used at present. Moreover, we hypothesize that the
optimized SOD system will give real-time feedback so that treatment can be personalized."
10809013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) have well-established risk factors such as physical activity (PA),
depression, and hypertension (HTN). These risk factors disproportionately affect racial minority populations, but the
mechanisms underlying racial health disparities are not well understood. In this, geographic factors could be key, as PA,
depression and HTN are strongly affected by geographic exposures, including green space. However, green space is
typically measured with questionnaires, which have substantial error, or satellite-based indexes that are nonspecific and
provide no information on the type of vegetation (e.g., tree vs. grass), nor whether the vegetation is within view at the street
level. As a result, no study has quantified the contribution of green space to racial disparities in ADRD. And while novel
technologies such as Google Street Views (GSV) imaging are promising data sources for capturing unique measures of
green space, managing, processing, and analyzing high-dimensional data present significant logistical and analytical
challenges, especially when linking these data to existing data from large prospective cohorts. Finally, we need to understand
green space in the context of other potentially correlated geographic exposures, or the urban exposome—the totality of life-
course geographic exposures (the set of green space, air pollutants, noise, built environment, and social environment)—to
estimate which factors drive health. This proposal will address these challenges by using GSV imaging to assess the effect
of green space on PA, depression, and HTN, as well as subsequent ADRD risk within the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA)—a 10-year longitudinal study of 6,814 men and women without clinical cardiovascular disease at
baseline from 4 racial/ethnic groups (Non-Hispanic White, African-American, Chinese, and Hispanic). Aim 1 will quantify
the effect of specific aspects of green space (e.g. trees, grass, shrubs, plants) on ADRD and cognitive decline and evaluate
whether these associations differ according to race/ethnicity. Aim 2 will determine the indirect effect of green space on
ADRD that is mediated through PA, depression, and HTN. Aim 3 will quantify exposome associations with ADRD and
cognitive decline using untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques and evaluate
whether they differ according to race/ethnicity. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the
applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in (1) implementing deep learning
algorithms to analyze high-resolution geographic data, (2) cognitive function epidemiology, and (3) developing and refining
data-driven approaches to perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies. These combined plans will successfully
prepare the applicant for an independent research career focused on identifying modifiable geographic determinants of
ADRD in diverse populations using innovative measures of geographic context."

I am an academic clinician scientist with a focus on the genetics of respiratory diseases. My overarching career
goal is to make an important contribution to the public health burden of chronic respiratory diseases. I aim to
become an independent investigator with the skill set to utilize integrative ‘omic techniques for the improved
biological understanding and clinical management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The
proposed research combines my prior experience in genetics and transcriptomics with training in genetic
association, transcriptomic analyses, and machine learning, in order to better understand the variability in
COPD genetic risk. The hypothesis of this proposal is that there are genetic variants and transcriptomic
factors that are associated with resilience to COPD. This will be tested by leveraging existing data from
multiple well-phenotyped studies from the NHLBI TransOmics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program.
Specific Aims: (1) Identify genetic variation associated with resilience to COPD against a background of
elevated genetic risk; (2) Define clinical, imaging, and blood gene-expression features of COPD
resilience; and (3) Predict lung-tissue gene-expression profiles of COPD risk and resilience from blood
gene-expression data. The cutting-edge research plan utilizes innovative methodologies to characterize
genetic and transcriptomic resilience to COPD. It is accompanied by a training plan that will provide me with
the skills to complete the research aims and the experience to transition to an independent research career. I
plan to submit an R01 expanding upon the characterization of genetic and transcriptomic resilience in COPD
by combining multi-omic risk- and resilience-scoring and lung-tissue gene-expression imputation to improve
understanding of the biological mechanisms that contribute to observed clinical heterogeneity in COPD. In
particular, I have four training goals that build upon my existing background in respiratory genetics. (1)
Strengthen my knowledge of biostatistics, statistical genomics, and bioinformatic methods; (2) Expand
my skills in transcriptomic methodologies; (3) Gain experience and expertise in the development and
implementation of machine-learning algorithms; and (4) Further develop my mentoring skills and
understanding of study design. I am supported by a mentoring team with complementary skillsets and
successful mentoring careers, which, together with my experience, training, and substantial preliminary data,
will guarantee the success of this proposal. The findings may pave the way for the development of precision
risk-prediction approaches, while implementing a novel methodology to address one of the most important
challenges in the field today: identification of genetic and transcriptomic resilience to COPD."
10806699,"Project Summary: This K01 application is designed to prepare the applicant to become a successful,
independent investigator combining state of the art neuroimaging methods and transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) to elucidate the neural circuits that underlie specific signs and symptoms of schizophrenia
(Sz), and using repetitive TMS as an intervention to attempt to normalize circuit function. To achieve this
career objective, I have worked with my mentoring/advisory committee to develop a plan to receive training in:
(1) TMS application, data analysis and how to design TMS studies, (2) clinical trial study design and
implementation, and (3) cognitive neuroscience including circuitry of specific cognitive domains and cognitive
impairment(s) in Sz. The short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is a biomarker of cortical excitability that
can be easily obtained with non-invasive paired-pulse TMS. Intracortical inhibition is consistently reduced in
prior studies of Sz (indicated by higher SICI scores in Sz). The overall goal of the proposed K01 research is to
evaluate the broader significance and clinical impact of reduced SICI in Sz, and evaluate whether repetitive
TMS can enhance SICI in Sz. The proposed research is important because it will help determine whether SICI
may serve as a meaningful target for future intervention studies and clinical trials. The specific aims are to: (1)
determine the specificity of relationships between SICI and different cognitive domains in Sz; (2) determine the
relationship between SICI and brain functional communication in Sz; and (3) perform a pilot mechanistic
repetitive TMS clinical trial targeting motor cortex of Sz patients to evaluate whether repetitive TMS can
enhance SICI in Sz. Aim 1 will combine use of paired-pulse TMS (to measure SICI) and in-depth cognitive
assessment to test the hypothesis that reduced inhibition (indexed by higher SICI score) in Sz will be
associated with poorer motor inhibition (Stop-Signal) task performance, and will generalize to spatial working
memory performance, which is thought to be sensitive to the same type of excitatory/inhibitory signaling
imbalance that is assayed by SICI. Aim 2 will combine use of paired-pulse TMS (to measure SICI) and resting
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test the hypothesis that reduced inhibition (indexed by higher
SICI score) in Sz is associated with lower resting connectivity between the anterior insula and both the motor
cortex and the dorsolateral-prefrontal cortex. Aim 3 will use inhibitory 1Hz repetitive TMS applied to motor
cortex of a sample of participants with Sz (N=17 active TMS, N=17 sham TMS) to evaluate whether five
sessions of active repetitive TMS can enhance SICI in Sz relative to sham stimulation. The proposed research
combines several quantitative approaches/assessments (cognitive assessment, fMRI, paired-pulse TMS, and
repetitive TMS) to better understand the underlying neurophysiology of Sz and its relationship to cognitive
impairments, with the translational aim of developing better treatments and innovative treatment targets for Sz."

Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW; ages 15-24) in sub-Saharan Africa face the dual threats of HIV

urgent need to reach AGYW with sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, health systems are often ill
equipped to overcome the numerous barriers to health care services faced by AGYW. The goal of the study is
to evaluate Malkia Klabu (“Queen Club”) in Tanzania, a loyalty program intervention that creates AGYW-
friendly drug shops where AGYW can access HIV prevention services and contraception. The motivation for
this approach is the growing recognition that drug shops, which are widely distributed and vastly outnumber
health facilities, can promote beneficial health behaviors, bridge gaps in health services, and mitigate health
workforce shortages. Furthermore, although HIV testing is the gateway to HIV prevention and care, self-testing
with oral fluid has not been widely adopted by AGYW, despite government adoptions across the Region.
Based on promising data from a pilot study, we hypothesize that the creation of a welcoming environment
through the Malkia Klabu intervention will attract AGYW and bolster uptake of SRH services, including HIV
self-test (HIVST) kits and contraception, thereby increasing the proportion of AGYW who are aware of their
HIV status and empowered to avoid unintended pregnancy. We have designed an innovative, mixed-methods
study to evaluate the Malkia Klabu intervention, which was designed for and by AGYW to create AGYW-friendly
drug shops where HIVST is available alongside contraception and linkages to care. Specifically, our 5-year study
includes a cluster-randomized trial (C-RCT) in 40 health facility catchment areas to evaluate the intervention’s
effectiveness on HIV diagnoses and antenatal care registrations among AGYW at the population level (Aim 1).
We will then link these outcomes to individual-level behaviors (e.g., recent HIV testing, unmet for
contraception, linkage to care) and other demand-side pathways leading to impact with a RDS survey and
focus groups with AGYW (Aim 2). Finally, a mixed-methods, implementation science study will pinpoint supply-
side factors influencing effectiveness (e.g., implementation models, intervention fidelity, shop characteristics;
Aim 3). At the study’s conclusion, we will have rigorously evaluated Malkia Klabu, uncovered factors that
enhance program success, and described potential pathways of impact, consistent with an implementation
science approach to close the gap between evidence and practice. The research team is a collaboration
between the University of California (San Francisco and Berkeley), Health for a Prosperous Nation, the
Tanzania Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and Children, and the Tanzania
Pharmacy Council.
The proposed study will rigorously explore, for the first time, whether AGYW-friendly drug shops can be used
to distribute HIV prevention and SRH services to AGYW and whether this community-based platform of
distribution is worthy of scaling to reach vulnerable AGYW across Tanzania and the Region."

The NIAID has named the development of a universal influenza vaccine as one if its key research
goals, and this need will not be met with traditional vaccine design. The design of a globally
protective vaccine against influenza has been hampered by the lack of a clear and definable
correlate of immunity against influenza. The current correlate of protection from influenza
infection, used to evaluate seasonal influenza vaccines, is the hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)
titer, an indirect measure of virus neutralization by antibodies. However, HAI incompletely
explains protection from seasonal influenza infection in humans. Conversely, extra-neutralizing
antibody-dependent innate immune effector functions, including antibody dependent cellular
cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody dependent phagocytosis (ADCP), and antibody dependent
complement activation (ADC), have all been implicated in protection in mice. However, it is
uncertain whether non-neutralizing functions contribute to protection in humans. Thus, here we
aim to exploit a comprehensive, agnostic, sample-sparing humoral profiling tool - that broadly
captures Fc-profile diversity at unprecedented depths - to define the extra-neutralizing profiles
of antibodies that track with protection against influenza in humans. Two unique cohorts of well
characterized vaccinees will be profiled to define correlates of protection and correlates of the
evolution of neutralizing antibody breadth. Linked to mechanistic dissection in mice, correlates
will be dissected to define mechanistic links to guide the development of next generation vaccine
strategies aimed at inducing functional-broadly neutralizing antibodies against influenza."
10795910,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tumor resistance to radiotherapy remains a critical barrier to improving outcomes for patients diagnosed with
locally advanced, unresectable cancers. Cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR) is governed by intracellular
and extracellular factors. To overcome tumor radioresistance, drugs that sensitize tumor cells to ionizing
radiation (IR) are used. Non-targeted cytotoxic chemotherapies given concurrently with radiotherapy have
demonstrated improved tumor control and overall survival in cancer patients. However, since this paradigm
shifting approach occurred in the 1980's there has been a shocking lack of progress in developing molecularly
targeted radiosensitization approaches. Improving the therapeutic ratio of IR in combination with systemically
delivered drugs can be achieved by two general approaches, 1) using drugs that block DNA damage repair
responses 2) delivering radiosensitizing drugs selectively to tumors. These two methods are orthogonal
techniques to achieve the same end goal of increasing IR induced tumor kill while reducing normal tissue
toxicities. To address both of these fundamental cancer therapy problems, we have focused on target
discovery and tumor selective drug delivery vehicles. With regards to target discovery, our recent studies on
non-canonical CRAF functions led to our discovery of an unexpected role for PAK in DNA damage repair and
sensitivity to IR. PAK is comprised of a family of six kinases subdivided in Group I and II. Importantly, PAK are
involved in process central to oncogenesis, tumor aggressiveness and patient survival. To tackle tumor
selective drug delivery, we are developing drug conjugated activatable cell penetrating peptides (ACPP) to
selectively deliver potent radiosensitizers to tumors based on extracellular tumor protease activity. ACPP
consist of a drug conjugated polycationic cell penetrating peptide and an autoinhibitory polyanionic peptide
separated from each other by a flexible peptide linker. This peptide linker is specifically cleaved by proteases
enriched in the extracellular tumor microenvironment. While ACPP is intact, the drug conjugated cell
penetrating peptide is neutralized (i.e. held in a “pro-drug” state) by the polyanionic peptide so that the drug
cannot gain access to its intracellular target. Tumor microenvironment proteases cleave ACPP and release the
drug conjugated cell penetrating peptide, which is then taken up by tumor cells. The goals of our proposal are
to gain insight into how PAK governs radioresistance and then therapeutically exploit this with targeted PAK
inhibitors. In Aim 1, we will genetically determine the mechanisms through which Group I and II PAKs govern
IR resistance. In Aim 2, we will pharmacologically test the ability to radiosensitize tumors with small molecule
PAK inhibitors. In Aim 3, we will test if tumor targeted ACPP increase the therapeutic ratio of conjugated PAK
inhibitors. Our approach has complementary innovations in both DNA damage target discovery and tumor
selective drug delivery. Combining these approaches will lay a foundation for moving away from non-targeted
cytotoxic radiosensitization to biomarker driven molecularly guided radiosensitization."

Treatment services for HIV and OUD have historically been delivered across multiple settings
leading to fragmented and uncoordinated care. Models of behavior change suggest that
addressing multiple health conditions simultaneously through integrated, evidence-based,
interventions has the potential to overcome traditional barriers to optimize engagement and
improve clinical outcomes. Consistent with this perspective, numerous studies have
documented that receipt of opioid agonist treatment, in the context of HIV care, is associated
with ART adherence and decreased HIV viral loads. Recent pharmacological advancements
have led to the development of novel long-acting, injectable, (LAI) medications for both HIV
(cabotegravir co-administered with rilpivirine) and OUD (extended-release buprenorphine).
These therapies have the potential to dramatically improve adherence by eliminating the need
for daily pill-taking. Despite the extensive evidence base supporting LAI for both HIV and OUD,
and clinical guidelines supporting integrated care provision, currently little is known about 1) the
perceived acceptability/feasibility/safety of combining HIV and OUD treatment into a single point
of care; b) which populations and within which type of settings these medications may be
optimally delivered; and c) what factors may impede or facilitate future implementation of these
treatments. Therefore, the goal of the proposed application is to advance integrated treatment
for HIV and OUD by conducting formative research with the target population and key
stakeholders to develop a clinical protocol to guide the delivery of combined LAI treatment;
evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of this integrated delivery model; and assess
factors to optimize the potential for scalability. The study will be accomplished through two
primary aims: (1) Develop a clinical protocol to guide the delivery of combined LAI for HIV and
OUD by conducting in-depth interviews with prospective patients, clinical content experts, and
other key stakeholders. (2) Conduct an open pilot test of the proposed clinical protocol to
assess feasibility, acceptability, and safety among patients diagnosed with HIV and OUD.
Throughout all phases of the study, we will simultaneously collect information on patient-,
provider-, and organizational-level variables to inform future implementation. Findings from this
study will be used to develop a R01 application to conduct a fully-powered Hybrid Type 1
Effectiveness-Implementation study design."
10795863,"The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is a validated target for cancer therapeutics involved
in the DNA-damage response (DDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) double strand break (DSB)
repair pathways. Various anti-cancer therapeutic strategies, including ionizing radiation (IR) impart their
efficacy by inducing DNA DSBs. Both genetic and pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that modulating
the DDR and DSB repair pathways has a profound impact on the efficacy of DNA damaging therapeutic agents
supporting the premise of targeting DNA-PK in cancer therapy. Development of DNA-PK inhibitors thus far has
focused entirely on targeting the DNA-PKcs active site, three of which are currently in early phase clinical trials.
We have exploited the requirement for DNA-PK activation of binding to DNA termini via the Ku 70/80
heterodimer to identify small molecule Ku inhibitors that inhibit DNA-PK via a novel mechanism. Preliminary
data show that Ku-inhibitors abrogate DNA-PK catalytic activity at nanomolar concentrations and potentiate
cellular sensitivity to DSB-inducing therapeutics. We have also proven that the observed cellular effects are a
function of direct on-target Ku inhibition. Based on the rigorous published and preliminary data we
hypothesize that DNA-PK inhibition mediated by targeting Ku-DNA binding, will inhibit the DDR and
NHEJ pathways resulting in sensitization of cancer cells to DNA damaging anti-cancer agents. To
address this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1 we will develop highly potent and selective
DNA-PK inhibitors by targeting the Ku-DNA interaction. Having established nanomolar inhibitors, chemistry
efforts will focus on optimizing the physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties to increase cellular uptake
and bioavailability while retaining excellent potency and selectivity. In Aim 2 we will determine the molecular
mechanism of action (MOA) of Ku inhibitors and elucidate how chemical inhibition of Ku impacts the cellular
DDR and repair pathways. In Aim 3 we will interrogate how modulation of DSB repair via HRR and DDR
signaling due to Ku inhibition impacts anticancer efficacy alone and in combination therapy in clinically relevant
models of lung and ovarian cancer. We will also assess the impact of common cancer genetic mutations in
genome stability and maintenance pathways (including BRCA1 and BRCA2) towards exploiting synthetic lethal
interactions to enhance drug and radiation efficacy. Completion of these studies will provide essential
information for the continued discovery and development of novel Ku-targeted DNA-PK inhibitors. The impact
of this research thus extends beyond the generation of new knowledge, reagents and models to provide new
molecularly targeted treatment options for a wide array of cancers that are currently difficult to treat effectively."
10795864,"ABSTRACT
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a family of neurodegenerative syndromes characterized by progressive
decline in emotion, social behavior, and language. The behavioral variant of FTD is the most common clinical
subtype and is characterized by deficits in emotion, empathy, and social behavior. FTD is often sporadic but
can be caused by genetic mutations in C9orf72, GRN, and MAPT. Genetic forms of FTD offer a critical window
into the disease's early stages because individuals with genetic mutations can be identified, studied, and
followed when they are asymptomatic and as they enter the symptomatic stage of the disease. Our previous
laboratory-based studies have found alterations in autonomic nervous system activity, facial expression, and
experience occur early in FTD and reflect dysfunction in specific brain networks. Anatomically specific emotion
biomarkers could be used to monitor symptom progression or treatment response in clinical trials of
asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals, but more scalable approaches are needed. The proposed
project will build on our prior laboratory-based studies of emotion in asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals
with FTD and will include longitudinal, multi-day assessments of emotion and behavior in the real world. These
data will allow us to test whether novel emotion biomarkers we have discovered in the laboratory can be
tracked with remote tools and will enable us to determine whether there are additional areas of change in early
FTD that have previously gone undetected. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that emotions are direct
readouts of vulnerable brain systems that can be used to monitor progression in the asymptomatic and early
symptomatic phase of FTD. We will conduct laboratory-based assessments of emotion in 100 mutation carriers
across the clinical spectrum, 50 mutation non-carrier family member controls, 50 people with sporadic
behavioral variant FTD, and 50 older healthy controls at three annual research visits that include a clinical
work-up and neuroimaging. We will also conduct five biannual remote assessments of emotion during which
we will measure real-world autonomic physiology (with wearable devices), behavior (with participants'
photographs and self-reported activities), and subjective feelings (with experience sampling methods). We will
address three key aims. In Aim 1, we will map the real-world landscape of emotion in asymptomatic mutation
carriers and early FTD and its associations with laboratory measures of emotion and affective symptoms. In
Aim 2, we will isolate the neural systems underlying FTD-relevant aberrations in emotion as measured in the
real world and laboratory. In Aim 3, we will quantify longitudinal emotion system decline in early FTD. By
integrating neuroimaging techniques with measures of emotion from the laboratory and the real world, this
project has the potential to advance current models of the biological basis of emotion dysfunction and decline
in early FTD."
10795958,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candidate background: I received my PhD from the University of Montreal (Canada) with a dissertation on
pulmonary responses induced by inhaled TiO2 nanoparticles. This research provided me with a solid expertise
in lung biology and inhalation toxicology. During my post-doctorate at Louisiana State University (LSU) under
the supervision of Dr. Arthur Penn, I received high quality training in tobacco science, including on second-hand
smoke and electronic-cigarettes (e-cigs). I am currently an Assistant Professor at LSU, with a research program
that focuses on electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and their pulmonary health effects.
Career goals and objectives: My long-term career goals are to become a well-funded independent scientist in
the fields of tobacco regulatory science, as well as to attain a tenured Professorship in a research-intensive
academic institution. My research goals are to enhance our understanding of the impact of e-cig and JUUL
aerosol exposures on lung development and on cardiopulmonary responses. This mentored award will support
my career goals by providing protected time to learn new techniques and expertise from my mentoring team.
Career development and training activities: I plan to use this mentored award to gain expertise in lung
immunology and cardiovascular effects caused by exposures to tobacco-related products to complement my
expertise in tobacco-related pulmonary effects. This will be supported by my mentoring team. Dr. Stephania
Cormier will be my primary mentor in flow cytometry and lung immunity. Dr. Kent Pinkerton’s mentoring will allow
me to expand from solely pulmonary assessment to cardiovascular evaluations of effects induced by ENDS. Dr.
Tammy Dugas will be my primary mentor in assessing vascular function in mouse models following exposures
to ENDS aerosols. I will also complete a bioinformatics course, attend seminars and present at conferences.
Research strategy – Summary: The prevalence of ENDS use in the US is 8 million adults, of whom 70% are
dual-users of classic cigarettes and e-cigs. Little is known regarding the cardiopulmonary effects due to chronic
inhalation of ENDS aerosols. Clinical evidence demonstrates declines in lung function and increases in risks of
myocardial infarction in healthy dual-users. Since biomarkers of harm with predictive value for cardiopulmonary
diseases in dual-users exist, we hypothesize that these biomarkers can serve as a basis for the evaluation of
cardiopulmonary toxicity related to long-term inhalation exposures to e-cig or JUUL in single-users. We will study
how two ENDS products of different design -- 1) open system e-cig devices, and 2) closed system JUUL devices
-- impact individual or combinations of the constituents found in these aerosols, and their toxicity. Our goals are
A) to examine the roles that e-liquid constituents play in the chemical profile and in vitro toxicity of ENDS
aerosols; and B) to define a panel of biomarkers for cardiopulmonary effects following exposures to either dual-
use of cigarettes and e-cigs, or sole exposures to e-cig or JUUL aerosols using in vivo models. Thus, this study
has a high societal impact since it will help inform the regulatory agencies and the 8 million adults ENDS users."
10793037,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating neurological condition that impacts an estimated 250,000 individuals in the United States. Deficits in locomotion strongly contribute to post-SCI disability, and there are limited therapies to restore walking. The development of consistent, effective interventions to promote recovery of gait in individuals with SCI is of clear importance. It is widely recognized that approaches that facilitate synaptic plasticity in conjunction with rehabilitation hold promise to guide adaptive changes and improve recovery after incomplete SCI. We have developed one such strategy that uses electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck to drive precisely-timed release of neuromodulators. Coupling vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) with rehabilitation enhances synaptic plasticity and significantly improves recovery in multiple preclinical models of SCI. Moreover, a pivotal study demonstrates that VNS paired with upper limb rehabilitation promotes recovery of arm and hand function after chronic stroke, and promising preliminary clinical data indicates similar improvements in individuals with incomplete cervical SCI. Here, we seek to build on this success and translate a VNS therapy to restore gait after SCI. VNS therapy is based on coincident stimulation during specific rehabilitative exercises, thus the goal of UG3 phase of the proposed project is to finalize a system for closed-loop VNS triggering during lower limb rehabilitation. We will integrate an array of lower limb sensors with our VNS system and perform testing to ensure performance to relevant standards. Additionally, we will gain the necessary regulatory approvals for a subsequent study. Finally, we will perform a pilot study of this approach in individuals with SCI previously implanted with a VNS device as part of a separate study. In the UH3 phase of this project, we will perform a randomized, double-blinded, sham- controlled study to evaluate the utility of this strategy to improve recovery of gait in individuals with chronic incomplete SCI. Our team is seriously committed to clinical translation and has successfully performed multiple clinical trials using VNS paired with rehabilitation. Collectively, these aims represent an expeditious approach that balances the challenge of translation with achievable goals necessary for effective clinical investigation. Successful completion of these Aims will directly lead to a performance of a subsequent pivotal trial of this potential therapy in individuals with chronic SCI."

Genetic diseases such as tooth agenesis, dentinogenesis imperfecta, infectious diseases such as caries or
fractures represent common public health problems that affect up to 30-40% of the population worldwide and
impose significant burdens on patients (Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, 2019). The estimated
direct costs of dental diseases amounted to $356.80 billion, totaling worldwide costs due to dental diseases of
$544.41 billion in 2015. Given the unabated rise of dental diseases prevalence in the general population, it can
only be expected that the number and cost will intensify in the future.
As tooth regeneration remains elusive, restoring function and esthetics is lengthy and expensive. Current efforts
in the field of regenerative dentistry rely on the availability of methods that inject into tissues in vitro expanded
heterogeneous multipotent stem cell populations or in vitro differentiated progeny of pluripotent cell lines. Due to
insufficient characterization of the molecular signature of progenitor cell sources as to their capacity to generate
functional differentiated cell progeny, these efforts lead to insufficient numbers of cells available for building new
tissues. Thus, identifying the cellular and molecular identity of genes and pathways that reliably prompt cells to
differentiate into one cell type and not another for instance would fulfil a major gap in our knowledge to reliably
develop strategies for recreating these processes in stem cell therapies. The goal of this project is to identify
the cellular and molecular identity of genes and pathways defining dental mesenchymal cell differentiation and
fate early in tooth development and harness this information to develop potential therapeutics mainly for dentin
regeneration."
10796832,"Risks for developing cardiovascular‐based and Alzheimer’s neurodegeneration (ND) are strongly connected to
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms. There are three ApoE variants with differential impacts on ND risk, where
variant 2 reduces and 4 increases risk relative to variant 3. These ApoE variants also impact cognition and memory in
young healthy individuals, presumably through ApoE’s (primary) lipid transport function. Thus, a leading hypothesis is
that the transport of lipids creates a metabolic bias in healthy subjects that sensitizes (or protects) the brains of these
subjects to physiological stresses which leads to ND. In support of this hypothesis, lifestyle choices including exercise and
diet, which shift metabolic patterns, modify the risk of ND as much as genetic predisposition. The interplay of genetic
and environmental risk factors indicate that the preexisting metabolic condition of the brain is a key initiating variable,
and that interceding in this metabolic bias represents a viable method for preventing disease. Unanswered questions,
however, include which metabolic pathways are most impacted by the ApoE polymorphism, and how does age
exaggerate the metabolic condition to promote ND. Modified lipid metabolism is a unifying variable between long‐term inflammation, reduced cellular repair and modified energy availability which all promote ND. We have developed methods to monitor the turnover of lipids and proteins in vivo. Coupling this with mass spectrometric (MS) imaging, we can see spatially distinct in vivo metabolic regulation across the brain. A systems‐level investigation, in which the fluxes of many lipids and proteins are simultaneously measured, may be the most sensitive approach to monitor ApoE‐dependent changes in regulation of metabolic networks. It is probable that the ApoE isoforms bias lipid delivery to different regions of the brain. This bias creates regional long‐term shifts in metabolism, which change the risk for damage due to stress. Comparison of changes in brain metabolism between ApoE2, ApoE3, or E4 mouse models and the age‐dependent changes for each genotype will help to identify metabolic patterns that protect the brain from accumulation of damage.
The overall objective of this proposal is to monitor regional changes in metabolic pathway control and identify how ApoE
shifts metabolic flux. The central hypothesis is that ApoE2 biases metabolism to a pattern that protects metabolic
control or regulation, while ApoE4 biases lipid metabolism in the opposite direction resulting in more rapid age‐related
loss of metabolic control."

I propose a 5-year mentored research training program to become a leader in the field of pediatric sleep
research. I am residency-trained in Child Neurology, and dual fellowship-trained in Pediatric Neurocritical Care,
and Clinical Neurophysiology. I am currently Assistant Professor of Child Neurology at Oregon Health and
Science University. This proposal focuses specifically on understanding the role of sleep as a mediator of
recovery in youth with mild TBI (mTBI), and the biological mechanisms underlying this mediator effect. My
career plan will provide me advanced quantitative skills in biostatistical modeling and longitudinal analysis, use
of actigraphy in sleep research, and advanced imaging processing. The training will come through formal
coursework, mentored research, experiential learning, and scientific meetings.
The overall objective of this proposal is to establish the mechanisms linking sleep-wake disturbances
(SWD), glymphatic pathway disturbances, and persistent post-concussive symptoms in youth with
mTBI. Every year, millions of youth are affected by mTBI. Post-concussive symptoms include headaches,
fatigue, irritability, confusion, forgetfulness, and mood problems. Sleep problems are also a common complaint
in this population. Patients with mTBI and subjective sleep problems report more prolonged post-concussive
symptoms. However, despite this knowledge, several questions remain: 1) In youth with acute mTBI, to what
extent do sleep disturbances play a mediating role in the persistence of post-concussive symptoms? 2) What
are the biological mechanisms underlying this mediator effect? In order to answer these questions, I have
decided to study the glymphatic pathway, a network of perivascular spaces that supports the clearance of
interstitial solutes and wastes from the brain during sleep. Recently, the presence of enlarged perivascular
spaces (ePVS) seen on brain MRI has been proposed as a noninvasive marker of glymphatic pathway
dysfunction. Our preliminary data and findings from other investigators suggest that enlarged ePVS are seen in
patients with mTBI, particularly in those with sleep disturbances. We will take advantage of novel technology
developed at OHSU to measure ePVS in a cohort of youth with mTBI. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that glymphatic pathway dysfunction resulting from SWD drives the development and
persistence of post-concussive symptoms. To test this hypothesis we will 1) Define the role of SWD as a
mediator of persistent post-concussive symptoms in youth with mTBI; 2) Determine the combined effect of
mTBI and SWD on ePVS burden in youth and the relationship between ePVS burden and persistent post-
concussive symptoms. This research will help understand how sleep affects recovery after mTBI, and the
mechanisms underlying this mediator effect. Data generated through this work will allow the design of larger
longitudinal studies aimed at defining the long-term effects of SWD on outcomes after mTBI. It will also
encourage the exploration of novel mechanisms affecting recovery in animal models of TBI."

Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), has played a major role in developing novel approaches for risk stratification,
molecular testing, and treatment of lung cancer. This group has also been responsible for guiding the
development of biomarker-driven clinical trials initiated by the ECOG-ACRIN Thoracic Malignancies Committee.
Our highly collaborative team approach includes sharing specimens across institutions, conducting pilot projects
that are of direct relevance to NCTN trials and guiding the translational research components of all newly
developed ECOG-ACRIN thoracic malignancies trials. Our overarching goal is to develop novel biomarkers to
enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy, overcome resistance to targeted agents and to identify combination
treatment approaches to enhance the efficacy of existing therapies in lung cancer within the context of the NCTN.
With this application, we propose to continue our research work with direct relevance to the NCTN, with the
following specific aims: 1) To develop genomic, epigenomic, and proteomics approaches to enhance biomarker
discovery efforts in ongoing and planned ECOG-ACRIN studies; 2) To conduct pilot studies on existing ECOG-
ACRIN and institutional lung cancer tumor specimens that will lead to prospective NCTN clinical trials; and 3) To
guide the development of translational research components of ECOG-ACRIN Thoracic trials and promote
collaborations with lung cancer SPORE and P01 institutions. The EA-ITSC will have a robust pilot projects

The master’s program in Bioethics in Research aims to develop knowledge and skills for
understanding and analyzing the ethical aspects of health sciences, biomedical sciences, and
health management, contributing to the individual and collective resolution of relevant ethical
problems, and to the training of educators on these matters.
 Recognizing the existing needs in Latin America for professionals with multidisciplinary
knowledge in bioethics in research, this master's program will emphasize the development of
pedagogical competences that allow our graduates to become trainers and solve ethical
problems that frequently emerge from conflicts between the socioeconomic conditions of the
region and the priority of improving public health.
 To this end, the master’s program focuses on the development of the necessary skills for
ethical management of health care, research, as well as public health management ensuring the
protection of fundamental rights for all research participants. At the same time, students will
develop skills to guide, carry out, and communicate bioethical research from a multidisciplinary
perspective.
 Our graduates will be prepared to work in health institutions, universities, pharmaceutical
laboratories, research centers, IRBs, government agencies, and other related institutions, in
which ethical health challenges must be addressed, always aiming for the integral well-being of
citizens. We aim for our graduates to become multipliers of bioethics in research expertise,
which is nowadays in high demand in the region, as many Latin American countries move
towards the creation, implementation, and regulation of IRBs. Our goal is to make a significant

10798280,"Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emergent, highly transmissible, geographically expanding, prion 
disease of both wild and captive cervids. CWD is unique among prion diseases in its facile contagion and 
environmental persistence. Its expanding geographical range, combined with the increasing transport of 
animals and animal products, portend its continued expansion and diversification. The zoonotic potential of 
CWD remains poorly understood. CWD endemic areas interface cervids with livestock species and humans, 
posing obvious zoonotic risks that over time will increase. While it is known that strains of CWD exist, nothing
is known about the zoonotic potential of these strains. Work from our applicant group has shown that CWD infected cervids continually shed prions into the environment and that previously unrecognized environmental 
factors can influence the emergence of a dominant strain from a mixture. The ability to recognize the zoonotic 
potential of CWD strains is central to mitigating CWD transmission risk. The central hypothesis for work 
described here is that CWD strains evolve continuously due to a combination of both host and environmental 
factors. We will test this hypothesis by: i) determining the evolution and zoonotic impact of CWD strains in the
native cervid species; ii) leveraging our unique animal resources, expertise, and in vivo & in vitro
methodologies to assess environmental factors that alter CWD strain selection and evolution and iii) evaluate 
zoonotic potential of CWD strains by a complementary combination of in vitro amplification assays and 
animal transmission studies. The results will provide new information about this emergent transmissible prion 
disease and the risk it poses to humans and other species."
10795128,"Modern drug analysis techniques are an integral part of research and healthcare today. Regrettably,
the current approach for sample collection consists of literally removing “a piece of the patient or experimental
animal” (whether it is a blood sample or a tissue biopsy) that is sent to the laboratory for analysis. Such a
procedure poses ethical issues, health risks for the medical personnel, and inconvenience for the investigated
being (patient or lab animal). Furthermore, although it has been recognized that tissue concentrations are
more predictive of clinical outcome than plasma concentrations, the assessment of drug distribution and
target site pharmacokinetics is very difficult because of lack of appropriate methodology. Point-of-care
devices for measuring electrolytes, cardiac markers, and several small molecules now reside in emergency
rooms and even at patient bedsides - but there are no clinical devices for fast monitoring of drug levels in
body fluids and tissues. The need for such devices is even greater for difficult to treat diseases such as
neoplasms.
 In response to the current challenges faced by drug analysis for pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
and therapeutic drug monitoring, we are proposing to apply innovative microsampling approaches to measure
therapeutic antibody concentrations in the tumors without collecting a physical sample from the investigated
organism. These methods feature reliable calibration, freedom from pumps, no osmotic effects, and
significant improvements in sensitivity. Furthermore, they are faster and more economical than classical
ones.
 The new methods will be applied for the first time to measure the tumor concentration of immune
checkpoint inhibitors that act by blocking the programmed cell death receptors on T cells.
 The proposed research will utilize biocompatible sampling devices for direct microextraction of
antibody drugs from tumors. These devices will be prepared by covering flexible medical-grade metal wires
with biocompatible polymers and high affinity extractive phases. The extracted analytes will be quantified
by chromatography and mass spectrometry to offer high specificity and low limits of detection.
 For quantitation, several calibration methods will be applied, such as external standard, diffusion-based
calibration, and kinetic calibration. The data will be used to build a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model
for a representative therapeutic antibody, such as pembrolizumab.
 The new in vivo sampling method will be validated by comparison with large pore microdialysis. It is
expected that microextraction will provide better sensitivity, accuracy, less tissue damage (due to smaller size),
portability, and convenience (no pumps and fluids)."

training. High load/intensity, due to high mechanical stress, can be burdensome, unfeasible, and lead to a
greater risk of injuries/pain for many seniors. Pain and injury are common barriers to exercise participation in
older adults. Interestingly, lifting lighter loads to muscular failure (or inability to perform another repetition) is
as effective as high loads in increasing muscle growth and strength in younger adults. However, there is a gap
in knowledge about the efficacy of lifting lighter weights to fatigue on muscle mass, strength, and function in
older adults. Our long-term goal is to develop less challenging but effective ST interventions, thus improving
strength training participation in aging adults. The overall objective of the current study is to evaluate the
efficacy of lifting lighter loads to near to failure on strength training adaptations and function in older adults.
Based on our pilot data results, our central hypothesis is that ST with lighter loads close to failure is not inferior
to higher loads for increasing muscle mass, strength, power, and function in older adults. Although promising,
a large, long-term, randomized controlled trial (RCT) is necessary to demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of
lifting lighter loads close to failure.
 We will conduct a single-blind RCT in 66 community-living sedentary older men and women (≥ 70
years) to compare a light load, high repetition (LLHR) ST program (20-24 repetitions) taken near to failure to a
conventional high load, lower repetition ST program (8-12 repetitions) with the following aims: 1) To assess the
efficacy of light load, high repetition (LLHR) program on changes in physical function in older adults. 2) To
assess the efficacy of the LLHR program on changes in lean body mass, power, and strength in older adults. 3)
To assess engagement and affective responses of the LLHR program. The application is innovative in that it
seeks to a novel, pragmatic approach to resistance training in older adults that can produce benefits and also
be more sustainable than conventional approaches. The application is significant since if the above hypotheses
are supported, the LLHR program can improve ST participation by providing a more accessible and less
challenging alternative for older adults. In addition, the application will provide valuable training in recruitment,
training, testing, and data analysis to Queens College students and prepare them for careers in the sciences.
Considering that there are now more Americans ages 65 and older, and numbers steadily increasing, the LLHR
program is timely and has the potential to make a substantial contribution to public health by enhancing
function and independence in aging adults."
10818174,"Non-genetic acquired resistance has been implicated in the therapy failure of multiple cancer types. Therefore,
there have been significant efforts to uncover the mechanisms regulating such drug-resistant cellular states
and how these states may be perturbed to promote cancer cell death and curb disease progression. While
there has been much progress in understanding and characterizing drug-induced cellular states, little is known
about what controls the inheritance of these states by daughter cells. Understanding the heritability of
drug-induced states is not only useful to determine dosing frequency but also is critical in designing effective
combination treatment regimens. Existing approaches to characterize cell state inheritance fall short of this
goal because the features needed to define cell states are inaccessible, the temporal windows needed to
observe state transitions are exceedingly long, and the cellular throughput needed to robustly read out effects
of systematic perturbation is prohibitively high. Here, we propose inheritance-Seq, a new method that enables
quantification of cell state heritability to meet the need for an approach to understand the heritability of
drug-induced states. Inheritance-Seq combines CRISPR-based genetic lineage tracing and phenotyping with
microscopy and in situ sequencing (ISS) to enable scalable measurement of phenotype inheritance with
systematic pooled genetic perturbations to explore the mechanisms of phenotypic trait inheritance in cells. In
the proposed work, we will design and implement a general framework to quantify the heritability of cell states
and validate the performance of inheritance-Seq by identifying known factors regulating the inheritance of
drug-induced metabolic state changes in OVCAR8 cells following carboplatin treatment."
10820497,"Project Summary/Abstract
Significant work demonstrates the influence of spouses on one another’s emotions, behaviors, and health-
related outcomes. What is not understood is the role partners play in cognitive development, change, and
adaptation in middle and later life. Because researchers have not identified the biobehavioral mechanisms and
processes that couples employ as they navigate normative and non-normative (i.e., mild cognitive impairment,
dementia) cognitive aging, development of effective behavioral interventions to maintain and bolster
performance is impeded. Prospective memory (PM), or memory for future actions, is essential to health and
safety (e.g., remembering to take medication or turn off a stove) and ultimately, the ability to age in place. To
remain in their homes, older adults must maintain this critical memory skill. The proposed research will identify
behaviors of middle-aged and older adults when they collaborate on PM tasks and determine how those
behaviors and the accompanying stress response affect PM. The central hypothesis underlying this research is
that significant others are inherently involved in daily memory tasks and exert substantial “partner” effects,
which positively (e.g., compensation) and/or negatively (e.g., retrieval interference, increased stress) influence
PM outcomes. To test the hypothesis, this research addresses four specific aims: 1) Determine the effects of
individual and dyadic characteristics on collaborative PM performance in laboratory and real-world contexts, 2)
Investigate social and cognitive behaviors exhibited during the collaborative process to determine the impact of
dyadic behaviors on PM performance, 3) Identify the concomitant effects of partners’ stress responses and
ability on collaborative PM performance, and 4) Investigate biobehavioral processes and corresponding
performance within a clinical subsample of dyads for whom one partner has MCI or early-stage dementia. The
research is significant because it systematically examines the commonplace (but unstudied) phenomenon of
partner interactions to identify the socio-cognitive and physiological processes important to PM and how these
biobehavioral pathways may differ for couples experiencing non-normative cognitive change. The work is
innovative because it includes measurement of dyadic attunement and incorporates investigation of spouses
who experience cognitive change at different rates and thus are faced with the need to compensate for a
partner who is struggling with the cognitive tasks of daily life. The proposed research is essential to achieving
our goal of developing behaviorally-based interventions to enhance critical everyday memory behaviors and
promote independent living."

Screening with low-dose CT (LDCT) scans reduces lung cancer mortality. However, the potential harms
associated with screening include false-negative and false-positive results, incidental findings, overdiagnosis,
radiation exposure, and complications from invasive diagnostic procedures and treatments. Given the complexity
of lung cancer screening (LCS) decisions, the United States Preventive Services Task Force strongly
recommends that patients receive counseling about smoking cessation and shared decision-making (SDM) with
a health care provider before being referred for LDCT. The SDM discussion about LCS should address the
benefits and harms of screening, the importance of adhering to annual lung cancer LDCT screening and
recommended diagnostic testing and treatment, and tobacco avoidance. Yet, there is uncertainty about how to
most effectively engage patients in SDM for LCS. Both patients and primary care clinicians perceive important
barriers to LCS decision making and accessing health service. When screening discussions are conducted, they
often fail to meet expectations for SDM. We propose to address these deficiencies by implementing a workflow
aware telemedicine SDM intervention that includes decision coaching and patient navigation that is a potentially
scalable and efficient approach to meeting national screening recommendations. The study’s long-term goal is
to reduce disparities and the burden of lung cancer among heavy smokers by supporting high-quality decision
making about LCS and smoking cessation and abstinence. Our short-term goal is to identify an effective
intervention that can readily be implemented in real-world primary care settings to support high-quality SDM in
racially and ethnically diverse populations. We will conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid type I trial
guided by the Practical, Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM). A cluster randomized trial
design including 40 primary care practices, 100 providers and 400 patients will evaluate whether a telemedicine
decision coaching and navigation intervention (TELESCOPE) compared to enhanced usual care (EUC) will
improve the quality of decision making, increase adherence with screening and diagnostic testing, and generate
more referrals for smoking cessation. The specific aims are to: 1) Test the effectiveness of a decision coaching
intervention for LCS delivered by nurse navigators vs. EUC on the quality of patient decision making about LCS,
subsequent screening and diagnostic testing, and smoking cessation referrals for current smokers; 2)
Evaluate
the implementation potential of navigator-led decision coaching for LCS; and 3) Determine the resources and
costs required to implement the navigator-led decision coaching intervention for LCS. This highly impactful
research has the potential to greatly advance the field of SDM implementation and improve quality of care by
providing patients with high-quality decision support about LCS, testing feasible strategies for busy PCPs to
support SDM for their high-risk patients, and demonstrating for policy makers and payors new models for
effective delivery of SDM for LCS."
10817865,"Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) affects an estimated 2–5% of young school age children in the U.S., with an estimated cost of $1.4 million per individual. Two cardinal outcomes of FASD are fetal growth restriction and neurodevelopmental deficits. Efforts to successfully prevent or ameliorate these teratogenic effects of alcohol abuse have been impeded by a limited understanding of alcohol’s complex mechanisms of action, which impact multiple organ systems. In addition, etiological reports on FASD outcomes have been mostly limited to investigating indirect downstream mediators.  We propose the molecular pathway governing phosphatidylethanol (PEth; 100% specific, most sensitive biomarker for gestational alcohol exposure) formation can yield novel insights into FASD etiology, as
during alcohol metabolism, phosphatidylcholine is hydrolyzed to PEth instead of phosphatidic acid (PA, an essential nutrient for growth/neuron development). In an established FASD model, our novel preliminary data shows alcohol decreases PA bioavailability and concurrently increases PEth levels in maternal and fetal compartments. Our data also show alcohol-induced impairment of maternal uterine artery (related to fetal growth) and fetal brain vascular (related to neurodevelopmental outcomes) adaptations. Interestingly, PA addition in vitro to the uterine and middle cerebral arteries reverses alcohol-induced dysfunction in these vessels, and in vivo PA administration reverses FASD growth deficit. Our data also identify a role for endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and mTORC1 signaling in this alcohol/PEth/PA framework. In Aim #1, we hypothesize that in our FASD model, PA plays a major role in alcohol-mediated vasodilatory deficits and the related eNOS pathway in maternal uterine and developing cranially directed arteries, and that alcohol impairs the NO system via PA-mediated mTORC1 system alteration. Following mechanistic in vitro blockade of PA, mTORC1, and related signaling, we will assess uterine and developing cranially directed
arterial adaptations using arteriography, LC-MS/MS, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, RNA-seq, RT-PCR, and patch clamp. In Aim#2, we hypothesize PA administration in vivo reverses alcohol-induced decreases in uterine artery and fetal cranially directed blood flow, and improves fetal nutrient delivery, growth phenotypes, and deficits in alcohol-sensitive neurobiological outcomes. We will measure growth indices, uterine blood flow, uterine O2/nutrient delivery, fetal cranially directed blood flow, and neuronal function/morphology to assess the role of PA in the etiology of two cardinal FASD outcomes.  We anticipate that the proposed experiments will provide a much-needed breakthrough in the FASD field by identifying a promising etiological molecular pathway(s) for FASD growth and/or neurodevelopmental
deficits. These studies will pave way for future novel prevention/treatment studies strategically aimed at rescuing FASD cardinal outcome phenotypes through manipulation of direct alcohol targets."
10817867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There are ~1,500 patients in the United States with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD;
MIM 173900), a hepatorenal fibrocystic disorder characterized by enlarged kidneys with innumerable collecting
duct cysts and progressive loss of renal function. Essentially all cases of ARPKD can be attributed to mutations
in PKHD1, which encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein, fibrocystin/polyductin (FPC). We currently have
very little insight into the pathogenesis of human ARPKD and thus, treatment is largely supportive.
Striking species-specific differences in the PKHD1/Pkhd1 renal phenotype may offer important insights into
disease mechanisms. While human patients with either missense or truncating PKHD1 mutations have severe
renal cystic disease, mouse Pkhd1 models with engineered truncating mutations (and presumably loss of FPC
function) express minimal or no renal disease. Our preliminary studies reveal that while MYC is overexpressed
in human ARPKD kidneys, Myc is not overexpressed in mouse Pkhd1 kidneys. In previous studies, we have
shown that FPC undergoes Notch-like processing with cleavage of the carboxy terminus (FPC-CTD) from the
plasma membrane and nuclear trafficking. Here, we demonstrate that the mouse FPC-CTD binds directly to the
Myc P1 promoter and increases Myc expression.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that mouse renal epithelia can compensate for the loss of FPC-CTD
function through reno-protective mechanisms and that species-specific, FPC-CTD regulation of Myc expression
is central to this reno-protection. We speculate that while these mechanisms are not normally operative in human
renal epithelia, they may identify new opportunities for therapeutic targeting in human ARPKD renal disease. We
propose two specific aims to test our hypothesis: (1) define how the FPC-CTD regulates Myc/MYC expression
in mouse and human renal epithelia and determine whether disruption of the proposed regulatory circuits is a
central driver of renal cystogenesis; and (2) compare the FPC-CTD nuclear interactome in mouse and human
renal epithelia and test whether differences in transcriptional targets identifies reno-protective pathways in mouse
kidneys.
Our studies will advance the field by sequentially addressing the transcriptional role of FPC-CTD. Specifically,
we will: 1) determine
mouse Pkhd1 models;
how FPC-CTD related Myc transcriptional regulation contributes to reno-protection in
and 2) identify putative mechanisms that allow mouse renal epithelia to compensate for
the loss of FPC-CTD nuclear function. Moving forward, these data will lay the foundation for translating mouse
reno-protective mechanisms into novel, therapeutic strategies that attenuate human PKHD1-related renal cystic
disease."

For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than
90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non-
invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all
cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological
state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules
spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and
prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated
exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle
heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of
cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that
we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1
outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim
encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic
encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2
describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to
binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits
long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface
marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient
plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of
platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume
needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our
progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities."
10817674,"Alphaviruses, a group of enveloped RNA viruses, cause persistent arthritis and encephalitis among horses and humans. Currently, no licensed vaccine or antiviral therapy is available to prevent or cure the disease. A critical step in enveloped virus infection is membrane fusion between the viral and the host cellular membranes, a process leading to cytoplasmic delivery of the viral genome. Alphaviruses enter the host cell via receptor- mediated endocytosis. The viral E1 protein mediates membrane fusion through conformational changes upon acidification in the early endosomes. The other viral envelope protein, E2, functions as a molecular chaperon for the E1 protein during virus assembly and plays a role in virus capsid core uptake at the budding site and release after membrane fusion. We have obtained exciting, unprecedented images that captured robust alphavirus membrane fusion events with target liposomes by cryo-electron microscopy. Using coordinated biochemical, biophysical, cryo-electron microscopy, and cryo-electron tomography methods, we will investigate the molecular structures of the E1 and E2 proteins in a prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus, at specific fusion stages. We will test specific predictions about the alphavirus membrane fusion mechanism based on our structural results by generating and characterizing mutants of the glycoproteins. We will test the fusion function of key mutations in the context of recombinant viruses. Completing this research will advance our understanding about how alphavirus glycoproteins promote membrane fusion."
10815922,"Increased resistance to sinusoidal blood flow is an important component of early as well as advanced
portal hypertension. This results from an imbalance in intrahepatic vasoconstrictor and vasodilator molecules,
the latter including nitric oxide (NO). Our laboratory has been on the cutting edge of advances in
understanding the molecular basis for the imbalance in NO that occurs after liver injury. Seminal among our
discoveries is that there is a (dramatic and remarkable) reduction in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)
dependent NO release by sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) after liver injury. Further, this “endothelialopathy”
is a critical feature of portal hypertension, especially early in disease.
 Our focus has been on understanding the mechanism underlying this defect. Preliminary data presented
in the current application has identified highly novel post-translational defects in eNOS in SECs after liver
injury, including reduced phosphorylation of eNOS caused by abnormalities in molecules that form a
macromolecular regulatory complex that controls eNOS function (including the following G protein coupled
receptor (GPCR) regulatory proteins: β-arrestins, GIT1 and now β-PIX). Additionally, many of these partners
are regulated during liver injury. In the current project, we will test the highly focused and innovative central
hypothesis that the GIT1/β-PIX complex and its partners play a fundamental role in regulating eNOS function.
 Therefore, overarching goals of this new project are twofold. First, we wish to uncover fundamental basic
mechanisms that regulate eNOS function. Secondly, with a future objective being to translate our work to
humans with liver disease, we wish to validate the importance of the proposed signaling pathways in vivo.
Therefore, our specific aims are as follows: We will (1) determine how β-PIX, as a GIT1 binding partner, exerts
a dual role in post-translational regulation of eNOS activity in normal versus injured SECs, and (2) we will
characterize the function of the GIT1/β-PIX complex partner, paxillin, in regulating eNOS function through
interaction with β-PIX and GIT1 after liver injury. The proposed experiments will uncover novel mechanistic
aspects of eNOS function and as such have fundamental therapeutic implications not only for patients with liver
disease and portal hypertension, but also for those with other vascular disorders."

More than 9% of the US population has diabetes, with an additional 25% being treated for pre-diabetes, and
this epidemic continues to rise annually. As diabetes progresses, >60% of Type II and >95% of Type I
diabetics develop diabetic retinopathy; one of the leading causes of blindness in the working-age population
worldwide. Currently, there are no preventative therapies to inhibit the asymptomatic chronic inflammation that
slowly destroys retinal cells, which leads to vascular lesions and the onset of diabetic retinopathy. With such a
significant impact on human health, new therapies are required to stay abreast of this diabetes complication.
One of the most promising therapeutic targets lie within the inflammatory response, because inflammation can
mediate much of the pathogenesis in diabetes complications. In a murine model of Streptozotocin (STZ)-
induced-diabetes, we determined that diabetes mediated the production of Interleukin-17A (IL-17), one of the
most prevalent cytokines associated with autoimmune and inflammatory pathogenesis. We also found that IL-
17 induced vascular permeability and capillary degeneration in the retina, which are hallmarks of non-
proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Finally, we identified IL-17 receptor and the CIKS (Connection to IB Kinase
and Stress activated protein) adaptor molecule constitutively expressed on multiple retina cells, which elicits
retinal inflammation, oxidative stress, and the vascular lesions. The goal of this proposal is to unravel the IL-17
receptor/CIKS signaling events involved in retinal pathogenesis to reveal novel therapeutic targets for the early
onset of diabetic retinopathy. We postulate that diabetes mediates a cascade of CIKS-TRAF (TNF Receptor
Associated Factor) signaling events that initiate oxidative stress and retinal inflammation, which lead to
vascular permeability and capillary degeneration in the retina. This is a precursor to the onset of proliferative
diabetic retinopathy and vision loss. By using murine models of STZ-induced diabetes and ex vivo retina
assays, we will identify the mechanism within the CIKS-TRAF signaling cascade that initiates retinal
inflammation and pathogenesis. Through these studies therapeutic targets will be identified, which we
postulate will delay the onset of diabetic retinopathy and inhibit vision loss."

10823221,"Summary/Abstract
 Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common inflammatory skin disease. Recent observations strongly suggest
that the abnormal microbiome present on the skin of subjects with AD is a major factor that influences the
severity and chronic nature of this disorder. In particular, Staphylococcus aureus promotes epidermal barrier
dysfunction and exacerbates the local and systemic immune response. In healthy subjects, beneficial
members of the skin microbiome act to limit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus but these beneficial bacterial
strains are missing on adults with AD. This project seeks to understand why adults with AD lack beneficial
bacterial strains by study of the survival of a prototype strain of Staphylococcus hominis on AD skin.
Interventions to improve its survival will be tested, and application in the pediatric AD population will be
evaluated. Overall, successful completion of the proposed aims of this ADRN Clinical Research Center will
advance understanding of AD and provide essential information to permit development of an innovative new

10823225,"Familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) is caused by dominant mutations in the amyloid-β (Aβ) precursor
protein (APP) and presenilin-1 and -2 (PSEN1, PSEN2). APP is cleaved by β-secretase, then within its single
transmembrane domain (TMD) by γ-secretase to produce Aβ, which deposits as cerebral plaques. PSEN is the
catalytic component of γ-secretase, a membrane-embedded protease complex. Thus, FAD mutations are only
in the substrate and protease that produce Aβ; nevertheless, pathogenic mechanisms remain controversial.
Most PSEN FAD mutations show reduced proteolysis (loss of function) but also increase proportions of
aggregation-prone 42-residue Aβ peptide (Aβ42) (gain of function). However, γ-secretase has multiple
proteolytic functions: Initial endoproteolytic (ε) cleavage of APP substrate produces long Aβ that is trimmed via
a carboxypeptidase activity, and FAD-mutant γ-secretases are deficient in this trimming function.
 New understanding of multiple proteolytic functions of γ-secretase along with recent cryo-EM structure
elucidation of the protease-substrate complex now make possible a deeper understanding of effects of FAD
mutations. The goal here is to combine chemical, structural, and computational biology to elucidate how
presenilin FAD mutations alter γ-secretase structure, dynamics, and function. Such understanding should give
insight into how this membrane-embedded protease complex recognizes and processively proteolyzes
transmembrane substrates, provide critical clues to pathogenic mechanisms of FAD, and suggest new
strategies for prevention of FAD. To this end, we propose to:
 (1) Develop chemical probes to trap γ-secretase in different stages of substrate interaction for structural
analysis by cryo-EM. We developed full TMD substrate mimics to trap active enzyme in a conformation poised
for intramembrane proteolysis. Designed variations should allow visualization of the transition states for ε
proteolysis, carboxypeptidase cleavage, TMD helix unwinding, and lateral gating of substrate.
 (2) Perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of substrate interaction with FAD-mutant γ-secretase.
We computationally restored catalytic aspartates, modeled entry of water to the active site, and captured
activation of the computationally restored WT enzyme. We will determine effects of FAD PSEN1 mutations on
γ-secretase structural dynamics and interaction with APP substrate and TMD mimics.
 (3) Develop synthetic substrate probes for analysis of proteolytic dysfunction of FAD-mutant γ-secretase.
We developed a set of such functional probes of γ-secretase processing of APP TMD, validating them as
convenient and appropriate synthetic surrogates for APP substrate. We will employ these and other proposed
substrate probes to determine effects of FAD-mutant γ-secretases on ε proteolysis and specific
carboxypeptidase trimming steps."

On February 3, 2023, a freight train derailed and caught fire in the town of East Palestine, Ohio. Of the derailed
rail cars, ~20 of them were carrying hazardous materials, which were released into the air, soil, and water. Of
further concern, a controlled release/burning of the remaining toxic chemicals was performed prompting
officials to order an immediate mandatory evacuation of all residents. The evacuation order was lifted after the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released a statement that air quality was safe. However, residents
remain concerned about safety, while others have reported symptoms including headaches and difficulty
breathing, as well as odors in the home and in the community. At present, a systematic evaluation of the
experiences, exposures, and health symptoms (including stress outcomes), of the residents of East Palestine
and the surrounding area related to the train derailment disaster has not been conducted. Although multiple
entities – including federal and state agencies, and academic research teams – have been collecting
environmental and health data, community members are being bombarded with information and scientific data
that is not being communicated effectively. Moreover, the community does not have a structured mechanism to
provide their insight or recommendations for research. Thus, there is a clear need for a researcher network
and mechanisms to engage the community and facilitate dissemination of research findings. This proposal will
take the critical foundational steps toward launching longitudinal investigations of exposures and health
impacts and ensuring effective and targeted communication of results to residents in the East Palestine
community and surrounding populations. Given our longstanding community-engaged environmental health
science research studies in nearby communities, we are strategically poised to accomplish the following
specific aims. Aim 1: Examine experiences/concerns, health symptoms, psychosocial/traumatic stress,
emotional well-being, trust networks, and environmental health literacy of residents of East Palestine and the
surrounding area related to the train derailment disaster, as well as changes in these measures over time; and
Aim 2: Enhance communication among the scientific research community, federal, state, and local agencies,
and the East Palestine community. This time-sensitive and highly relevant study provides the first opportunity
for community members to identify their research priorities based on their experiences/concerns and includes a
health tracking study (via an online survey) to fully characterize and collect longitudinal measures of health
symptoms, stress, and well-being of East Palestine residents. To inform best practices for future disaster
response research, we will evaluate the impact of community-researcher interactions on building both trust and
environmental health literacy over time. The proposed study will also establish a researcher network to
enhance study methodology and inform research dissemination strategies."
10819968,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this Phase II STTR project is to develop an intuitive AI-powered system, called Midlinatm, which will
automate the conversion/generation of accessible STEM materials from visual formats and flexibly deliver the
accessible content across multiple hardware and software platforms to support blind and visually impaired
(BVI) learners. Timely access to STEM materials is one of the biggest challenges for BVI learners, limiting their
productivity and success. While access to textual information has largely been solved via screen reading software
(e.g., JAWS or VoiceOver), very little progress has been made in making non-textual (i.e., graphical) information
accessible for BVI people. With STEM curricula being dominated by non-textual information (e.g., diagrams,
graphs, charts, images, mathematical notations), the visual nature of this critical information prevents more than
660,000 school-aged (ages 4-21) BVI learners from pursuing STEM curricula. Current technologies/devices
address the issue via human-driven approaches using specialized single purpose hardware that suffer from
several shortcomings including high cost, limited portability, lack of multi-purpose, and inability to present
information in a real-time context. Importantly, a common underlying problem across all extant approaches is
that they require intensive human efforts for producing or authoring tactile (and/or multimodal) graphics. These
approaches lead to high production costs and significant delays from the time the accessible materials are needed
to when they are actually delivered; ultimately adversely impacting BVI individuals’ learning and advancement
in K-12 schools, colleges, and performance in workplace settings. To address this long-standing problem, in
Phase I, UNAR Labs developed a prototype version of Midlina’s framework using Math worksheets as an
example and demonstrated its practical utility by implementing it on a prototype web application, called Kanak.
In this Phase II effort, UNAR Labs will build on the success of Phase I by extending the capability of Midlina’s
framework and establishing it as a commercially viable platform technology for generating/converting STEM
materials into accessible formats. We will also develop and deploy two Midlina-powered applications, (1) Kanak
–a web application aimed at aiding teachers and TVIs with real-time accessible document creation, and (2)
MathAlly – an IOS app that helps BVI learners access accessible math materials in real-time. The team is highly
experienced in developing assistive technology solutions. Successful completion of the project will provide a
robust system for increasing the participation of BVI individuals in STEM programs and will make educational
institutions more inclusive and equitable."
10823393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the greater than 350 Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases (PID) in humans that have been identified to date,
the molecular basis of a significant number (~100) of PIDs have yet to be defined. Recently, 9 children (4 now
deceased) from 4 independent families were identified with severe PIDs that were linked to mutations in the
NCKAP1L gene encoding for Hematopoietic protein-1 (Hem-1), a conserved hematopoietic cell-specific
component the WAVE actin regulatory complex (WRC). Affected children presented with severe recurring
respiratory and skin infections, failed antibody responses to pneumococcal immunization (characteristic of B
cell immunodeficiency), dysregulated cytokine production, and autoimmunity. Although the cellular and
molecular functions of Hem-1 orthologues in flies and worms are relatively well characterized, there is a critical
knowledge gap regarding the cell specific functions of Hem-1 in the development and functions of primary
immune cells. Our longterm goal is to overcome this knowledge gap by dissecting the cell-specific roles of
Hem-1 in the development and functions of adaptive and innate immune cells. The objective of this proposal is
to disrupt Hem-1 expression in primary murine and human B lymphocytes in a B cell-specific manner to define
the roles of Hem-1 in B cell development, protective humoral immunity, and autoimmunity. Our Specific Aims
are to utilize inducible B cell specific gene targeting in mice, and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated Hem1 deletion in
“humanized mice”, to test our central hypotheses that B cell specific disruption in Hem1 results in: (1) impaired
B cell development in part due to reduced homing and retention of developing B cell progenitors in essential
lymphoid niches;(2) absent T cell independent antibody responses resulting in crippled protective immunity to
influenza A virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, important community acquired respiratory pathogens; and
(3) hyper-responsive B cell signaling and T-bet driven transcriptome, resulting in increased autoantibody
production. To demonstrate feasibility, we have generated innovative mouse models to emulate Hem1 PID
patients including mice with a non-coding point mutation in Hem1 (Hem1pt/pt), Hem1 null (Hem1-/-) mice,
Hem1floxed (Hem1fl/fl) mice, as well as Hem1 deficient ”humanized mice” which contain Hem1 deficient
primary human hematopoietic cells. Based on our preliminary results which strongly support our hypotheses,
we expect that the results of these studies will be highly significant and will have a high impact because they
will define for the first time, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how loss-of-function variants in
NCLAP1L disrupt B cell development, signaling, and protective antibody-mediated immunity resulting in PID
and autoimmunity. Because of extensive genetic heterogeneity of the 4 human PID families, limited number of
patients, and concurrent infections, the development of these innovative mouse model systems are critical for
dissecting the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how mutations in Hem-1 result in PID and autoimmunity,
and to provide much needed platforms to develop and test therapies to treat and cure Hem1 deficient children."

 This project aims to reveal the molecular mechanisms underpinning initiation of innate immune activation and
the innate immune response during flavivirus infection. Flaviviruses comprise a number of emerging and re-
emerging pathogens with a global disease burden of over 400 million infections each year. West Nile virus (WNV)
is an emerging neurotropic flavivirus that serves as a model flavivirus and is itself the number one arbovirus
infection in the United States. Infection with WNV elicits a primary innate immune response through activation of
the RIG-I-like receptor pattern recognition receptor signaling pathway when RIG-I detects viral pathogen
associated molecular patterns (PAMP). However, the identity and features of viral RNA (vRNA) that drive this
response as well as how sequestered vRNA is sensed by cytosolic RIG-I remain unknown.
 The proposed research aims to identify the species of and molecular motifs within WNV vRNA that drive a
productive innate immune activation and response (Aim 1) and to pinpoint the intracellular sites of vRNA-RLR
interaction in the infected cell to define the relationship between vRNA localization within/outside of viral
replication compartments and innate immune activation (Aim 2). Our preliminary data has uncovered a role for
single-stranded viral replication intermediates (negative-sense vRNA) in driving early innate immune activation.
In Aim 1, cellular subpopulations will be sorted based on innate immune activation status then subjected to RNA
sequencing to further identify specific species of vRNA associated with innate immune activation. Further
analysis of vRNA bound to RIG-I during infection will be performed with immunoprecipitation followed by RNA
sequencing and specific immunostimulatory nucleotides will be mapped via individual nucleotide resolution
cross-linked immunoprecipitation (iCLIP). In Aim 2, novel vRNA-RLR proximity ligation assays alongside
immunofluorescence will be used to pinpoint cellular locations of innate immune activation. Innovative cryo-
electron tomography (cryo-ET) coupled with RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization via correlative light and
electron microscopy (CLEM) will be used to define the relationship between immunostimulatory RNAs and viral
replication compartments at the ultrastructural level.
 In addition to revealing the identify and location of immunostimulatory vRNAs during WNV infection, the work
in this proposal will facilitate training in multiple cutting-edge techniques including iCLIP, RNA sequencing and
bioinformatics, and high-resolution imaging including cryo-ET and CLEM, with the support of co-sponsors who
are experts in flavivirology and innate immunity and viral ultrastructure and imaging techniques. Technical and
conceptual training provided will support the transition of the trainee to an independent investigator in RNA
virology and innate immune activation, while research findings will provide conceptual advances in our
understanding of RLR-signaling during flavivirus infection."
10818339,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A novel class of oral nicotine pouches that contain a nicotine powder instead of tobacco leaves have recently
emerged and fall under FDA’s purview, but there is virtually no research to inform the regulation of these
products. These novel pouches are rapidly growing in popularity. For example, in 2020, dollar sales in U.S.
convenience stores grew by 470% for ‘Zyn’, a leading brand of these pouches. Our preliminary research indicates
that these products are being marketed heavily to consumers, often with advertising tactics that may convey
modified risk (i.e., descriptors of “tobacco-free”). These pouches contain non-tobacco flavors (e.g., fruit) with
known appeal to youth. Tobacco industry research shows that these pouches deliver similar, or greater, levels
of nicotine to users than traditional smokeless oral tobacco products, suggesting that they can produce
dependence. Because FDA applies a public health standard when regulating tobacco products, the risks and
benefits of novel oral nicotine pouches must be considered for current smokers (a population that may benefit
from switching to novel nicotine pouches) and non-nicotine users, especially youth (a population for whom
nicotine pouch use would have negative public health consequences). Using human lab studies, marketing
surveillance, and web-based experiments, this innovative project will elucidate product features and marketing
tactics that may drive initiation and continued use of novel oral nicotine pouches for smokers and non-nicotine
users, including youth, addressing FDA CTP’s areas of scientific interest in Addiction/Abuse Liability, Behavior,
and Marketing Influences. In Aim 1, smokers will use pouches of different flavors (tobacco; mint; fruit) and
nicotine doses (low; high), and their own brand of cigarettes, over 7 lab sessions and pharmacokinetic (PK) and
pharmacodynamic (PD) effects (e.g., subjective abuse liability and tobacco withdrawal) will be assessed. In Aim
2, we will surveil advertisements for novel nicotine pouches over 5 years to identify/monitor marketing tactics
and examine, via web-based experiments, how common tactics influence product perceptions (i.e., perceived
harm, addictiveness, and appeal) and use intentions among cigarette smokers and youth non-nicotine users. In
Aim 3, we will conduct a second lab study with smokers and adult non-nicotine users to determine how a common
marketing tactic (e.g., “tobacco-free” descriptors) impacts use behaviors and PK/PD effects of these pouches.
This project will provide vital new data on product features and marketing tactics that may influence whether
smokers and non-nicotine users (including youth) initiate, continue using, and possibly become addicted to novel
oral nicotine pouches. This information will allow FDA to make informed decisions about what features should
be allowable in novel nicotine pouches, how accessible they should be, and what marketing tactics should be
permissible. Ultimately, this research can protect public health by informing polices to mitigate use of these
pouches by nicotine-naïve youth as well as policies that may facilitate product switching for smokers."
10818342,"The goal of this proposal is to determine the role of tGLI1 (truncated glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1)
in breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM). Our laboratory discovered tGLI1 as an alternatively spliced GLI1 that
lacks entire exon 3 and part of exon 4, but retains the ability to undergo nuclear transport and respond to sonic
hedgehog-smoothened signaling. In addition to activating known GLI1 target genes, tGLI1 gains the ability to
activate genes not regulated by GLI1, leading to increased migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Whether tGLI1
plays any role in metastasis of any tumor type is unknown. Our mouse studies indicated that tGLI1 promotes
breast cancer preferential metastasis to the brain and conversely, tGLI1 knockdown selectively suppressed
BCBM. tGLI1 protein is overexpressed in lymph node metastases and BCBM samples. In elucidating how tGLI1
promotes BCBM, we found that exosomes secreted from tGLI1-high cancer cells strongly activated astrocytes,
the most abundant brain cells known to promote tumor growth when activated, and that tGLI1-high cancer cells
had an increased ability to interact with and activate astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. Since microRNAs can be
loaded into exosomes and circulating tumor exosomal miRNAs can prime distant organs for organ-specific
metastasis, we conducted an exosomal miRNA microarray followed by validations and found that tGLI1-high
cancer cells secreted high levels of exosomal miR-1290 and miR-1246 in vitro and in vivo. Whether miR-1290
and miR-1246 play any role in brain metastasis of any cancer or astrocytes is unknown. We observed that
miR-1290/1246 inhibited expression of two transcription repressors (FOXA2 and SOX9), which leads to secretion
of ciliary neurotropic factor (CNTF) to activate astrocytes and stimulate cancer cells. We hypothesize that
tumoral tGLI1 promotes brain metastasis by priming astrocytes in the metastatic niche, and activated astrocytes
in turn facilitate BCBM through secreting CNTF. We further hypothesize that tGLI1-high breast cancer cells
prime astrocytes via the novel signaling axis: tumoral tGLI1→exosomal miR-1290/1246┤astrocyte FOXA2/
SOX9┤astrocyte CNTF→astrocyte activation. In Aim 1, we will determine the extent to which tGLI1 promotes
BCBM using three mouse models (cell line-derived xenograft, PDX, and transgenic mice), overexpression and
knockdown approaches, two inoculation routes (intracardiac and mammary fat pad injections), and human
patient samples. In Aim 2, we will examine whether and how tumoral tGLI1 upregulates exosomal miR-
1290/1246 to activate astrocytes in the metastatic niche, and clarify how miR-1290/1246 suppress FOXA2 and
SOX9 expression within astrocytes, how FOXA2 and SOX9 repress CNTF expression, and the role of CNTF in
astrocyte activation and BCBM progression. In Aim 3, we will examine if miR-1290 and miR-1246 play essential
roles in tGLI1-mediated BCBM, identify their downstream targets, and elucidate the roles of intracellular miR-
1290/1246 in BCBM. The project could define tGLI1, miR-1290/1246, and CNTF as novel mediators of BCBM
and regulators of astrocytes in the metastatic niche, thus providing novel mechanistic insights into BCBM."
10818390,"The objective of this proposal is to provide rigorous training in all aspects of translational research related to
regenerative medicine. There is a bourgeoning need for creative, critical, and responsible transdisciplinary
scientists as thought leaders and administrators who will spearhead national efforts to bring regenerative
medicine into widespread clinical practice. This national need was demonstrated by Congress's 21st Century
Cures Act that established regenerative medicine as one of four national research areas in desperate need of
clinical translation. This proposal integrates Boston University's marquee programs in biomedical engineering,
pluripotent stem cell biology, human organoid in vitro disease modeling, precision medicine, gene editing, stem
cell banking, and computational biomedicine to produce an extraordinarily rigorous and comprehensive training
program in the emerging, futuristic discipline known broadly as “regenerative medicine.” This proposed renewal
of the already successful Regenerative Training Program (RMTP), now in its 4th year, is geared to expanding
and maturing this nascent program into a clinically-focused training experience for 6 pre-doctoral and 2 post-
doctoral trainees. The proposed RMTP renewal incorporates mentored cross-disciplinary research, exciting
courses taught by the leaders of these marquee programs, and additional training in critical thinking, scientific
writing, oral presenting, and familiarity with the complex ethics that will face tomorrow's national thought leaders
as regenerative medicine research moves from bench to bedside. To prepare for tomorrow's challenges and
augment diversity in the research workforce, this renewal includes an innovative, novel year-long Post-
baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that recruits students from backgrounds that are
traditionally underrepresented in biomedical research. An additional, novel goal of this TL1 is to pioneer the
development of regenerative medicine core competencies for the CTSA. These competencies will maintain rigor
of training and equip scholars to become leaders in translational regenerative medicine research. Beyond
training superb scholars, the many deliverables of this renewed RMTP will include shareable patient-specific
stem cell repositories procured from at risk patient populations as well as from the entire Framingham Study
cohort, sophisticated protocols that will allow any CTSA institution to prepare patient-derived organoids in vitro,
and hands-on training courses or on line modules that will disseminate this expertise freely across the entire
CTSA. This “open-source” approach to science is central to the mission of BU's Center for Regenerative
Medicine, the physical home of many TL1 faculty, labs and resources."
10818371,"Human babesiosis is a tick-borne malaria-like illness with a worldwide distribution and endemic in the United
States. The disease joined the list of CDC-nationally notifiable diseases in 2011 due to the increasing number of
reported cases. The majority of clinical cases in the US have been linked to Babesia microti whereas Babesia
duncani cases have been reported primarily from Washington, Oregon, and California. However, due to the lack
of specific diagnostic assays and because immune competent individuals can be asymptomatic, the true
incidence of babesiosis cases in the US and worldwide is most likely underestimated. There is no vaccine against
human babesiosis and current therapies are not effective, require high doses and some of them are associated
with major side effects. Even with these drugs and other supportive measures, the case fatality rate exceeds
20% in susceptible hosts. During the past 8 years, we gained significant understanding of the biology,
pathogenesis and drug susceptibility of Babesia parasites that infect humans: (1) we completed the first genomic
and transcriptomic analyses and annotations of B. microti and B. duncani; (2) probed the genomic diversity of B.
microti in human blood and ticks; (3) demonstrated that B. microti and B. duncani are inherently tolerant to
clinically recommended therapies; (4) discovered a combination therapy that results in radical cure of B. microti
infection in mice; (5) completed the first immunoproteomic analysis of B. microti, identified the main
immunodominant antigens of this parasite, and developed the first diagnostic assay for detection of active B.
microti infection; and (6) discovered a vesicular-based secretion system used by the parasite to export some of
its proteins to the host. Of particular relevance to the current RFA, we used immunoproteomic and proteomic
approaches to identify secreted and surface-displayed proteins of B. microti and B. duncani, and for more than
30 B. microti antigens determine their serological profile in sera from infected mice and humans. The main
hypothesis of this proposal is that some of the exported antigens of B. microti and B. duncani could serve as
vaccines to illicit antibodies to block Babesia invasion of host erythrocytes or to facilitate elimination of Babesia-
infected erythrocytes by host macrophages. The primary goals of this application are to further characterize the
immunogenicity profile of these secreted antigens, and to conduct vaccination studies in mice to identify those
antigens that could be developed as vaccines against Babesia microti and B. duncani infections. In Aim 1, we
will produce functional recombinant forms of secreted and surface displayed proteins of B. microti and B. duncani
and use them to determine the serological profile and kinetics of the humoral immune responses using mouse
and human sera. In Aim 2. We will conduct cell biological studies to determine the secretion and cellular
distribution of the candidate exported antigens during the intraerythrocytic life cycle of these parasites. In Aim 3,
we will conduct immunization studies in mouse models of B. microti and B. duncani infections to identify those
antigens that are effective vaccines when administered in human-compatible adjuvants."
10819148,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Problem: Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most common malignant salivary gland cancer. The
treatment for MEC still is radical surgery and radiotherapy (in selected cases), as no systemic therapy has been
approved for this cancer. Consequently, current treatment strategies are typically associated with high morbidity,
poor quality of life, frequent tumor relapse and low 5-year survival rates for patients with advanced disease.
Rationale: Relentless tumor growth, resistance to cytotoxic therapy and high incidence of tumor relapse are the
major challenges in MEC treatment. Our group demonstrated that MEC progression is mediated by a relatively
small population of tumor-initiating cells that exhibit a stem-like state characterized by multipotency and self-
renewal, named here cancer stem-like cells (CSC). In MEC, cancer stemness is exhibited by cells with high
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity and high CD44 expression (ALDHhighCD44high cells). These cells are
uniquely resistant to cytotoxic therapy. Surprisingly, cytotoxic agents not only do not kill CSCs, but actually induce
cancer stemness while inhibiting tumor growth. In our search for a targetable vulnerability of MEC CSCs, we
made the following observations: A) The decrease in MEC CSC fraction mediated by therapeutic inhibition of
either mTOR or MDM2-p53 signaling is associated with downregulation of Bmi-1 expression. B) Bmi-1 is
constitutively upregulated by MEC CSCs. These observations suggested that Bmi-1 may play a significant role
in MEC CSCs that could be exploited therapeutically. Bmi-1 is a component of the polycomb repressive complex-
1 (PRC1) that functions as a critical regulator of stem cell self-renewal. However, Bmi-1’s effect on MEC
tumorigenesis and cancer stemness are unknown. Notably, recent clinical trials in patients with ovarian cancer
and pediatric glioma are exploring the safety/efficacy of a novel class of small molecule inhibitors of Bmi-1.
However, it is unclear whether therapeutic inhibition of Bmi-1 is sufficient to overcome the intrinsic resistance of
MEC CSCs to cytotoxic agents. Here, we propose mechanistic and translational studies using a combination of
genetic and pharmacologic approaches to understand the function of Bmi-1 and the therapeutic potential of
targeting Bmi-1 in MEC. Our overall hypothesis is “Bmi-1 drives tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in MEC”.
To address this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: S.A.#1: To define the function of Bmi-1 on
MEC tumorigenesis. S.A.#2: To define the effect of therapeutic inhibition of Bmi-1 on MEC stemness and tumor
relapse. S.A.#3: To determine the effect of an anti-CSC strategy (Bmi-1 inhibition) combined with an anti-bulk
tumor cell strategy (cytotoxic therapy) in preclinical trials conducted in xenograft models of resistant MEC.
Significance: This work will begin to define the effect of direct targeting of CSCs with Bmi-1 inhibitors on the
treatment outcome for MEC. Our long-term goal is to develop a mechanism-based therapy that prevents tumor
relapse and that improves the survival and quality of life of patients with MEC. Successful outcomes of this study
might be pertinent to the treatment of patients with other types of chemoresistant glandular malignancies."
10819150,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a uniformly fatal disease with very few clinical options. Despite modest advancements in surgical
procedures, radiation and chemotherapy, median survival from diagnosis is only around 14 months. Upon recurrence, few
effective treatment options exist. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits VEGF-A, received
accelerated FDA approval in May 2009 for use in recurrent GBM and quickly became the standard of care for recurrent
GBM in the United States. Almost all patients receive bevacizumab at some point in their treatment. Because bevacizumab
plays such an important role in the management of GBM, the development of imaging biomarkers to improve risk
stratification and predict patient benefit is highly desired. Such a biomarker would be clinically useful for identifying
patients that will benefit from bevacizumab as well as scientifically useful for cohort enrichment in the next phase of
combination therapies or exploratory studies aimed at high-risk patients, where conventional therapies like bevacizumab
are likely to fail.
 Extensive preliminary data (>7 trials in >400 patients) suggests diffusion MRI characteristics are a strong, independent
predictor of anti-VEGF therapeutic efficacy in recurrent GBM, with patients exhibiting a significant survival benefit if they
present with a high apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) within contrast enhancing tumor. Data also suggests these diffusion
MR signatures may result from an elevated expression of decorin (DCN), a glycoprotein with a variety of functions. We
hypothesize that the survival advantage and imaging signatures arise from the multifaceted functions of DCN, which include
anti-angiogenic characteristics and softening of the extracellular matrix, which we theorize would result in increased
effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapies and an increase in ADC.
 The current study will explore the causal, mechanistic links between DCN expression, diffusion MRI, and anti-VEGF
treatment efficacy. First, Aim 1 will involve a deep exploration into the association between diffusion MR phenotypes and
DCN expression in human GBM using image-guided biopsies and examining DCN protein expression using
immunohistochemistry and gene expression using in-situ hybridization. The relationship between diffusion MRI, DCN
expression, and corresponding genotypes using whole exome analysis, genetic subtypes using bulk RNA sequencing,
cellular states using single-cell RNA sequencing, and blood plasma levels of circulating DCN will also be performed.
Concurrently, Aim 2 will establish the causal, mechanistic links between DCN expression, diffusion MRI measurements,
and anti-VEGF treatment in GBM through ca complex, genetically modified patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDX)
preclinical trial. To accomplish this, a series of patient-derived cell lines will be edited to silence of overexpress DCN within
PDX models using a tetracycline-controlled gene expression system. The direct role of DCN expression in changing
diffusion MRI measurements and increasing survival following anti-VEGF therapy by turning on or off DCN expression
using doxycycline will be determined."
10817281,"The traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature provides preliminary evidence supporting associations
between TBI exposures and poor health and functional outcomes, particularly as they occur in
the context of the traumatic and stressful circumstances of military deployment. There is still much
to be understood, however, regarding the associations of patient and injury characteristics with
the prognosis of psychological health, physical health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes.
TBI has been a priority research area among veterans and military service personnel due to its
high prevalence in these populations. Ongoing longitudinal cohort studies of service members
and veterans with military combat and training exposures offer researchers access to extant data
addressing factors that modify risks for developing and/or recovering from a range of brain
disorders, including TBI, PTSD, pain, depression, and suicidality. Pooling individual participant
level data from longitudinal TBI research studies will result in a large enough dataset to consider
relevant moderators, mediators, and confounders in analyses and allow for more impactful and
clinically meaningful findings. In order to address the present knowledge gaps and harmonize
largescale, multi-modal data from varied sources, well-planned and reproducible standardization,
curation, and dissemination is needed to allow for meaningful analyses. The Long-term Impact of
Military-relevant Brain Injury Consortium's Prospective Longitudinal Study (PLS) is a 10-year, 17-
site cohort of >2,500 service members and veteran participants with combat-exposure who are
well-characterized initially and then have annual reassessments. The Translational Research
Center for TBI and Stress Disorders is a 14-year, 2-site longitudinal cohort of >925 veterans with
combat-exposure who are deeply characterized initially and then undergo comprehensive
reassessment at 2, 5 and 10 years. These two ongoing, prospective, longitudinal cohorts of active
duty and veteran service members offer access to a wide range of potential risk factors that can
affect response to care and outcomes including demographics (age, sex, race, ACEs, SDOH),
injury characteristics (pre-exposure factors, exposure factors), biomarkers including genetics and
epigenetics (serum, saliva, brain imaging, evoked potentials), and functional measures (functional
neuroimaging, EEG, computerized posturography, computerized eye tracking, special senses
testing, clinical examination, neuropsychological assessments, symptom questionnaires). While
there is considerable overlap across the LIMBIC and TRACTS cohorts' data elements,
considerable harmonization of the tools used and data obtained is needed to allow for valid and
meaningful analyses across cohorts. Additionally, a standardized and robust approach to the
clinical translation of the data to actionable risk stratification and/or clinical utility is necessary. For
this proposal, the researchers will work to create a curated, unified dataset and will target the use
of that unified dataset to demonstrate the feasibility of analytic approaches to detect for
associations between objective, functional physiologic measures of TBI-related dysfunction,
including evoked potentials, electroencephalograms, computerized posturography and
computerized eye tracking, with clinically-relevant outcome measures of TBI, including symptom
burden and response to treatment. This proposed research will lay the foundations for the use of
extant and ongoing prospective, longitudinal datasets and linked big datasets (e.g., VINCI, CDW,
DaVINCI, FITBIR) to generate generalizable, clinically relevant information on the role of
objective, measurable assessments of brain function after TBI."
10806202,"This application seeks to conduct a phase Ib proof-of-concept clinical trial at the Houston VA Lung Precision
Oncology Program (LPOP) to determine if intratumor injections with pooled human immunoglobulins (IVIG) plus
an immune adjuvant are safe. Patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who receive immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show treatment resistance. Solid tumors fail to establish in unrelated hosts because
of the host’s antibodies that deposit immune complexes and activate local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the
tumor. Further, established tumors from related donors injected with alloantibodies plus an adjuvant, poly-IC, a
potent TLR-3 agonist, abrogated the original tumors and their distant metastasis in mice. In a single phase I study,
patients with solid tumors refractory to ICIs tolerated multiple intratumoral (IT) and intramuscular (IM) injections
with a stabilized form of poly-IC, such as poly-ICLC, (Hiltonol®; Oncovir Inc, USA). However, whether IVIG
intratumor injections can cause immune complex formation and, combined with TLR-3 agonists, can enhance
ICIs in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), remains unknown. Our preliminary data
indicate that IVIG (Hizentra®) binds to antigens found in human NSCLC, indicating that like the preclinical models,
intratumor injection with IVIG could induce immune complexes, inducing antitumor responses. We will test our
overarching hypothesis that IT injection of IVIG + poly-ICLC and IM injection of poly-ICLC to boost APCs, are
safe and can activate antitumor immunity in patients with advanced NSCLC with the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: To determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of intratumor injection of an
immune adjuvant plus alloantibodies in veterans with advanced NSCLC. Hypothesis: a combination of
intratumor (IT) injections of IVIG + poly-ICLC, and IM injections of poly-ICLC are safe in patients with advanced-
stage NSCLC. We plan to conduct a first-in-human phase Ib single-center study at the Lung Precision Oncology
Program (LPOP) MEDVAMC site titled: Harnessing Allo-Immunity To Enhance Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in
Advanced NSCLC (HAITEN-ICI). The study objective will be to evaluate the safety of, and maximum tolerated
dose (MTD) of IT injections of a peripherally accessible metastatic site with IVIG + poly-ICLC followed by IM
poly-ICLC in veterans with stage IV NSCLC (N=16) who are eligible to receive systemic ICIs monotherapy. The
primary endpoint includes assessment of an MTD dose for IT injection of IVIG + poly-ICLC, and IM injection of
poly-ICLC given in combination with ICI in the same cohort. Specific Aim 2: To determine the progression-
free survival in response to immune adjuvant plus alloantibodies in veterans with advanced NSCLC.
Hypothesis: compared to standard of care (SOC), poly-ICLC + IVIG improve progression-free survival in patients
with advanced NSCLC receiving ICI. If our proof-of-concept pilot study conducted as part of Aim 1 shows no
safety concerns, and we identify MTD, we will proceed with a phase II multi-center randomized clinical trial to
determine the safety and progression-free survival (PFS) in veterans with advanced NSCLC treated with
intertumoral IVIG + poly-ICLC, compared to SOC. Specific Aim 3: To explore immune responses in pre-and
post-intratumor treatment with IVIG + poly-ICLC in Phase Ib & II cohorts. Hypothesis: intratumor injections
using IVIG + poly-ICLC activates adaptive immune responses in advanced NSCLC patients. We will examine
pre-, mid-and post-treatment systemic immune activation in comparison with baseline in patients enrolled in pilot
phase Ib and if safe, in phase II study. We will compare pre- and post-therapy immune responses using state-of-
the-art technologies for locoregional tumors. The proposed two-stage clinical trial is a novel approach to
determine if inducing tumor-specific immune responses can enhance systemic ICI treatment and improve clinical
outcomes for veterans with advanced NSCLC. Therefore, a combined treatment with an immune adjuvant such
as poly-ICLC, plus IVIG could provide a novel approach to overcoming the tumor-suppressive microenvironment."
10806966,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cancer cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are three critical
factors contributing to tumor progression in colorectal cancer and squamous cell carcinoma, among other
cancer types. CAFs are often associated with the development of high-grade malignancies of poor prognoses
because CAFs secrete metastasis-promoting cytokines and abnormally deposit collagen, facilitating integrin-
dependent cancer invasion and forming hindrance of anti-cancer drug delivery. Despite the detailed studies
about the role of CAFs in tumor progression, the mechanism by which stromal cells become CAFs is still not
clear: how normal fibroblasts in stroma are transformed to CAFs during early stages of cancer? In this project, I
will test the hypothesis that cancer cells facilitate CAF induction by mechanically reorganizing extracellular
matrix and thus breaking down the diffusion barrier of CAF-inducing factors. A coculture system containing
colorectal cancer spheroids and multiple types of stromal cells as the testing platform will be constructed for
the preliminary tests. If proven valid, I will use my hypothesis to develop new treatments where ECM
remodeling is suppressed to decrease the rate of tumor progression in colorectal cancer. Two treatment
strategies will be tested: (1) direct applying ECM crosslinking agents in the tumor microenvironment; (2)
implanting genetically engineered fibroblasts secreting ECM crosslinking enzymes and other anti-cancer
biomolecules. Colorectal cancer mouse models will be used to evaluate the efficacy of the new treatments."

This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Tasce Bongiovanni, an acute care, trauma and surgical critical
care physician at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Bongiovanni is establishing herself as an
investigator in patient-oriented research using implementation science to prevent the prolonged use of pain
medications in older adults in the postoperative period. Although short-term use of opioid-sparing medications
may be appropriate for postoperative pain control, long-term use in older adults can lead to adverse events
including increased risk of hospitalization and death, and should be avoided.
However, a
shift towards
multimodal pain regimens driven by the opioid epidemic has taken place without attention to ensuring that
opioid-sparing medications are discontinued appropriately.
Since older adults account for roughly half of all
surgeries in the United States, a proportion expected to increase as the population rapidly ages, a deeper
understanding of prolonged use of opioid-sparing medication is an urgent public health concern.
The
objective of this K23 proposal is to better understand and address, via a targeted, evidence-based intervention,
prolonged used of postoperative pain medication in older adults. My central hypothesis is that continuation of
pain medication postoperatively is common in older adults, has worsened as surgeons shift to multimodal
regimens, and that this phenomenon is largely due to lack of communication and coordination between care
teams and patients. The aims of this proposal are: 1. In a nationally representative Medicare population, define
the epidemiology of prolonged use of pain medications prescribed postoperatively, including patient, clinician
and health system risk factors; 2. Conduct qualitative interviews with clinicians and older adult patients and
their caregivers to document experiences of prolonged use of pain medication in the postoperative period and
obtain feedback about a planned pilot intervention to address these issues and 3. Pilot an intervention to
prevent the prolonged use of postoperative pain medication for older adults after surgery. The aims of this
proposal are developed to directly support career development activities with a focus on training in 1.
Advanced statistical analysis, specifically of Medicare data; 2. Robust qualitative methodology; 3. Design and
evaluate effective implementation strategies for older adults and 4. Career development and leadership,
focused on surgery in older adults, with the long-term goal career goal to combine her clinical and research
interests to improve postoperative care and medication use in older adults. Dr. Bongiovanni will conduct this
work with an exceptional mentoring team, led by Dr. Steinman and embedded in the UCSF Pepper Center.
This K23 proposal will advance our knowledge of the risk factors and drivers of prolonged use of pain
medication in the postoperative period, and use this knowledge to design, refine and test the feasibility and
acceptability of an intervention to prevent prolonged use for older adults. It will also provide advanced research
skills and valuable data to launch Dr. Bongiovanni’s career as an independent investigator at the intersection of
surgery and aging. Together, the data and training plan will form the basis for a compelling R01 proposal to
improve postoperative care for older adults."
10890891,"Project Summary
Nerve damage is a common affliction that causes sensory and/or motor deficits. Recovery involves a
regenerative process in which damaged axons within a nerve fiber must re-extend to the appropriate target
tissues, in a process known as target-specific regeneration. This process often fails in humans, leaving patients
with chronic health problems. Improving clinical outcomes requires a better understanding of how target-specific
regeneration is regulated. We know that components of the nerve support scaffold can guide axon re-extension
along simple paths. However, when axons reach nerve branch points, they require more specific guidance
mechanisms to differentiate between multiple paths and select the correct one. We have little understanding of
what environmental cues guide these decisions, and how they are appropriately interpreted by regrowing axons.
The objective of this proposal is to identify cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate axon targeting
decisions to promote target-specific regeneration.
I have established the zebrafish vagus nerve as a model to elucidate mechanisms of target-specific axon
regeneration. Regenerating vagus axons select between five nerve branches to robustly re-innervate the correct
target tissue, although how they do so is not known. I hypothesize that two non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms
regulate target-specific regeneration: 1) chemosensation, in which a regenerating axon can interpret spatially
patterned chemical guidance cues in the environment that direct its growth; 2) fasciculation, in which a
regenerating axon can recognize undamaged axons that are innervating its intended target and use them as a
substrate for directed growth. The three aims of this proposal will comprehensively identify how growing axons
interact with their environment at the cell biological and molecular levels during target-specific regeneration. In
Aim 1, I will combine a novel single-cell chimera regeneration assay with live imaging and genetic and
pharmacological manipulations to establish a conceptual understanding of how in vivo axon-environment
interactions guide targeting decisions. In Aim 2, I will combine a novel method to label and isolate live neurons
based on their innervation target with in vivo and in vitro techniques to precisely measure how axons of each of
the five innervation target groups interact with other axons, and with chemical signals, in the environment. In Aim
3, I will combine innervation target-specific neuron isolation with RNAseq and mutant analysis for unbiased
identification of molecules that regulate target selection in each of the five innervation target groups. This study
will greatly enhance our fundamental understanding of how axons reinnervate their target tissues during
regeneration, and provide an important knowledge base to develop improved treatments for nerve damage."
10807959,"Smoking is the leading cause of preventable illness, disability, and death in the United States. The rate of
smoking is disproportionately higher among Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Unfortunately, smoking cessation efforts that are effective in the general population have shown limited
effectiveness in smokers with PTSD. The high smoking rate and difficulty with achieving abstinence indicate a
critical need to develop effective interventions for PTSD smokers. Our data indicate that negative affect and
trauma reminders are a significant antecedent of relapse for PTSD smokers. Further, despite evidence that
nicotine may exacerbate PTSD symptoms, many smokers with PTSD expect that smoking helps manage their
symptoms. In this context, an ideal strategy may be to combine evidence-based PTSD treatment with intensive
smoking cessation treatment to maximize quit rates in this at-risk population.
Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a well-established evidenced-based treatment for PTSD. We have
successfully developed a treatment manual that integrates CPT with guideline-concordant cognitive-behavioral
counseling for smoking cessation and is well-tolerated among Veterans with PTSD who smoke cigarettes. The
addition of more intensive smoking cessation treatment is expected to maximize quit rates in this population.
Contingency management (CM) is an intensive behavioral treatment that has demonstrated efficacy for
reducing smoking in a range of difficult-to-treat populations, including individuals with psychiatric disorders. CM
provides positive reinforcers (e.g., vouchers, money) to individuals misusing substances contingent upon
bioverified abstinence from drug use. In combination with other treatment, CM may provide a potent initial
incentive in smokers who experience difficulties early in the quit attempt. The primary goal of the current study
is to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention that combines clinic-based CM using twice weekly monitoring with
salivary cotinine test strips, cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation counseling, smoking cessation medication,
and evidence-based PTSD treatment. Proposed is a randomized, two-arm clinical trial in which 120 Veteran
smokers with PTSD will be randomized to either: 1) COGNITIVE PROCESSING THERAPY with SMOKING
ABSTINENCE REINFORCEMENT THERAPY (CPT-SMART) – an intervention that combines evidenced-
based PTSD treatment with guideline-concordant cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation counseling,
bupropion, and intensive behavioral therapy through CM; or 2) COMBINED CONTACT CONTROL: an
intervention identical to CPT-SMART in PTSD and smoking treatment, except for using non-contingent
payment (i.e., yoked CM) to control for compensation and monitoring.
Specific aims include: AIM 1) To evaluate the efficacy of CPT-SMART on rates of short- and long-term
abstinence from cigarettes (assessed with multiple measures including bioverified abstinence) measured at 1-
week post-treatment, 3-months, and 6 months; AIM 2) To evaluate the impact of CPT-SMART on treatment
engagement and utilization; and an EXPLORATORY AIM) To explore mechanisms of CPT-SMART on long-
term smoking abstinence, including self-efficacy, salience of smoking, and psychiatric symptom reduction. The
VA has already implemented CM for treatment of substance abuse. If shown efficacious, a combined PTSD
treatment plus incentive-based approaches for smoking could be implemented into specialty PTSD programs.
The positive public health impact of reducing smoking among Veterans with PTSD could be enormous as it
would prevent significant smoking-related morbidity and mortality."

10805111,"Prostate cancer (PC) that recurs following standard of care androgen-deprivation therapy is termed
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and is currently incurable. CRPC is marked by reactivation of
androgen receptor (AR) signaling, eventual metastasis and, in some cases, further evolution to AR null/AR
indifferent neuroendocrine PC (NEPC). BUB1B (BUBR1) is a master regulator of a seven gene network that is
upregulated in and drives CRPC. BUB1B is overexpressed in PC compared to benign prostate tissue and is
further elevated in metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) and NEPC. BUB1B is an essential component of the spindle
assembly checkpoint (SAC) and aberrant BUB1B expression has been associated with development of several
cancers; however, its role in PC remains understudied and there are no drug-like inhibitors available.
 Depletion of BUB1B halts AR+ and AR- CRPC cell proliferation. Furthermore, ectopic BUB1B expression in
the less aggressive predecessor of CRPC, androgen dependent (AD) PC, is sufficient to confer castration
resistance. Expression of constitutively active AR variants (AR-Vs) is one mechanism underlying progression
to CRPC and clinical resistance to 2nd generation AR antagonists such as enzalutamide. In CRPC cells,
BUB1B knockdown decreased AR and constitutively active AR-V protein stability leading to decreased ligand-
independent AR transcriptional activity, which is a driver of most CRPC and metastatic CRPC. Thus, BUB1B is
a promising therapeutic target for CRPC including, but not restricted to, currently intractable constitutively
active AR-V expressing tumors.
 This proposal will test the hypotheses that: (1) BUB1B kinase activity is essential for progression to lethal
CRPC by increasing AR / AR-V levels, which can drive CRPC; (2) in AR null/AR indifferent NEPC, BUB1B
promotes growth through yet to be defined AR-independent mechanisms; and (3) BUB1B represents a
promising but untapped therapeutic vulnerability that can be exploited for treating deadly CRPC and NEPC.
Aim 1 will evaluate the mechanisms underlying BUB1B kinase growth-promoting effects in CRPC and NEPC
and will determine the requirement for BUB1B kinase activity in stabilizing AR/AR-V7 as well as explore
mechanisms of BUB1B promotion of CRPC and NEPC. BUB1B protein will be evaluated in TMAs containing
bone and visceral metastasis, which will be useful for future patient stratification. Aim 2 will establish BUB1B as
a tractable druggable target by evaluating and prioritizing recently identified small molecule inhibitors that
target the BUB1B kinase domain at the ATP binding site. A NanoBRET assay will be developed for BUB1B
drug optimization and advancement. Aim 3 will develop, characterize, and evaluate drug-like potent and
selective small molecule BUB1B kinase inhibitors. Preliminary data support the proposed use of a highly
scalable and innovative computational screening pipeline that integrates AI-based kinase activity predictions,
protein homology modeling, and physics-based molecular simulations to identify and prioritize BUB1B
inhibitors. Structure-activity relationships (SAR) and optimization of at least one identified BUB1B inhibitor
series using biochemical and kinome-wide activity profiling assays will be conducted. The therapeutic efficacy
of BUB1B inhibitors will be evaluated in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft explant cultures representing
the heterogeneity of the human disease.
 The multidisciplinary team with deep expertise in PC biology and experimental therapeutics, structure-
based computational screening and medicinal chemistry will focus on the mitotic kinase BUB1B, which
represents a promising therapeutic vulnerability in lethal PC. This proposal will elucidate mechanisms of
BUB1B action in lethal CRPC and NEPC and develop drug-like potent selective small molecule BUB1B
inhibitors through sophisticated deep neural network multi-task (DNNMT) predictors coupled with biochemical
assays and test the most promising compounds in robust CRPC and NEPC patient-derived models."
10805220,"Atypical left atrial flutter (ALAF) is a relatively stable arrhythmia commonly seen in patients after they have
undergone ablation for atrial fibrillation. ALAF can be difficult to rate control and frequently requires another
ablation. These require extensive mapping to delineate the circuit; there may even be undetectable latent
circuits that arise after ablating the dominant one. Mapping is further complicated by very low voltages due to
extensive existing scar, making correct local activation time determination very difficult. At times the only
solution can be treatment by atrio-ventricular (AV) node ablation and pacemaker implant. ALAF is set up
around scar regions in the left atrium. We propose a novel, multidisciplinary approach to managing ALAF in
these difficult cases using personalized computational modeling of atrial flutter to guide ablation. Within our
atrial arrhythmia group, we have pioneered the use of MRI for measuring atrial structure and scar, developed a
wide range of experimental approaches to extend mechanisms of electrophysiology, and applied state-of-the-
art scientific computing, all based on highly integrated local resources. We will apply this multidisciplinary
expertise to improve the understanding and outcomes of post-ablation ALAF. To achieve this goal, we will (1)
use the scar information to make personalized computational models of atrial flutter to identify circuits and
provide guidance to ablation, (2) improve MRI segmentation and thresholding accuracy to determine post-
ablation scar in patients and (3) use the post ablation MRI and outcomes to determine the mechanistic
underpinnings of procedural success and failure in patients who undergo computational model guided ablation
for ALAF at the Salt Lake VA. Left atrial late gadolinium enhancement techniques will be improved to acquire
isotropic images. Machine learning will be used in our extensive database of thousands of left atrial MRIs at
the Salt Lake VA and the Univ of Utah and hundreds of ALAF cases to develop a faster and more accurate
segmentation and thresholding technique. Computational model will be used to carry out virtual
electrophysiology studies to induce flutter with the goal of identifying all the flutter circuits. Further simulations
will be used to test ablation strategies to eliminate all possible left atrial flutters. Our preliminary studies support
these goals by achieving successful prediction of arrhythmias from computational models, at times better than
the most advanced mapping techniques. The result of this project will be a generalized computational model of
ALAF, which can be personalized with left atrial geometry, scar pattern, and mapping results. Such a model
will enable virtual electrophysiology studies leading to the prediction of ablation points to terminate all possible
ALAF pathways. If successful this will lead to improving outcomes, reducing the need for repeat ablations that
have significant cost and risks associated with them and possibly even avoid doing AV node ablations."
10805232,"The healing of ~10% of several million traumatic or nontraumatic fractures occurring annually in the US is
delayed or impaired resulting in nonunion or delayed union. The annual cost for their treatment and management
exceeds $20 billion, leading to considerable healthcare costs and human suffering. A good understanding of the
mechanism of fracture healing is critical for the development and proper use of novel and effective therapies.
Fracture healing is a complex and dynamic process with osteoclasts and osteoblasts playing indispensable roles.
The critical core of fracture healing is the callus remodeling, which is initiated with resorption of the cartilaginous
callus followed by the coupled formation of bony callus that subsequently is remodeled to cortical bone
indistinguishable from the native bone. The osteoclastic regulation of the local coupled bone formation is in part
mediated through local release of osteoclastic soluble osteoanabolic factors and is an integral regulatory
mechanism of callus remodeling. This study tests two specific hypotheses that are relevant to the osteoclastic
regulation of local bone formation/regeneration: Hypothesis 1. Local injections of osteoclastic microvesicles (MV)
into fractures accelerates the healing of skeletal fractures by accelerating fracture callus formation and
remodeling. This hypothesis is supported by the following preliminary findings: 1) osteoclasts released soluble
MV that have pro-osteogenic, pro-chondrogenic, and pro-angiogenic activities, 2) injections of osteoclastic MV
at the surface of calvaria stimulated local bone formation, and 3) injections of MV into fractures promoted neo-
angiogenesis in fracture callus and accelerated fracture healing. Hypothesis 2. EfnB2 is a key osteoanabolic
component of osteoclastic MV and is in part responsible for the osteoanabolic actions of osteoclastic MV.
Accordingly, a review of current literature and the following preliminary data suggest that EfnB2 is an attractive
candidate of an osteoanabolic component of osteoclastic MV: 1) osteoclastic MV contains appreciable amounts
of EfnB2, 2) pretreatment of MV with anti-EfnB2 antibody abrogated its osteogenic activity, 3) EfnB2-deficient
MV had reduced osteogenic and fracture healing activities, whereas MV from osteoclasts overexpressing EfnB2
showed greater osteoanabolic activity, 4) pretreatment of osteoprogenitors with anti-EphB4 antibody prevented
osteoclastic MV to exert its osteogenic activity. Aim 1 tests Hypothesis 1 by using a simple transverse femoral
fracture model to determine: a) an optimal injection regimen for osteoclastic MV by determining the duration-of-
stay of the MV after local injection at fracture site, optimal injection frequency, duration between injections, and
optimal dose range; b) if an optimized injection regimen of osteoclastic MV would accelerate bony bridging of
fracture gaps and increase torsional mechanical strength of fractured bones in male as well as female mice; and
c) the cellular mechanism by which osteoclastic MV accelerates fracture healing through histological and
immunohistochemical analyses of time-dependent effects of the MV treatment on osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and
chondrocytes during the various fracture healing phases. Aim 2 tests Hypothesis 2 by determining: a) if treatment
of osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and endothelial cells with osteoclastic MV in vitro upregulates their EphB4 forward
signaling; b) if MV of EfnB2-deficient osteoclasts would show diminished osteogenic, chondrogenic, and
angiogenic activities of osteoclastic MV in vitro; c) if MV of osteoclasts with EfnB2 overexpression exhibited
enhanced chondrogenic, and angiogenic activities in vitro; d) if osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and endothelial cells
isolated from EphB4-deficient mice show reduced osteogenic, chondrogenic, and angiogenic in response to
osteoclastic MV in vitro; and e) if local injections of MV deficient in EfnB2 impedes, and local injections of MV
with EfnB2 overexpression accelerates, fracture healing. If successful, this study could offer key mechanistic
insights into how osteoclasts regulate local bone regeneration. It may also help to develop novel osteoclastic
MV-based therapies for fracture healing and local bone regeneration."
10806312,"Spasticity is a debilitating condition in people with upper motor neuron disorders that interferes
with an individual’s activities of daily living and sleep. Spasticity can lead to loss of body control
and balance resulting in falls, pressure injury of the skin, contractures, and pain. Spasticity hinders
the ability to functionally use voluntary muscle contraction; thus, limiting body transfers,
ambulation, and exercise. Despite the negative impact of spasticity in people with spinal cord
injury (SCI), the available tools to manage spasticity and overcome functional deficits are limited.
Oral medications are typically prescribed at the start of treatment due to its ease of administration;
however, they may induce significant side effects including drowsiness and muscle weakness,
and their effectiveness is sensitive to dosing fluctuations. Neurosurgery can treat severe
spasticity, but it carries surgical risks, and the long-term benefits vary across individuals.
 Manual therapy and leg stretching are primary treatments for a large subset of people with
spasticity, which is usually performed by caregivers and nurses with relatively low adverse effects.
Manual stretching can provide relief from muscle spasms, decrease joint stiffness, normalize
muscle tone, reduce pain, and improve range of motion. However, providing on-demand, reliable
manual limb stretching is caregiver intensive and imposes a heavy burden on nurses in hospitals
and caregivers at veterans’ homes. COVID-19 has exacerbated difficulties in receiving manual
stretching to manage spasticity by limiting physical assistance in veterans with SCI due to family
visit restrictions and staffing shortages. Moreover, existing devices used to mitigate spasticity
such as passive stretchers, casts and night splinters do not fully conform to the user's body and
are typically bulky and lack versatility to customize the forces applied to the user. People wearing
them may feel discomfort, weakness, or pain, and even experience pressure sores.
 Our long-term research goal is to develop novel, non-invasive rehabilitation strategies
addressing the debilitating effects of spasticity, which can play an integral role in improving quality
of life and independence in persons with upper motor neuron injury. This feasibility study will
establish preliminary evidence for the development of a novel wearable, portable leg exoskeleton
capable of providing leg stretching - similar to the manual stretching provided by caregivers. The
objectives in this project are to 1) integrate a wearable exoskeleton and its closed-loop control
algorithm to provide strategic joint forces to assist dynamic leg stretching; and 2) evaluate the
stretching approach in 10 veterans with spasticity to establish safety, acceptability, ease of use,
and user satisfaction. Our central hypothesis is that the intelligent velocity control of the wearable
device can apply safe forces about the hip and knee joints to yield safe, automated stretching as
needed in veterans with spasticity. The control algorithm enables leg stretching while veterans lie
on a bed (supine position with their knee extended) and sit down (with their knee flexed) with
customized stretching rates to account for differences in range of motion across participants.
Questionnaires are used to collect veteran’s and clinician’s feedback on the device performance.
 This study contributes to advancing non-invasive, non-pharmacological tools to manage
spasticity by establishing the feasibility of the wearable stretching device in veterans with SCI.
The project can lead to a customized, on-demand tool for the clinic and home, which can alleviate
the burden on caregivers, aid quantifying the long-term effects of stretching using clinical and
functional measures, and facilitate the integration of the device with other treatment modalities."

Among

Approximately 13% of African Americans and 25% of West Africans carry high risk renal genotypes,
comprising of any combination of the two APOL1 risk variants, G1 and G2.
 This re-submission for a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases Patient-Oriented
Research Career Development Award (K23) seeks to support Dr. Titilayo Ilori, an Assistant Professor at the
Boston University School of Medicine, who wants to build a career focused on mechanistic and interventional
studies on the effect of dietary factors and lifestyle on CKD incidence and progression in both low- and
adequately-resourced settings, especially in the context of genetic and genomic risk variants. Dr. Ilori's prior
research has focused on health disparities in CKD and secondary data analysis of nutrition-related exposures
and outcomes in kidney disease. Dr. Ilori intends to extend the scope of her research towards designing
prospective studies to study the role of dietary sodium and potassium in CKD progression and APOL1
Nephropathy in Africans. Accordingly, her K23 training is focused on acquiring skills in global health research,
nutritional and genetic epidemiology in CKD, statistical genetics and advanced biostatistics skills in longitudinal
data analysis, and biomarkers of CKD.
 We propose a research project that leverages the Human Hereditary and Health in Africa Kidney Disease
Research Network and addresses the following research aims: 1) a cross-sectional and prospective
examination of the associations of dietary sodium, potassium, and oxalate intake – assessed through 24h urine
collections in Africans; 2) a cross-sectional and prospective study to determine the associations of dietary
patterns with CKD and CKD progression; 3) diet:gene interaction studies to examine whether dietary factors
(sodium, potassium, oxalate, or dietary patterns) modify the effect of association of APOL1 renal genotypes on
CKD progression. This is an important project because it may identify if dietary factors are modifiable risk
factors for CKD progressions in Africans in SSA, where the cost of dialysis and renal transplantation is
prohibitive. Additionally, evidence that diet alters the risk of nephropathy in those with high-risk APOL1 renal
risk alleles could be important in investigating new therapeutic targets for APOL1 Nephropathy.

10808898,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Food allergy has been implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the causative
role of food allergy in brain dysfunction has been debated, largely due to insufficient pathological evidence and
clear underlying mechanisms. Using animal models of food allergy, we and others provided supportive evidence
linking food allergy and brain dysfunction by demonstrating that inducing food allergy in otherwise healthy mice
resulted in behavior changes associated with neuroinflammation and altered neural activities. We have found
that C57BL/6J mice sensitized to a bovine whey allergen, β-lactoglobulin (BLG, Bos 5 d), do not exhibit overt
anaphylactic reactions upon acute allergen challenge but showed anxiety-like and depression-like behavior one
day after with elevated plasma levels of allergen-specific IgE and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. These
observations indicated that allergy-induced immune responses are still present in sensitized individuals even in
the absence of apparent allergic reactions. Taking advantage of this mouse model of non-anaphylactic cow’s
milk allergy (CMA), we subjected BLG-sensitized mice to a repeated allergen exposure regimen by placing them
on a whey-containing diet for 2 weeks to simulate frequent allergen consumption by individuals with subclinical
reactions. Although no evidence of anaphylaxis or food aversion was detected in the allergen-fed mice, we
observed profound cortical demyelination as well as increased blood-brain permeability, perivascular astrocyte
hypertrophy, and immune cell presence in their brains associated with significant depression-like behavior.
Furthermore, the systemic levels of allergen-specific IgE and other inflammatory mediators remained elevated
in these mice. Thus, we hypothesize that CMA-induced cortical demyelination and other neuropathologies result
from neuroinflammation orchestrated by sustained activities of brain-infiltrating leukocytes due to repeated
allergen exposure. In this project, we will first assess whether sensory, motor, and/or cognitive functions are also
affected by the CMA-associated demyelination and neuroinflammatory changes in the brain and whether
removing the allergen from the diet reverses the changes in the brain and behavior (Aim 1). We will then
investigate the involvement of allergen-stimulated immune cells in the development of neuropathologies by
clarifying their role in mediating the peripheral allergic insult to the brain (Aim 2). Finally, we will test whether
pharmacological protection of the intestinal barrier prevents aberrant allergen entry during food consumption and
reduces CMA-induced neuropathologies (Aim 3). The outcomes of this study will fill our knowledge gaps in the
mechanism involved in peripheral-to-central communication and clarify the adverse effects of allergy-mediated
chronic inflammation on brain function, prompting early allergy detection to prevent brain dysfunction."
10899533,"Abstract:
There are almost 500,000 deaths worldwide each year caused by rupture of intracranial aneurysms (IAs)
with half the victims younger than age 50. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) can be treated by
endovascular and microsurgical interventions to prevent rupture, however, the treatment carries a non-
negligible risk of morbidity (5%–7%) and mortality (1%–2%). Current guidelines recommend intervention for
UIAs larger than 7mm, when their rupture risk is higher than the intervention risk. However, more than 50%
of ruptured IAs are smaller than 7mm. Identifying small aneurysms that are prone to rupture and performing
selective intervention can potentially prevent rupture of these small aneurysms. A recent meta-analysis
including more than 4000 UIAs with an average of 4 years’ follow-up showed aneurysms that grew during
the follow-up were 30 times more likely to rupture than the non-growing aneurysms (3.1% vs. 0.1%).
Identifying the factors that predict aneurysm growth can help select these high risk UIAs for treatment.
Aneurysm wall enhancement (a surrogate marker of inflammation, identified by contrast-enhanced vessel
wall MRI) and aneurysm geometric factors (such as shape or size ratio as identified on imaging) are two
promising markers that may predict aneurysm growth. However, the current evaluation of these factors is
limited by non-optimized imaging techniques that have flow artifacts, long scan time and subjective,
qualitative image analysis. This project will develop optimally accelerated and blood suppressed imaging
methods and quantitative image analysis methods for the evaluation of UIA wall enhancement and geometric
characteristics, and investigate the parameters associated with aneurysm volume growth by longitudinal UIA
evaluation using MRI. First, we will develop and optimize blood suppression and imaging acceleration
techniques using in vitro phantoms and in vivo testing in patients. Second, we will develop automatic
segmentation and quantification methods (Radiomics) for evaluating UIA wall enhancement and geometry.
Finally, we will follow 200 patients with >3mm UIAs using MRI each year for up to 4 years, and investigate
which clinical and quantitative imaging parameters are predictive of UIA volume growth."
10795853,"Project Summary/Abstract
Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 29 million globally. While the majority of individuals
experience mild symptoms, the presence of obesity among other factors identifies a particularly high-risk group
of individuals for development of severe COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by exuberant
inflammation and vascular dysfunction, but long-term cardiovascular effects remain unclear. We hypothesize
that COVID-19 infection has widespread and long-lasting deleterious effects on endothelial function, including
molecular pathways of cellular senescence and inflammation among obese individuals. We propose to
prospectively study 100 obese and non-obese individuals with history of COVID-19 infection and 50 age- and
sex-matched controls. To gain further insights into underlying mechanisms of vascular dysfunction, we will
pursue three related lines of investigation: In Aim 1, we will study the effect of COVID-19 across vascular beds
including peripheral and coronary microvascular function. In Aim 2, we will investigate the association of
COVID-19 and molecular pathways of endothelial activation and senescence using circulating proteomic
profiling, gene expression profiling of freshly isolated human endothelial cells, complemented by interrogation
of targeted endothelial pathways. In Aim 3, we will conduct a prospective longitudinal observational study to
examine the effect of COVID-19 on trajectories of peripheral and coronary microvascular function and
endothelial phenotype over the course of 6 months. This proposal leverages a unique and highly experienced
multidisciplinary team of investigators with expertise in obesity-related cardiovascular disease, endothelial and
aging biology, coronary microvascular dysfunction, and bioinformatics. Importantly, our investigative team has
a track record of successfully enrolling minority participants across two medical centers. With a
disproportionate burden of severe COVID-19 among racial and ethnic minority groups, we will be uniquely
positioned to examine race/ethnic differences in exploratory analyses. These studies have the potential to
provide important insights into mechanisms driving endothelial inflammation and cardiovascular consequences
of COVID-19 among obese individuals and will lay the foundation for future studies focused on long-term
cardiovascular complications and therapeutic strategies."
10793040,"There are more than 1.8 million percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) performed annually to treat coronary
artery stenosis. Stent thrombosis is a catastrophic mechanism for stent failure, comprising 11% of cases of acute
myocardial infarction, and carries a high morbidity and mortality; its prevention requires the use of prolonged
dual antiplatelet therapy, which significantly increases bleeding risk, rendering PCI therapy of prohibitively high
risk in certain patients. This is particularly true with co-existing conditions, such as atrial fibrillation, which
comprises 5% of PCI patients and requires additional anticoagulant therapy to prevent left atrial thrombi. Yet, a
contemporary stent system that provides local antiplatelet activity, obviating the need for systemic therapy to
mitigate bleeding risk, does not exist.
To fill this urgent unmet need, we have developed such a stent: the ticagrelor coated stent (TCS). The TCS is
coated with the potent antiplatelet agent ticagrelor, utilizing a self-assembled monolayer. We have established
in vitro proof of concept for this new stent platform. We also implanted the TCS in rabbits for up to 35 days and
demonstrated superior performance in comparison with standard non-coated stents. In a recent porcine ex vivo
AV fistula model, we demonstrated widely patent TCS with no thrombus, minimal platelet activation and
adherence, and a marked decrease in inflammation, in comparison to control stents. Thus, the TCS provides
local antiplatelet activity to not only prevent stent thrombosis, but also to minimize bleeding risk by eliminating
the need for systemic dual antiplatelet therapy. Moreover, this stent is expected to provide a safe
revascularization option for patients who have limited access to or who are unable to take daily medications.
Given our promising preliminary data, we are now poised to move forward with a detailed chemical
characterization of the TCS and safety testing in porcine coronary artery implant studies, to further assess safety,
prior to potential clinical translation. We have divided the proposed work into the following three Specific Aims:
(1) precise measurement of drug concentration per TCS area pre- and post-implantation, TCS shelf life and
stability, using mass spectroscopy and UV spectroscopy techniques; (2) assessment of platelet activity and
inflammation in a porcine ex vivo model as measured by scanning electron microscopy, confocal microscopy,
and histopathology; (3) safety of stent implantation assessed in porcine survival studies at 7, 28, and 180 days
and a head-to-head comparison with industry standard coronary drug eluting stents. Safety testing in our porcine
groups will serve as the framework to translate our work to human subjects."

In this proposal we will deploy state-of-the-art neural ensemble recordings across the reach and saccadic-
attention cortices of NHP performing coordinated reach-and-saccade movements to test hypotheses about the
multiregional brain mechanisms supporting coordinated visual behavior. There is growing evidence that an
important way to conceptualize the behavioral significance of multiregional brain dynamics is as communication
channels that mediate information transmission between sender brain regions and receiver brain regions. The
communication channel allows populations of neurons in a sender region to dynamically influence the activity of
populations of neurons in a receiver region and support behavioral flexibility. We

seek to test the communication
model of multiregional communication by asking how the model explains neural i nteractions between
 neurons in the saccade and reach regions that must communicate during coordinated visual behavior. We
 specifically investigate multiregional communication during behaviors in which visual fixation enhances
reach and saccade movement performance.One way to demonstrate the importance of fixation to
accurate reaching is to present a second target around the time of a coordinated look and reach or pointing
movement, and instruct subjects to acquire the newly-presented target with a new saccadic eye movement. This
sequence of two movements, the coordinated look-and-reach movement and the subsequent saccadic eye
movement, reveals that the importance of target foveation to accurate reaching extends beyond the act of
fixation. Accurate coordinated looking and reaching features a form of attentional suppression that inhibits
saccades to newly-presented targets. As a result, gaze is said to be temporarily anchored to the target of the
coordinated reach and, importantly, the longer the duration of fixation is extended, the more accurate the reach
movement. Gaze anchoring therefore provides an opportunity to investigate the multiregional mechanisms of a
flexible behavior in terms of communication between at least two separate systems in the brain - the reach
system that controls the reach and the saccade system that is inhibited to suppress new saccades. We will first
do experiments to test and elaborate the conceptual framework of communication channels for multiregional
communication during gaze anchoring. Aims 1 and 2 will test complementary hypotheses involving subspaces
and neural coherence for how communication between reach and saccadic-attentional cortex gives rise to
coordinated behavioral performance. In Aim 3, we will then more closely examine the cognitive processes in play
and select between alternative explanations for how coordinated visual behavior depends on attention. These
experiments will advance understanding of how channel gain and modulation combine in the mechanisms of
multiregional communication, will lead to new strategies for neural rehabilitation and neural prosthetic systems."

Thermoregulation is controlled in the CNS where peripheral thermal information is integrated and
thermoregulatory responses are activated. The core thermoregulatory network comprises the lateral
parabrachial nucleus, the preoptic area, the dorsomedial hypothalamus and the rostral raphe pallidus and is
involved in the most mechanisms of adaptive thermoregulation and in the fever response. The thermoregulatory
mechanisms activated during extreme heat exposure, when core body temperature (CBT) reaches 40.5 C or
more, are not fully understood. We have identified brain regions that are specifically activated only in such
conditions and our preliminary data indicate that these neurons are thermosensitive and are projecting to preoptic
thermoregulatory neurons. Our preliminary studies have also revealed that activation of these population of
neurons induces a potent hypothermia. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that a specific population
of neurons are activated at high core body temperature and that they stimulate downstream thermoregulatory
preoptic neurons triggering heat loss mechanisms. In Specific Aim 1 we will identify, using genetic tools, the
neurons activated during heat stress and characterize their physiological and neurochemical properties. In
Specific Aim 2 we will study using transgenic models, viral vectors and optogenetics the network connectivity of
these neurons and their role in thermoregulation. By employing pharmacological tools, electrophysiology and
transgenic models we will then study the ion channels involved in the thermosensitive firing of the neurons
activated at high CBT and will determine their role in thermoregulation (Specific Aim 3). Studying the
thermoregulatory neuronal networks and cellular mechanisms activated by extreme heat exposure may lead to
better therapies for heat stroke and provide central pharmacological targets for the development of hypothermic
agents."

 Exposure to discrimination-related stressors (e.g., racial/ethnic discrimination, unfair treatment) continues
to pose a public health challenge to minority populations as a social determinant of health. Although
discrimination-related stressors have been consistently associated with poor mental health outcomes, there is
a critical need to identify mechanisms and malleable risk/protective factors to integrate in the design of
community and clinical interventions. The overall objective of this R01 application is to investigate mediators
and moderators at multiple ecological (individual, family/peer and school/neighborhood levels) and time-scale
(micro- and macro-time) levels in the link between discrimination-related stressors and mental health among
340 Mexican-origin youth. Guided by a socioecological, life course perspective, the proposed project has three
specific aims: (1) determine within-person discrimination-related stressors that impact Mexican-American origin
youth’s mental health outcomes as well as the mechanisms of action at both micro- and macro-time levels; (2)
identify protective factors that could help youth to successfully cope with discrimination-related stressors and the
conditions under which those protective factors work; and (3) elucidate the youth, parent, and neighborhood
risk factors that moderate the link between discrimination-related stressors and mental health in youth.
 The project’s long-term goal is to improve the mental health of Mexican-origin youth by reducing the
deleterious effects of racism, “othering,” and negative neighborhood interactions. The central hypothesis is that
this link will be mediated by cognitive and/or affective mechanisms (i.e. anger, hypervigilance, emotion
regulation, low social position as threats to self-worth) and moderated by coping resources (parental
adaptation and racial socialization) and family, peer, and neighborhood supports, thus representing multiple
ecological levels. Community-based collaboration will help ensure recruitment of the targeted sample of
Mexican-origin adolescents, mothers, and fathers; the inclusion of fathers will be a valuable contribution to the
literature, given the dearth of studies on Latinx fathers/stepfathers. Through the innovative integration of both
yearly longitudinal (macro-time) and daily diary (micro-time) research design features, important questions
about how mediating and moderating processes unfold over time will be addressed. The proposed analyses
also reflect the multi-layered sociocultural niches occupied by Latinx adolescents by employing individual-level
methods as well as dyadic (adolescent-mother; adolescent-father) and triadic (adolescent-mother-father)
analyses to test key study hypotheses. Considering the current growth of Latinx immigrants, it is imperative to
test a socioecological model of risk and resilience for Mexican-origin adolescents that is responsive to both
their immediate context and the larger global forces around migration. This research is highly translational in
that it will facilitate the development of more effective, culturally sensitive prevention and intervention strategies
for Latinx youth and their families."
10795789,"ABSTRACT
There is a consensus that chronic pain is a widespread major health problem and that development of better
drugs is needed to address this unmet need and combat the opioid abuse crisis. The pain crisis is particularly
burdensome for patients with severe pain, many of whom are on opioids, and have failed all other measures.
These patients may be candidates for a simple, but elegant alternative, namely intrathecal (IT) drug delivery
using an FDA approved fully implantable pump. The dose level with IT delivery is orders of magnitude less
than what is required for systemic delivery which greatly improves the safety margin. The FDA has approved
only two pain drugs for these micro-infusion devices, morphine and ziconotide. Though helpful in many
patients, side effects, safety issues, and inadequate efficacy limit their use. CNTX-3001 is a novel, non-opioid,
highly potent (picomolar Ki and EC50), highly selective small molecule agonist of the nociceptin receptor
(NOPr). Preclinical data in multiple species, including non-human primates, indicate that NOPr agonists are
powerful analgesics when delivered directly to the spinal cord by IT administration. The goal of this proposal is
to develop CNTX-3001 by conducting IND-enabling studies and a first-in-human Phase 1 trial. To be effective,
NOPr agonists must be applied directly to the region of the spinal cord because activation of brain NOPr
receptors may enhance pain. By contrast, IT NOPr agonists show no behavioral side effects at therapeutic
dose levels in preclinical studies (including non-human primates). CNTX-3001 possesses favorable
physiochemical properties for IT delivery, including an ideal balance of water solubility (for delivery to CSF) and
lipid solubility (for local distribution into the spinal cord). When delivered via bolus to the lumbar spinal cord of
rats, CNTX-3001 is powerfully analgesic with efficacy and behavioral side effect profiles superior to the gold-
standard FDA-approved option, IT morphine. The goal will be to develop CNTX-3001 for chronic IT delivery
using an approved pump. This grant will allow us to scale up production of drug substance (DS), undertake
formulation development, and run stability studies to ensure a stable drug product (DP) for IT delivery. We will
produce GMP-grade DS and DP and run non-GLP and GLP toxicity studies in two preclinical species. Data
from these studies will lead to a Phase 1 study evaluating tolerability and efficacy in patients with intractable
chronic low back pain (IT delivery is not appropriate for healthy volunteers). Results from this grant will lay the
groundwork for further clinical development (Phase 2 and 3 trials) using implantable pumps for continuous
delivery of CNTX-3001. We believe that Centrexion's IT drug candidate, CNTX-3001, has the capacity to
revolutionize management of severe pain in patients with few or no other options."

Despite the Healthy People 2020 goal of 70.5%, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in Federally Qualified
Health Centers (FQHCs) are about 40%. The proposed study seeks to address this disparity and accelerate
the adoption of effective cancer prevention and control screening practices to promote CRC screening.
Leveraging our established community-academic network, which emphasizes participatory approaches among
community, clinical, and academic stakeholders, we build on our extensive preparatory research that tested a
low-literacy educational intervention plus Fecal Immunochemical Test [FIT]), and which resulted in initial
screening rates of 80%. This work was primarily carried-out in urban-based settings. Prior research shows that
repeat FIT screening rates often drop significantly without intervention and that there are notable geographic-
related CRC disparities with higher mortality seen among individuals in rural areas. Additional research is
needed to address repeat screening and expand our reach to other at-risk and rural populations. Informed by
a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework and enriched by implementation science
approaches, CARES-REACH features a stepped wedge design with extension for maintenance to support an
implementation strategy focused on multiple levels: organizational, provider, and patient level that entail
processes to boost initial and repeat screening among average risk and age-eligible adults. This multilevel
study entails implementation of a core set of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) that include: low literacy
patient education (English, Spanish, and Haitian Creole language); provider education, system-wide electronic
medical record (EMR) tools and prompts, and FIT distribution plus an organization-wide cancer control
champion who motivates providers, navigates patients, and monitors system-wide screening activities.
Specific aims are to: 1) implement an organization-wide multilevel CRC intervention using EBIs plus a cancer
control champion in FQHCs located in rural and urban Central and Southwest Florida; 2) explore whether
practice setting and population characteristics may differentially impact annual clinic CRC uniform Data system
(UDS) screening rates; and 3) conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the implementation process (facilitators
and impediments), resource requirements, and intermediate patient outcomes for the program in FQHC
organizations. The intervention will be rolled out in a stepwise-method across clinics: one group of clinics
receives early intervention roll-out and the other clinics are delayed to allow for rigorous comparison. The main
outcome is change in annual clinic CRC screening rates compared to CRC screening rates of the prior year for
each clinic as well as comparing screening rates among early roll-out clinics vs. delayed roll-out clinics.
Addressing implementation processes will guide and direct scale-up to other FQHCs and community health
systems."

Publicly-funded cancer clinical trials continue to establish new standards of care and improve
outcomes for cancer patients. ECOG-ACRIN (EA) has instituted an organizational matrix based
on the integration of biological and imaging studies with clinical trials of novel anti-cancer
therapies to conduct cutting-edge clinical research and promote scientific discovery. We have
incorporated expertise in imaging, cancer biology and therapy within our scientific organization,
working closely with the biostatistics and data management centers at the Dana Farber Cancer
Institute and Brown University, to propose a research plan that recognizes the importance of
biomarkers to bring precisely targeted clinical trials to broad populations of cancer patients. The
EA biorepositories, image databases, immunological laboratories, and associated translational
science centers will bring together the correlative science studies that relate cancer biology to
clinical markers of treatment effect in a data-rich environment. EA embraces the goals and spirit
of the NCTN to conduct science-driven clinical trials to improve the lives of adults with cancer.
EA clinical trials are implemented through an efficient operational infrastructure that enables
access to cutting-edge treatments across the US from large cancer centers to community
practices and assures accrual to complex trials in cancers of varying prevalence. Our science
is driven by our membership, which includes the NCI-funded Cancer Centers, the Specialized
Programs of Research Excellence (SPOREs), the ETCTN (Experimental Therapeutics Clinical
Trials Network), the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN), the NCTN Lead Academic Participating
Sites (LAPS), and the National Community Oncology Research Programs (NCORP). As
committed participants in the NCTN and in all aspects of CTEP-led cancer research, EA
collaborates across the system to promote and advance the collective efforts of all of the groups.
We make available the mentorship and opportunity needed to nourish the next generation of
investigators. EA is positioned to make unique contributions to the NCTN, working to translate
NCI-supported science into improved outcomes for cancer patients. This model, together with
developing innovation in large data analysis, will yield high quality trials that have the potential to
be practice-changing, applicable to both academic and community environments, and providing
imaging and other biomarkers to identify patients who benefit most."
10796910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Many things happen at once - there are always abundant stimuli to be perceived, items to
be remembered, and courses of action to be planned. While considerable research has
explored how our brains screen out the onslaught, we know less about how information about
multiple stimuli is preserved despite limitations in neural processing capacity. This proposal
explores potential brain mechanisms that may play a role in such information preservation.
 We recently found evidence that neural populations contain fluctuating activity patterns:
some neurons alternate between encoding one stimulus and encoding another on a sub-second
to second time scale. We now seek to understand the organizing principles through which such
fluctuating activity patterns serve to preserve and/or select information. Specifically, we will test
how such fluctuating activity patterns are coordinated with other neurons across sensory and
motor representations, and whether/how they contribute to performance of information-
preserving vs. information-selecting (attention) tasks. We will focus on one structure previously
implicated in information preservation - the inferior colliculus, which is an essential node of the
auditory processing stream through which nearly all ascending auditory information must pass,
and one structure previously implicated in information selection - the superior colliculus, a
multimodal brain area that has been shown to play a role in controlling eye movements and
spatial attention.
 We will specifically focus on (a) how fluctuations depend on the overlap in the population of
neurons potentially driven by each stimulus; (b) how fluctuations are coordinated across
neurons; and (c) whether and how these properties are affected by neural and behavioral
contexts taxing either the ability to preserve multiple stimuli or select individual stimuli to guide a
behavioral response. Recordings will be conducted with multiple electrodes, allowing the
assessment of coordinated fluctuation patterns via novel statistical approaches.
 These experiments will yield important insights into how neural representations operate
when challenged with multiple stimuli. The ability to keep multiple items in mind is central to
communication, working memory, attention, and sensory-motor skills, and it may be adversely
affected in disorders such as attention-deficit disorder, autism, central auditory processing
disorder, and age-related hearing loss."

Environmental exposures are major contributors to illness and premature death in countries around the world.
Air pollution is especially concerning as it promotes chronic cardiometabolic disease and can trigger acute
cardiac events. In rapidly urbanizing India, an estimated 1.67 million deaths per year are attributed to air
pollution, making it a factor in nearly 18% of total deaths and 11.5% of total disability adjusted life years. While
the link between air pollution and ill health is becoming clearer, we need to learn more how the components of
air pollution interact with each other and with other elements of the exposome such as heat, to affect health This
is especially important in LMIC cities, where industry and traffic generate pollution and climate change is causing
unprecedented heat waves. We also need to identify sensitive ages where air pollution exposure can be
particularly detrimental. Children pass through critical windows of development when they are highly sensitive
to exposures. Older adults are more likely to experience cardiac events when air pollution and heat levels rise.
In addition, exposures differ for people of different ages, gender, occupations, and socioeconomic status. To
address this complex situation, India needs experts trained in environmental health to carry out research and
recommend effective policies to mitigate air pollution exposure and protect those most vulnerable to its effects.
In this proposed project, entitled, “2/2-GEOHealth Health Effects of Selected Environmental Exposomes
Across the Life CourSe (HEALS)-US,” our multidisciplinary team of researchers, mentors and faculty from the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH) and the Centre for Chronic Disease Control (CCDC) will
build on knowledge gained in our original GEOHealth project in which trainees and mentors developed models
to estimate levels of ambient PM2.5 in Indian cities and quantified the links between air pollution exposure and
cardiometabolic disease and death in Delhi. In addition, three students earned master’s degrees from HSPH
and one earned a Doctor of Public Health (DrPH). The proposed project will focus on training early career faculty
and researchers and recent post-docs in designing a research study, writing up a proposal, and carrying out
research on topics related to the research aims of characterizing the exposome and identifying groups most
vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. Two additional DrPH students will also be trained. The project will be led
by Dr.Sieber and Dr.Schwartz from HSPH and by Dr. Prabhakaran of CCDC and Dr. Reddy of the Public Health
Foundation of India who will be assisted by the: 1) Administrative Oversight Committee; 2) Training Oversight
Committee; 3) Program coordination personnel at HSPH and CCDC; and 4) Supervisory teams to provide
oversight for individual trainees. Evidence from the research conducted under the linked U01 will directly inform
Indian government agencies and policy makers on how to reduce air pollution exposures and how to protect the
most vulnerable groups to reduce the consequent burden of disease. The proposed training of Indian scientists
will build capacity to apply for future funding and to fully understand and address this environmental threat."
10797017,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prior research has demonstrated a consistently strong inverse association between statin drug use and risk of
developing lethal prostate cancer, and a stronger protective effect with a longer duration of use. Further, in
men with clinically localized prostate cancer, statins are associated with a reduced risk of progression to
metastasis and dying from prostate cancer. For statins to have clinical utility as chemopreventive and
therapeutic (adjuvant) agents, additional characterization of the mechanisms through which statins interact with
the tumor microenvironment is needed. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional regulator highly
expressed in regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). Statin drugs have been shown to inhibit YAP nuclear
translocation (via YAP phosphorylation) required for Foxp3-meditated Treg immunosuppressive function. Thus,
we propose to investigate the association between statin drugs and YAP-mediated Treg dysfunction, a novel
immune-modulatory mechanism through which statins may impede development and progression of lethal
prostate cancer in the following specific aims. For Aim 1 (K99 phase) we will create a new tissue microarray
set including statin users and nonusers at the time of prostatectomy matched on clinical pathological
characteristics. We will evaluate whether the proportion of Tregs with phosphorylated YAP in the cytoplasm of
Tregs differs between statin users and nonusers, and if the prostate immune cell profile differs among statin
users and nonusers. For Aim 2 (R00 phase), we will conduct a proof-of-principle randomized trial investigating
the effect of statins on YAP-mediated Treg dysfunction in men diagnosed with prostate cancer scheduled to
receive prostatectomy. This proof-of-principle trial will also provide a controlled environment to assess the
effect of a single type of statin and dosing schedule to overcome heterogeneity in the type of statin drugs and
dose in the observational study purposed in Aim 1. Potential biases, such as confounding by indication, will be
minimized through the use of randomization. We will leverage the tremendous expertise in the biology and
measurement of the immune cell profile present in prostate cancer tissue and our established, well
characterized prostate cancer cohorts with associated archived tissue at JHU. The translational value of this
work lies in the ability to characterize the effect of statin drugs on a novel immunemodulatory mechanism,
which may be relevant in the setting of immune-based therapy for prostate cancer. This research plan is
complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in cancer epidemiology and
research synthesis methods and includes new training in 1) contributing an epidemiologic perspective in
multidisciplinary team science collaborations; 2) conducting tissue-biomarker validation studies; and 3) clinical
trial design and implementation. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a
successful independent research career focused the translation of cancer biomarkers into improved population
health outcomes."

 Fluorescence imaging is having a transformative impact on general medical science with the advent of
powerful preclinical techniques such as super-resolution microscopy and single-molecule-tracking, along with
emerging clinical procedures such as fluorescence guided surgery and rapid pathology. Each method requires
a specific type of fluorescent molecular probe, and in many cases non-optimal probe performance is a major
factor that is limiting long term progress and broad impact. Thus, the central objective of this research is to
develop greatly improved fluorescent dyes and convert them into molecular probes for important applications in
preclinical and clinical imaging. The largest set of projects are based on new fluorescent cyanine heptamethine
(Cy7) dyes that emit near-infrared (NIR) light with wavelengths >700 nm and enable imaging of living subjects
in the wavelength windows known as NIR I and NIR II (the latter window is also called Short Wavelength
Infrared). The new Cy7 dyes have innovative molecular design features that greatly enhance image contrast and
permit rapid fine-tuning of probe pharmacokinetic profiles. The near-infrared dyes will be converted into various
targeted and bioresponsive molecular probes for: (a) preclinical microscopy, including single-molecule
localization microscopy, (b) in vivo fluorescence imaging of animal models of disease, and clinical imaging of
patients undergoing surgery, (c) long-term implantable devices that use NIR fluorescence to report health status,
and (d) biomedical diagnostics and sequencing methods. Some of these Cy7 dyes will be so stable that they
can be incorporated, for the first time, into automated peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis protocols. This will
have a major impact on clinical translation since it will allow researchers to reliably make their own Cy7 labeled
peptide or oligonucleotide probes on a large scale using a standard synthesizer machine. A second set of
projects will develop a new class of fluorescent molecules whose unusual self-threaded structures are
reminiscent of entangled peptides. The probes have rigid peptide loops that promote outstanding stability and
targeting properties, along with bright deep-red fluorescence that is perfectly suited for advanced intracellular
microscopy. An early focus is on molecular probes that spontaneously permeate into living cells and permit
selective fluorescence labeling of any intracellular protein containing a polyhistidine sequence (His-tagged
protein). The work will create the first deep-red fluorescent molecular probes for rigorous nanoscale imaging of
subcellular polar lipids during biomedically important dynamic processes such as viral infection and
endosome/exosome trafficking. The utility and versatility of these new fluorescent probes will be demonstrated
by collaborations with experts in advanced microscopy. Close coordination with a commercial vendor will ensure
that the important fluorescent probes developed by this research quickly become available to all interested
investigators."

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an emergent, highly transmissible, geographically expanding, prion
disease of both wild and captive cervids. CWD is unique among prion diseases in its facile contagion and
environmental persistence. Its expanding geographical range, combined with the increasing transport of
animals and animal products, portend its continued expansion and diversification. The zoonotic potential of
CWD remains poorly understood. CWD endemic areas interface cervids with livestock species and humans,
posing obvious zoonotic risks that over time will increase. While it is known that strains of CWD exist, nothing
is known about the zoonotic potential of these strains. Work from our applicant group has shown that CWD-
infected cervids continually shed prions into the environment and that previously unrecognized environmental
factors can influence the emergence of a dominant strain from a mixture. The ability to recognize the zoonotic
potential of CWD strains is central to mitigating CWD transmission risk. The central hypothesis for work
described here is that CWD strains evolve continuously due to a combination of both host and environmental
factors. We will test this hypothesis by: i) determining the evolution and zoonotic impact of CWD strains in the
native cervid species; ii) leveraging our unique animal resources, expertise, and in vivo & in vitro
methodologies to assess environmental factors that alter CWD strain selection and evolution and iii) evaluate
zoonotic potential of CWD strains by a complementary combination of in vitro amplification assays and
animal transmission studies. The results will provide new information about this emergent transmissible prion
disease and the risk it poses to humans and other species."
10806810,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States and is associated with long-term
dysfunctions in growth. This is, in part, a result of immature gastrointestinal function and reduced digestive and
metabolic responses to feeding, making it difficult to assimilate enteral nutrition for growth. However,
mechanisms underpinning the blunted response to enteral nutrition and growth dysfunction in preterm neonates
are poorly understood. Fibroblast Growth Factor-19 (FGF19) is a potent fetal growth factor, but postnatally,
FGF19 is secreted by the distal ileum in response to bile acid stimulation and negatively regulates hepatic bile
acid synthesis. Preterm infants have a bile acid pool that is one-third the size of term infants and this smaller bile
acid pool may limit fat digestion and FGF19 secretion. Our recent studies in neonatal pigs showed that the
plasma FGF19 is markedly lower in preterm vs. term, and the lower FGF19 is driven by lower ileal
responsiveness to bile acid stimulation and a smaller hepatic bile acid pool. Pigs born vaginally had plasma
FGF19 levels 35 times greater than term pigs born via cesarean section and 70 times higher than preterm pigs
at birth. Among these groups of pigs, plasma cortisol directly correlated with plasma FGF19 concentrations. This
latter finding may be important since preterm infants are often given glucocorticoids perinatally to improve
respiratory function. In the proposed studies, I hypothesize that glucocorticoids upregulate the developmental
responses to bile acid homeostasis and FGF19 signaling in the perinatal period. In Aim 1A we will characterize
the developmental differences in molecular and cellular signaling pathways in preterm and term hepatocytes and
intestinal enteriods and examine their association with cortisol, bile acid homeostasis and FGF19 signaling. In
Aim 1B we will determine the effect of birth modality (vaginal versus cesarean section) and glucocorticoid
treatment (maternal and neonatal) on gut-liver bile acid homeostasis and FXR-FGF19 signaling in neonatal pigs.
In Aim 2, we will directly assess the effect of an enteral FXR agonist and hydrocortisone on the rate of growth,
tissue protein synthesis and intestinal development in preterm neonatal pigs. The results of these aims will
establish the role of perinatal glucocorticoids on bile acid homeostasis and FGF19 signaling and whether FGF19
functions to improve neonatal growth. My long-term career goal is to establish an independent, academic
research program to interrogate the effects of preterm birth on perinatal hepatic and gastrointestinal development
and physiology. I have assembled an expert mentorship committee to guide my development as an independent
investigator. My mentor, Dr. Doug Burrin has a record of accomplishment using neonatal pigs to model human
infant nutrition and development. Completion of these aims will allow me to pursue additional training and
develop skills in molecular techniques, cell culture, advanced imaging, and bioinformatics."

 REV7/FANCV is a versatile DNA repair protein. It binds to REV3 in the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA
pathway, and it binds to SHLD3 in the NHEJ repair pathway. REV7 has at least one additional seatbelt-binding
partner, CHAMP1. CHAMP1 is a little-known but highly conserved zinc finger protein, first identified as a REV7
interactor. CHAMP1 localizes to chromosomes, recruits REV7 to spindles, and plays a role in kinetochore-
microtubule interactions. Germline heterozygous mutations in CHAMP1 are associated with a rare syndromic
form of intellectual disability and dysmorphic features in humans, with some cellular and clinical similarities to
Fanconi Anemia, though the relevance of this disease to FA has previously been unexplored. We have very
recently shown that the binding of CHAMP1 to REV7 promotes DSB end resection and HR repair (Li et al,
2022). The CHAMP1 protein binds to the seatbelt domain of REV7, thereby increasing Homologous
Recombination repair and competing with the binding of SHLD3 or REV3 to REV7. CHAMP1 is a component
of a large, multisubunit heterochromatin complex, containing CHAMP1, POGZ, and HP1α (the so-called
CHAMP1 complex). We have shown that patient-derived mutations in the CHAMP1 protein disrupt the
CHAMP1 complex and disrupt HR repair, leading to a characteristic phenotype and drug sensitivity of the
peripheral blood lymphocytes of CHAMP1 patients. Interestingly, we have now shown that the CHAMP1
complex accumulates at telomeres (i.e., critical concentrated sites heterochromatin) and maintains telomere
length via its HR activity. Although most human tumor cells rely on telomerase to maintain telomere length,
many other human tumors use the ALT (Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres) Pathway, an HR-driven
pathway, to maintain telomeres and to avoid replication senescence. Importantly, we have now shown that
ALT tumor cells depend on the HR activity of the CHAMP1 complex, providing a molecular basis of the
CHAMP1 syndrome. Knockdown of the CHAMP1 complex in ALT tumor cells results in accelerated telomere
shortening. Accordingly, the ALT pathway and the CHAMP1 complex are now highly attractive targets for
cancer therapy. The Specific Aims of the current application are to analyze the structure of the CHAMP1
complex and to determine its role in HR repair and Telomere Length Maintenance.

10932364,"Abstract Alcohol and dysfunctional skeletal muscle mass: implications in aging
Alcohol use decreases skeletal muscle strength and function resulting in alcohol-related myopathy; one of the
earliest alcohol-associated pathologies. Alcohol use is disproportionately on the rise among older individuals,
with 25% engaging in heavy drinking and 11% reporting binge drinking. The increasing average life expectancy
in the United States leads us to predict that alcohol use will be an important factor exacerbating dysfunctional
SKM mass in chronological aging. Functional skeletal muscle mass is a critical contributor to overall physical
performance. Poor physical performance is closely linked to frailty syndrome that increases the risk of adverse
health outcomes, is a significant predictor of needing specialized care, and increases the risk for all-cause
mortality. Hence there is a critical need to understand the underlying mechanisms that can be targeted to reduce
risk, delay onset, or better manage frailty. One of the salient skeletal muscle-mediated mechanisms contributing
to physical performance and frailty is mitochondrial function. However, there is a gap in our understanding of the
interactions of alcohol use on physical performance and frailty in chronological aging, and on the role of
mitochondrial dyshomeostasis as a contributing factor. We propose a cross sectional study among people over
the age of 60 with or without alcohol use, with no overt underlying comorbidities, to test the overall hypothesis
that alcohol use decreases physical performance and increases frailty risk. We will investigate the mechanisms
involved in alcohol-associated dysregulation of SKM mitochondrial homeostasis to identify modifiable targets
amenable for lifestyle or pharmacological interventions. The results generated using these hypothesis-driven
studies will provide data that will inform translational targeted interventions to improve muscle mitochondrial
function. This application addresses one of the target areas of NIAAA's Strategic Plan to develop effective
strategies to prevent consequences of alcohol use in older individuals and is highly responsive to the NOSI:
“Alcohol and aging” and leverages the interdisciplinary translational team science approach within an outstanding
scientific infrastructure provided by the Comprehensive Alcohol Research Center at LSUHSC-NO."

There is an unmet need for understanding the complex relationships between the compliance of
interbody fusion cages, interbody loading, load-sharing, and the progression of spinal fusion in vivo.
Interbody fusion cages are spinal implants that have become highly popular over the last decade. An ideal
interbody fusion cage should be sufficiently stiff and strong to limit interbody motion and relieve the pressure that
may be causing pain, while “compliant” enough to allow sufficient load to be transferred through the spine to
maintain bone. We propose to investigate the effect of the mechanical compliance of interbody cages on
the spinal fusion rate and the subsidence of spinal segments in ovine models. To this aim, we will create
the first-of-their-kind compliant metamaterial fusion cages with tunable stiffness, porosity and energy
absorption, and will implant them in ambulatory vertebrate animals. We hypothesize that the proposed
metamaterial interbody cages with local compliance and reduced stiffness foster more consistent load-sharing
during the full range of motion from flexion to extension. This is clinically significant because load-sharing through
the interbody space stimulates bone formation and maturation and may ultimately lead to better outcomes.
Therefore, we hypothesize that the compliant metamaterial cages introduce a softer stabilization approach
leading to a faster bone formation and better fusion. Our first objective will be to perform topology optimization
to develop a series of “mechanically-optimized” metamaterial cages, which can be adapted to function in animal
models. We will create a computational framework that can serve as a universal method for the accelerated
design of the compliant fusion cages across a full relative density range with various biocompatible material
options. The fabricated cages will be mechanically tested following the protocols described by the ASTM
standards F2077 and F2267 to establish their static/dynamic fatigue properties, height loss and subsidence. Our
second objective will be to investigate the effect of metamaterial cage compliance on the rate of fusion using
sheep cervical spine models following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). We aim to deploy eight
adult sheep. The animals will be separated into “baseline control” and “compliant fusion” groups. The optimal
cage configuration with rationally designed unit cells and auxeticity will be used to design two cage types:
baseline stiff (100% stiff) and compliant types (20% stiff). Four animals will be instrumented with each of the
baseline 100% and 20% stiff cages. Digital imaging, microCT analysis and histological assessment will be
performed for evidence of fusion and cage subsidence. We expect that animals in the compliant group have
more extensive bone formation and superior rates of fusion compared with the animals in the baseline control
100% stiff group. The proposed experimental concept paves the way for the design of next-generation
compliant metamaterial fixation-devices for other treatments and therapeutics of fracture repair."

 Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen rated as a “serious threat” by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. It is particularly dangerous to immunocompromised patients, including patients
with hematologic malignancies (HM) and those recovering from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).
Recent epidemiological study discovered that fluoroquinolone (FQ) neutropenic prophylaxis in HM/HCT patients
was associated with breakthrough bloodstream infections with P. aeruginosa. These bloodstream infections were
dominated by isolates from the ST111 multilocus sequence type, a group of high-risk P. aeruginosa clones
known to frequently cause outbreaks of multidrug or extremely drug resistant infections in healthcare settings,
including HCT units. Our prior studies demonstrated that the vast majority of ST111 isolates from HM/HCT pa-
tients at Oregon Health Sciences University undergoing FQ prophylaxis were non-susceptible to both FQ and
meropenem, despite only a small fraction (5%) of patients receiving meropenem in the previous 6 months. Car-
bapenems are a crucial, front-line therapy in this patient population, and non-susceptibility is associated with
substantial increases in morbidity and mortality. Despite this, a knowledge gap remains in the mecha-
nistic understanding of the factors that contribute to ST111 dominance.
 Our preliminary data indicated that at least two different factors may drive this dominance. First, we have
evidence that ST111 secretes an inhibitory protein complex that prevents the growth of some other strains of P.
aeruginosa. This allows ST111 strains to dominate other strains, despite growing worse in isolation. Our prelim-
inary studies have identified this factor and pinpointed a defense mechanism used by resistant P. aeruginosa
strains to overcome growth inhibition.
 Second, whole genome sequencing has demonstrated that all of the dominant ST111 isolates have disrup-
tions to the quorum sensing regulator lasR. These quorum sensing mutants are predicted to be able to utilize
the normal signaling pathways, but do not expend the resources to contribute to them (a phenomenon often
observed in quorum sensing mutants). Importantly, some of the ST111 isolates had a fitness advantage com-
pared to PA14ΔlasR, while others did not, suggesting that these factors may be additive.
 In this grant, we propose to study each of these mechanisms and estimate their impact in a wider panel of
ST111 and sensitive isolates. Genetic and cell biological tools we have generated will be used to study each of
these factors, including previously unrecognized players in the production of the inhibitory factor. We will also
study LasR and its downstream components to determine what role they play in ST111 dominance. Completion
of the proposed experiments will help confirm factors that drive the dominance of ST111 and may help identify
methods to limit this dominance so that the spread of ST111 can be reduced, significantly improving clinical
outcomes for HM/HCT patients."

Childhood obesity prevalence keeps rising, especially among school-age children, and varies by race/ethnicity.
Children of origins in Asia and the Pacific Islands (Asian/PI), as a whole, have lower obesity prevalence; but, at
lower BMI levels, they have higher risk of obesity-related diseases relative to White peers. Asian/PI children
have remained largely invisible in obesity prevention efforts, though obesity prevalence varies widely among
Asian/PI subgroups, the fastest growing demographic group. Data scarcity is a significant barrier to the design
of strategies to prevent obesity and reduce disparities among Asian/PI. Nutrition policies—those that regulate
the nutritional content of foods and beverages in schools, including the so-called “competitive” foods sold
separately from school meals—could play a key role in the primary prevention of obesity and related chronic
diseases among Asian/PI subgroups. The community food environment near schools can also influence
obesity (e.g., through children’s access, purchases and consumption of unhealthy foods). No studies have
examined the combined influences of multiple nutrition policies and community food environments on child
obesity and disparities among Asian/PI children. Using unprecedented, longitudinal BMI data on >1 million
Asian/PI children disaggregated by ethnicities (Indian, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Guamanian,
Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Native Hawaiian, Samoan and Vietnamese), this quasi-experimental study
responds to the NIH Obesity Strategic Plan by evaluating policy and environmental effects on obesity
disparities. The first of its kind, this longitudinal study will: (1) determine the effects of federal and state
nutrition policies designed to improve food and beverages in schools on obesity disparities among a wide
range of Asian/PI ethnic groups; and (2) investigate how community food environments modify the effect
nutrition policies on obesity disparities. To obtain robust inferences, the study uses the best available
methods to evaluate non-randomized exposures: interrupted time series design and difference-in-
difference analysis to improve causal inferences. The study’s powerful design links longitudinal BMI measures
of diverse Asian/PI children with time-varying measures of the community food environments of all the
public schools to which children attended. Expected results: This study will: (i) strengthen the evidence base
by elucidating the causal effects large scale nutrition interventions on obesity disparities among Asian/PI ethnic
subgroups; (ii) identify nutrition environments near schools where nutrition policies are most effective; and (iii)
illuminate environments (inside and/or near schools) where additional interventions are needed. The study
results have potential to inform strategies focused on two major public health goals—prevent child obesity and
reduce disparities among severely understudied, yet fastest growing Asian/PI populations."

Stroke is a major cause of disability and mortality, particularly in low-income individuals and
people living with HIV (PLWH). It is associated with a variety of substances, including
amphetamines, opiates, cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and especially cocaine. However, most
stroke studies do not account for drug use outside of alcohol or tobacco, and substance use is
not included in stroke risk calculators. Our preliminary data suggest that cocaine use may
influence mechanisms of stroke. If true, the consideration of cocaine use in stroke risk
calculators could greatly improve risk assessment in PLWH who use drugs. We propose a new
study to assess whether cocaine and polydrug use, in combination with inflammation, are
significantly associated with stroke and mechanisms of stroke. The study will be one of very few
to recruit participants from both safety net HIV clinics and community-based settings. It will
provide much needed information regarding factors that influence conditions preceding stroke in
PLWH who use drugs."

The progressive decline in the function of adult stem cells is a major factor in the development of age-related
conditions. Considering the increasing age of the overall human population, identifying strategies to prolong
stem cell health is of major importance. Study of short-lived model systems has identified many potential
limiting factors in the maintenance of stem cells, but has been unable to elucidate whether and how stem cell
aging could be avoided altogether. We will leverage the negligibly senescent system S. mediterranea to reveal
the regulation underlying this animal’s ability to maintain stem cell health seemingly indefinitely. We previously
found that planarian stem cells employ a double layer of protection against transposons, whereas the shorter-
lived differentiated cells retain only a single defense layer, suggesting that transposons could be a significant
threat to stem cell maintenance. Further, loss of transposon silencing leads to rapid lethality in these otherwise
long-lived animals. This project focuses on the role of transposon silencing and chromatin compaction in the
resistance to aging phenotypes of planarian tissues. We intend to leverage our recent finding of stereotypic
age-related markers in planarian differentiated cells to determine the role of various pathways in the
progression of planarian aging. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to elucidate whether changes in transposon levels
or in chromatin regulation can change the rate of aging in planarian differentiated tissues. Aim 2 addresses the
role of various transposon-related pathways in the indefinite maintenance of planarian stem cells. Aim 3 will
determine whether there is a correlation between the lifespan of a planarian tissue type and its control of
transposons. Furthermore, the genomic locations of age-related changes in chromatin modifications will be
addressed.
This project will provide new insights in the workings of a negligibly senescent system. Understanding of the
mechanisms it employs in the long-term maintenance of its actively dividing stem cell population will provide
new avenues to pursue in search for strategies to extend human stem cell health."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and
therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms
underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the
prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated
biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic
platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of
proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant
protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the
Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International
Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is
postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central
purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC
team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related
(HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise
required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most
comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a
Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through
collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational
analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be
experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific
Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate
subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of
HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new
prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods
developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases."

This Atopic Dermatitis Research Network-Clinical Research Center (ADRN-CRC) proposal aims to establish a
clinical and laboratory infrastructure to support the ADRN-Leadership Center (ADRN-LC). The current
proposal will evaluate the endotypes underlying three AD phenotypes: AD patients with propensity to eczema
herpeticum (ADEH+), AD without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-) and AD with food allergy (AD+FA+).
We propose that these different phenotypes and endotypes of AD are associated with different skin barrier
profiles that can be defined by genomics, lipidomics, transcriptome, and proteomics. The project will establish
a clinical and administrative infrastructure of trained clinical staff with capabilities of recruiting adult and
pediatric AD populations, clinical research facilities, investigational pharmacy services, IRB personnel, and
laboratory facility capable of conducting single-center ADRN-CRC and multi-center clinical research for the
ADRN Consortium in the areas of mechanisms and treatment of AD. Here, we propose two CRC-specific
research projects as outlined in this application. Project 1 will focus on mechanisms of disseminated viral
infections in eczema herpeticum. The project will utilize archived and newly established keratinocyte and
fibroblast cell lines from skin biopsies of ADEH+ and ADEH- subjects and non-atopic controls. We intend to
evaluate the role of nine novel ADEH+ genetic risk mutations identified by the study group in anti-HSV-1
responses and keratinocyte differentiation. In addition, the contribution of sphingolipid metabolism and S1P in
HSV replication will be examined. Lastly, epidermal differentiation program of ADEH+ keratinocytes influenced
by prior in vivo exposures to the cytokine environment and viral exposure will be evaluated. Project 2 will
assess skin barrier abnormalities and oxidative stress response in the skin of AD patients with FA. The project
will characterize skin barrier function of AD+FA+ children and adults through clinical and skin tape strip
lipidomic and proteomic assessment. Evidence for oxidative stress responses in AD+FA+ skin samples and its
link to skin barrier abnormalities in these subjects will be examined through the analysis of expression of
oxidative stress response enzymes, oxidative protein modifications in skin tape strip samples, and responses
to oxidants of the organotypic skin cultures from AD+FA+ subjects. The projects will provide new knowledge
about AD endotypes, biomarkers for disease assessment, and novel molecular targets for clinical disease
interventions."
10817679,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Coordinated specialty care (CSC) provided in the early course of psychosis can reduce the long-term
chronicity and dysfunction associated with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. However, few young adults with
early psychosis (EP) are engaged with these programs. Young adults with EP are particularly susceptible to
stigma and negative beliefs about psychiatric treatment, and thus are often apprehensive to present to in-
person care. Despite their reluctance to seek services, young adults with EP often engage with mental health
resources through online and mobile technologies. Several digital health interventions have been developed as
adjuncts to in-person services for this population and have demonstrated feasibility, acceptability and
preliminary efficacy. However, there are few available digital health tools designed for young adults with EP
who are not connected to in-person care. In the absence of such tools, individuals often turn to social media or
forums that often reify stigmatizing beliefs or discourage help seeking. Mobile health interventions appear
particularly well suited to this population given the fact that mobile devices are the primary media source for
most young adults and can provide individualized, real-time, real-place support to introduce users to
psychosocial interventions involved in CSC. It remains unclear at present, however, whether and how remotely
delivered mHealth can be leveraged to increase engagement in treatment for young adults with EP.
 The proposed research project proposes to develop and test an mHealth intervention designed to
impact help-seeking beliefs through psychoeducation, stigma-reducing content, stress management exercises,
and locally relevant treatment information delivered through audio, video, and automated motivational text
interactions, and personalized through ecological momentary assessment (EMA). This project will take a user-
centered design approach with individuals who are both engaged and unengaged in treatment, including (1) a
contextual inquiry to understand barriers, interests and preferences related to mHealth and in-person
treatment, (2) development, refinement and usability testing, and (3) a pilot randomized controlled trial
assessing feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy compared to an active control mHealth intervention
providing only stress management.
 This research project will provide a central piece of the candidate's overall training plan. This K23
career development award provides training to support an independent research program developing
interventions that reduce barriers to care for young adults with EP. This includes three training areas, including
(1) mobile health targeting increasing mental health care engagement, (2) user-centered design, and (3)
advanced longitudinal models and quantitative methods for digital health trials. These goals will be met through
expert mentorship, didactic training, coursework, and the successful completion of the research project."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is costly and burdensome. As the US population ages, AD’s public health impact
continues to grow. NIH and Alzheimer’s Association consensus statements indicate that understanding early
phases of disease progression—such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI)—beginning in middle age is key to
slowing dementia onset. Identifying at-risk individuals early is also estimated to result in massive savings.
Despite the protracted progression of AD brain pathology, little is known about its temporal course from middle
to older age, particularly for neuroimaging indices. The Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA) focuses on
early identification of risk for MCI/AD and AD-related brain changes beginning when subjects were in their 50s.
The proposed VETSA MRI wave 4 project, with a mean age of 74 (67-78), occurs during a time of increased
incident MCI/AD. That, in combination with our longitudinal data, allows for improved ability to determine
neuroimaging correlates, trajectories, and their predictors. Continued data collection will allow us to examine
the transition period from pre- to post-disease onset and expand on prediction from midlife for an increasing
number of individuals. This project is linked to the funded general VETSA 4 grant (AG050595) which collects
10-12 hours per subject of cognitive, health/medical, psychosocial and biomarker data. In addition, we can
elucidate genetic and environmental influences on these processes via combined twin and genome-wide
genotyping/polygenic score data. We also capitalize on early (age 20) cognitive data, a unique feature
enabling us to differentiate cognitive decline from longstanding differences. We request funds to cover MRI
acquisition, processing, and analysis (n=500), leveraging associated ongoing work in the general VETSA 4
grant. Aims are: 1) Develop, validate, and characterize novel early brain indicators of risk for MCI/AD. We will
develop and validate a novel AD brain signature based on diffusion MRI and show that this brain signature of
adults who are only in their 50s improves prediction of progression to MCI. We also hypothesize that integrity
of the locus coeruleus—the earliest brain site of tau deposition—will be another early, sensitive risk indicator.
2) Examine cerebrovascular risk factors and their relationship with cognition and AD biomarkers.
Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) is the most common pathology concomitant with AD and may contribute to
disease progression or be an independent source of brain and cognitive decline. We particularly focus on CVD
markers of white matter hyperintensities and arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion. 3) Quantify the magnitude
of neurodegeneration from midlife to early old age and its underlying genetic and environmental influences.
We will examine genetic influences on longitudinal change in macro- and micro-structural brain measures. Our
approach includes identifying mediating/moderating effects of risk factors across the lifespan and leveraging
our twin and genome-wide genotype data. Covering ~18 years, this project will be a resource for advancing
knowledge about early identification of risk for MCI/AD, with potential for a profound public health impact."

The hippocampus plays a critical role in the formation of episodic memories by generating
distinct, conjunctive representations of (spatial and social) experiences and transferring these
representations to prefrontal cortical sites for memory storage or consolidation. Age-related
cognitive decline and mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) are characterized by increased memory
interference, decreased stability of memory representations and inefficient memory
consolidation. Evidence from humans, non-human primates and rodents demonstrate reduced
hippocampal neurogenesis, hippocampal hyperactivity and inflexible remapping during age-
related cognitive decline and MCI. Parvalbumin inhibitory interneurons (PV INs) play a pivotal
role in memory discrimination and consolidation by regulating neuronal excitability and
synchronizing neuronal firing underlying neuronal ensembles and sharp-wave ripples (SWRs).
Thus, reduced PV IN recruitment in hippocampal CA2, a hub for social memory processing, may
contribute to age-associated social memory impairments. Here, we propose a role for
neurogenesis-inhibition coupling in the dentate gyrus-CA2 as a candidate circuit mechanism by
which adult-born neurons promote social memory consolidation in adulthood and aging. In
response to the FOA, we will develop and validate an in vivo gain-of-function platform for iterative
testing of pro-cognitive potential of novel candidate regulators of neurogenesis-inhibition
coupling during aging. Towards this goal, we will build on extensive preliminary and published
data and integrate a genetic approach to enhance neurogenesis, input-specific manipulation of
PV INs, activity-dependent molecular profiling of PV INs, PV IN targeted viral expression,
optogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo local field potential recordings and an aging-sensitive social
memory behavioral paradigm. Together, these Aims will establish proof-of-concept for a novel
platform for targeting a neurogenesis-inhibition coupling mechanism to improve social memory
in aging and MCI."

10817815,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly disrupted the daily lives of adolescents and their families in
the United States. Emergency school and community closures confined children and adults together in their
homes with greatly limited access to other supportive adults and institutions. Adolescents' involvement in
developmentally-normative contexts was interrupted. This crisis evolved into a chronic, relapsing and remitting
state of life with intensities that varied dramatically between families and communities as well as across weeks,
months, and now years. As such, there is a critical need to understand how these disruptions affected
adolescents' and parents' short- and long-term health, and in particular, their alcohol and other substance use.
The present study addresses this need through the combination of extant data analysis and prospective data
collection. Rooted in life course developmental theory, we will explore the implications and developmental
timing of pandemic-induced disruptions and stressors for adolescents' and parents' alcohol and other
substance use in the ongoing accelerated longitudinal Parent and Adolescent Sibling Study (PASS). PASS
includes 1364 adolescent siblings and their parents; adolescents ranged in age from 10 to 17 (grades 5-10)
during the pre-pandemic period at Wave 1 (2019). Families in PASS provided/will provide survey data three
times over two consecutive years during the pandemic (Wave 1.5, May-June 2020; Wave 2, Fall 2020; Wave
3, Fall 2021). With the proposed Wave 4 (Fall 2022), PASS's multi-wave (5 total assessments across four
years), multi-family member longitudinal study will capture the entire arc of the COVID-19 pandemic. Testing
the life course principle of linked lives, we will investigate the associations between multiple family members'
alcohol and substance use patterns throughout the pandemic period. This focus on the family context is critical
given its fundamental importance for youth's alcohol and other substance use was further amplified during
shutdowns/restrictions as it has been the primary site in which pandemic stressors were experienced. Finally,
we will identify risk and protective factors (both between-person and within-family) that moderate the influence
of pandemic-related disruptions on youth's alcohol and other substance use patterns and trajectories. The
aims will be tested using a structural equation (SEM) framework. This flexible analytic procedure is
advantageous as it can model longitudinal data which are nested within individuals as well as data from
siblings which are further nested within families. SEM permits modeling of individual differences in change
patterns (including non-linear patterns), attributes those differences to both time-varying and time-invariant
covariates, and efficiently accounts for missing data. Ultimately, understanding how adolescents and parents
suffered, adapted, and coped with pandemic challenges is key for supporting recovery from this era, for
understanding response to economic crises and natural disasters, and anticipating long-term trends in alcohol
and other substance use among the current cohort of adolescents."

 We propose to establish a U-RISE training site at Delaware State University (DSU) as a catalyst to
attract, and to closely train, up to 18 undergraduate students per year in any of the biomedical research
disciplines, totaling up to 54 trainees over the five-year period of the grant. Our STAR Scholars will be
mentored and motivated to ultimately pursue their PhD degree and careers related to biomedical research.
DSU, an Historically Black University (HBCU), enrolls about 4800 undergraduate students, with over 70%
being members of racial and ethnic minority groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM. Based
on best practices from the literature, we will implement an educational and research training program that
will support successful graduation of our scholars and ensure that they are accepted to biomedically-related
graduate programs, are motivated to attend, and are prepared for success. Our STAR Scholars will
participate in two summer research internships, first on the DSU campus, and the second at a research
intensive institution. Through the IDeA Networks of Biomdical Research and other connnections, we have
identified a large number of partner institutions who will host our STAR Scholars in their summer
undergraduate research programs, ensuring that they are matched with trained, experienced mentors. To
support our Scholars, we have designed a series of activities, courses, and workshops that will provide
knowledge and skills development to support academic success at DSU and in graduate school. Our
Scholars will be supported by strong, culturally-competent mentors, who have completed an on-line
mentoring course and participate in interventions shown to minimize implicit bias.
 To increase STEM engagement and self-efficacy and strengthen critical thinking skills among the
broader STEM student community at DSU, our program supports professional development to faculty to
integrate course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) into introductory STEM courses. We
expect these early research experiences to increase retention and motivate more students toward careers in
research. We aim that 90% of our DSU-STAR trainees graduate with a bachelor’s degree in a STEM
discipline, at least 60% of our trainees pursue a biomedical Ph.D or Ph.D/M.D. degree at a research-
intensive institution, and at least 80% of those matriculants obtain their degrees. Furthermore, the DSU
STAR program will also support initiatives to increase the four and five year graduation rate from 25% to
35% and 38% to 50%. Finally, we will establish assessment mechanisms to evaluate the program, to ensure
its continuous success."

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accumulate in the blood, lymph nodes, and
bone marrow and at tumor sites in most patients and animals with cancer suppress
antitumor immunity and are therefore a significant impediment to cancer immunotherapy.
Given the nature of cellular heterogeneity and plasticity of MDSCs, the mechanisms and
in situ conditions that regulate and sustain MDSC differentiation and survival, and the
mechanisms MDSC use to promote tumor progression remain largely unknown. Our
preliminary data demonstrate the importance of type 1 cysteinyl leukotriene
receptor (CysLTR1) for the accumulation and immunoregulatory activity of MDSCs in the
cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs)-rich tumor microenvironment. These results have led to
the novel hypothesis that CysLTR1 signaling is essential in tumor-induced MDSC
accumulation for both immune suppression and tumor promotion. In this proposal, we
will characterize further the phenotype and function of MDSCs in the tumor
microenvironment, and explore the signaling pathways implicated by CysLTR1 in
regulating MDSC differentiation, turnover and function using both gain-of-function and
loss-of-function approaches. Our research will provide new insights into how MDSCs are
induced and suppress antitumor immunity, and how they are molded by the tumor
microenvironment, and may offer a clinically applicable strategy on MDSC targeting to
enhance the efficacy of current tumor immunotherapies."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by motor abnormalities primarily caused by loss of midbrain
dopamine (DA) cells, which significantly modulate striatal neurons. DA depletion is thus associated with altered
function of striatal projection neurons (SPNs). SPN dysregulation is evidenced by significant morphological and
physiological changes, as shown in numerous ex-vivo and in-vivo studies. Furthermore, our studies in primate
models and patients have revealed pathological hyperactivity of SPNs. A key contributor to this hyperactivity is
the excitatory glutamate signaling. This has been recently demonstrated with selective striatal blockade of
NMDARs. The block reduces hyperactivity and controls the altered neuronal responses to DA replacement.
Furthermore, it has significant effects on parkinsonian motor symptoms. Therefore, data support that reducing
NMDAR signaling on SPNs may have therapeutic effects in PD. Given the largely conserved structure of
NMDARs across brain regions, pharmacotherapies are generally limited by widespread drug actions. We
recently tested gene therapies targeting NMDAR subunit expression in the striatum. Our preliminary data
generated with exploratory tests in rodents showed that, indeed, gene knockdown (KD) of GluN2 subunits may
offer a novel therapeutic strategy to improve motor symptoms of PD. Thus, data support advanced preclinical
studies of GluN2 gene KD in non-human primates (NHP) for extensive evaluation of this gene therapy in the
gold-standard model of PD.
In this project we plan to demonstrate “efficacy” of GluN2 gene KD for various motor and cognitive symptoms
of PD. The studies will use primate MPTP models and shRNA viral vector injections in the striatum to suppress
gene expression of GluN2 in SPNs. A battery of motor and cognitive tests will be used over a prolonged term
post-virus administration to determine stable, chronic effects. Taking advantage of PD modeling in NHPs,
different disease stages will also be evaluated. We also include additional outcome measures to evaluate
“safety” of targeting the proper assembly of NMDAR in the striatum. Finally, we will validate this gene therapy

for cell resolution in NHP recordings. Overall, the research strategy in this proposal is based on optimal animal
models, viral vectors of proven efficiency, extensive testing of motor, cognitive, and other behaviors, and
precision tools for electrophysiology. We expect that results of these studies demonstrate efficacy and safety

The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provided scientists with the opportunity to develop
differentiated tissues from patients with inherited disease, and to use these in vitro models to study disease
mechanisms and to test drug and gene-based therapeutics. However, current differentiation protocols often fail
to accurately recapitulate the cellular organization present in the native tissue. For example, even state-of-the-
art retinal differentiation protocols, which give rise to three dimensional retinal organoids, do not accurately
recapitulate the cell-cell interactions that are present in the outer retina. Specifically, choroidal endothelial
cells are rarely present and never form an organized layer beneath the RPE. Similarly, rather than forming a
monolayer juxtaposed to newly developed photoreceptors, RPE cells are often found in clusters located at the
edges of the neural retina. In this application we describe a program focused on the development and
validation of a microphysiological system engineered to accurately recreate the complex architecture of the
perfused outer retina. Specifically, we propose to combine ultra-high resolution, state-of-the-art 3D printing of
retinal scaffolds, iPSC technology, and microfluidics to develop a next generation microphysiological system
that recapitulates the outer retina unit. Completion of the aims outlined in this proposal will help pave the way
for future studies focused on evaluating the pathophysiology of complex retinal degenerative disorders such as
age-related macular degeneration and development of novel drug and gene-based therapeutics."

To maximize cancer patients’ survival rate post-therapy, in vitro immortal cancer cell models and newly
developed patient-derived organoids are widely used to study the role of tumor metabolism reprogramming in
tumor growth and survival under therapeutics stresses. Although conducting longitudinal metabolic
measurements on the same tumor sample during a course of therapy is critical for therapeutic studies, there
are surprisingly few techniques that can provide a systems-level view of tumor metabolism on in vitro cancer
models or organoids non-destructively. Several metabolic tools, such as Seahorse Assay and Metabolomics,
provide standardized metabolic measurements but often require destructive sample preparation. Relying on
the non-invasive nature of optical technique, this proposal seeks to fill the critical technical gap by developing
an optical spectroscopic assay that will enable non-destructive high-throughput metabolism measurement on in
vitro cancer models and organoids for cancer research. Specifically, we will develop a novel multi-channel
fluorescence spectroscopic assay and a machine learning de-convolution algorithm to quantify the key
metabolic parameters of in vitro cancer models (Aim 1). As there is a significant unmet clinical need for breast
cancer (BC) radiotherapy (RT) sensitivity evaluation prior to treatment, we will demonstrate our non-destructive
assay for early prediction of BC radiation responses within the decision-making window via longitudinal
metabolic characterization of patient-derived organoids under radiation stresses (Aim 2). Our technology fills
an important gap that exists between Seahorse Assay (in vitro cells) and Metabolomics (in vitro cells and ex
vivo tissue) by providing a novel approach for non-destructive metabolism measurement on in vitro cancer
models and patient-derived organoids. Our innovative RT sensitivity prediction model will directly impact BC
patients by providing a novel paradigm for patients’ RT sensitivity prediction during the decision-making
window. Once we demonstrate the proof-of-concept of our optical technique and the RT sensitivity prediction
model, we will move our study to a large-scale trail in clinics with a goal of providing individualized RT for BC
patients in our future R01 plan."
10819726,"Project Summary
 On February 3rd, 2023, a train carrying several chemicals derailed near East Palestine, Ohio, leading
to a fast-moving contamination event that spread released chemicals and their combustion by-products
through the surrounding region. The impacted communities include the immediate evacuation areas in a one-
mile by two-mile area surrounding East Palestine, the other communities in Columbiana and Beaver Counties,
and potentially some downstream communities along the Ohio River. Thus, there is an urgent need to mobilize
environmental monitoring for capturing the extent of contamination in soil, water, and sediment which serve as
the accumulative sinks of the contaminants, as well as document the likely severe and ongoing impacts on the
local environment of these regions and its highly interconnected waterways. Overall, this project aims to
determine the post-accident exposome profiles in the impacted communities surrounding East Palestine due to
the released or generated contaminants caused by this human-made disaster. The overall objective of this
proposal is to determine the post-accident chemical exposome profiles in the impacted communities by both
targeted and non-targeted approaches, thus further conducting fate and transportation, environmental
exposures, and human health risk assessment modeling. Specifically, the following two aims will be performed
to determine the exposome profiles and evaluate the health risks of the chemicals in these exposome profiles.
Aim 1 involves collecting 75 evenly distributed soil, water, and sediment samples in the impacted communities
and conducting rigorous targeted and non-targeted analyses on persistent combustion byproducts including
dioxins, furans, chlorinated furans, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Aim 2 involves performing a model-based comprehensive
evaluation of the long-term environmental fate, human exposure levels, and corresponding health risks of all
the quantified contaminants in the exposome profile. A comprehensive model named ”PROduction-To-
Exposure“ will be used to evaluate the accidental release magnitudes of chemicals or generated byproducts
during this derailment accident. This will be a time-sensitive project since the sampling of environmental
matrices needs to begin as soon as possible by performing both immediate analysis and sample banking to
create a record of evolving regional contamination. This project will provide critically needed data on a broad
suite of contaminants that can currently impact the human health surrounding East Palestine as well as
Columbiana and Beaver Counties. Disseminating the results as soon as possible can benefit the communities,
municipalities, and regulators to ensure that key stakeholders are empowered to make informed decisions
about exposure interventions and remediation."
10823296,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exposure to a parent with chronic pain in childhood is one key risk factor for pain and adverse mental and
physical health outcomes among children. In particular, having a parent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),
an idiopathic chronic abdominal pain disorder, places children at 2x greater risk for developing an abdominal
pain disorder. Our own research has demonstrated that pain-specific social learning is highly influential in this
intergenerational transmission. However, there is essentially no previous research that has attempted to
intervene with parents to prevent illness behaviors in early childhood, when these illness behaviors often
emerge and become established. Our team has developed and tested social learning and cognitive behavioral
therapy (SLCBT) interventions to change parental behaviors and modeling in order to reduce children’s illness
behaviors. We hypothesize that SLCBT can be modified toward a preventive focus for parents with IBS who
have young asymptomatic children, ages 4-6 years, in order to reduce risk factors (anxiety, catastrophizing,
parenting stress) and increase protective factors (positive affect, social support), resulting in fewer abdominal
pain symptoms in children, reduced health care utilization, and less health-related disability. Therefore, the
objective of the current application is to test the efficacy of an early preventive intervention targeting parents
with IBS whose young children are thus at higher risk for developing illness behavior and subsequently a
diagnosis of a chronic abdominal pain disorder. To enhance potential for scalability and dissemination, and
meet parental preferences, we propose delivering the intervention via the internet through approaches our
team has successfully used with other psychosocial pain interventions. The study design is a randomized
controlled trial with parallel 1:1 assignment to two study arms, 1) attention education control, and 2) SLCBT
prevention intervention. We aim to recruit 460 parents with IBS who have young children ages 4-6 years.
Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6-week (immediate post-intervention), 6-month, 12-month, and 18-
month follow-up periods. All study procedures will be conducted remotely using digital platforms and web-
based technologies. Social media ads will be used to advertise the study and recruit participants. The primary
outcome is change in parental solicitous/protective behaviors. Secondary outcomes include parent risk and
protective factors and child health and symptom outcomes. We will determine cost savings of implementing
this preventive intervention on health care expenditures and resource utilization over 18 months. The proposed
study will be the first to evaluate the potential benefit of an early preventive psychosocial intervention
specifically for children at risk for a common pediatric pain condition. If successful, this study has high potential
impact to provide a model for a preventive intervention for a wide range of pediatric health problems which can
impact functioning beyond childhood in which parental responses are influencing factors."
10823301,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mechanisms underlying the origin and maintenance of adult form, and naturally occurring variation in adult
form, remain poorly understood. This research program seeks to elucidate how gene activities are translated
through cellular behaviors into speciﬁc morphological outcomes at adult stages. Such information will con-
tribute to understanding patterning and morphogenetic mechanisms essential for postembryonic development,
with relevance to human genetic disease, birth defects, aging and regenerative medicine. For these efforts, the
work uses pigmentation of zebraﬁsh, its close relatives in the genus Danio, and more distantly related teleost
ﬁshes. Pigment cells in these animals and other vertebrates arise from embryonic neural crest cells that also
contribute to a wide variety of other tissues and organs, including most of the peripheral nervous system and
craniofacial skeleton. Defects in neural crest derived lineages generally, and pigment cells speciﬁcally, are as-
sociated with numerous hereditary pathologies as well as cancers, including melanoma. During normal devel-
opment, pigment cells that arise either directly from neural crest cells or indirectly through postembryonic stem
cell intermediates organize into highly stereotyped, largely two dimensional patterns in the transparent skin.
Cell behaviors during pattern formation are readily observed as phenotypes develop, and genetic mechanisms
are accessible through mutational analyses and other approaches, both in striped zebraﬁsh and in other
species having very different adult patterns. The work described here builds on prior effort in this program, and
takes an unusually integrative approach to understand pattern and pattern variation, combining manipulative
experiments, genetic analysis, high resolution imaging, cutting edge genomics, comparative biology and be-
havioral assays. Goals in the coming years are to elucidate: (i) mechanisms by which pigment cell progenitors
are speciﬁed for different pigment cell types during development, and how diversiﬁcation of cell types has been
achieved evolutionarily; (ii) genetic and cellular mechanisms underlying self-organizing interactions among
pigment cells that are essential for pattern formation, and how these interactions and permissive factors have
changed to generate alternative pattern states among species; (iii) the roles of positional information in the tis-
sue environment in setting the location of discrete pattern elements that are essential for establishing pattern,
and how such information contributes to qualitatively different types of pattern across species. These efforts
will provide novel insights into pattern development and cell type diversiﬁcation over both developmental and
evolutionary time. General principles uncovered will likely be applicable to a wide range of traits that depend to
varying degrees cell type diversiﬁcation, self-organizing cellular interactions, and positional information derived
from tissue environments.

10823303,"This project focuses on understanding a fundamental cellular mechanism underlying a range of important
physiological signaling in humans including the control of feeding and obesity. The mechanism uses an ancient
cellular signaling organelle, the primary cilium, to control responses to satiety signals generated following feeding.
Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a rare human syndrome called a ciliopathy because of mutations in genes encoding
components of the primary cilium. Patients with BBS have inherited mutations in genes linked to a complex called
the BBSome, discovered in our laboratory, that fail to present receptors critical to limit feeding after a meal. Our
work has found that cilia also control adipogenesis via the de novo generation of new fat cells and the secretion of
insulin and glucagon in pancreatic islet cells. We have focused on mechanisms of ciliary signaling and trafficking,
enabled by the use of affinity purification/mass spectrometry to identify new components of the ciliary machinery.
These studies have been initiated by using the ciliopathy disease genes as bait proteins to find new components
and cell biological pathways linked to ciliary traffic and signaling. A number of these newly discovered components
are themselves mutated in human pedigrees linked to obesity. In particular, a ciliary structure called the distal
appendage serves as a critical gate for entry of ciliary receptors. We find that mutations in components of the distal
appendage are linked to monogenic obesity syndromes. As monogenic obesity syndromes are rare, the lab has
shifted to systematically surveying public data for over 750,000 patients in Genome Wide Association Studies
(GWAS) for genes found to be altered in patients with high Body Mass Index (BMI) (a key measure of obesity) and
diabetes. We have discovered 100s if not 1000s of candidates for a substantially broader list of candidates for
obesity drivers linked to cilia in nonconsanguineous populations. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will further explore
the mechanisms by which the distal appendage is assembled and how that organizes trafficking into the cilium. In
Aim 2, we will examine how the distal appendage traffics receptors and generates signals in the cell. In Aim 3, we
will explore a new factor of the distal appendage, called CCDC92, which potentially controls signaling via proteolytic
destruction of ciliary signaling regulators. In each Aim, we will use genetic lesions derived from patients with high
BMI which we find have screened for defects in ciliary trafficking or signaling. Our goals are to continue to explain
obesity lesions to allow accurate assessment of a patient’s genetic obesity drivers, to identify additional druggable
targets for obesity and diabetes therapeutics, and to communicate these findings to the public to help predict dietary
susceptibilities based on molecular genetic profiles. By identifying signaling pathways defective in obesity and
diabetes, we can identify targets to protect or restore these tissues and molecular profiles of patients to facilitate
patient selection for treatments to improve obesity and metabolic disease."
10824108,"PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT 2
The goal of Project 2 is to understand how age-related declines in lung immunity and antiviral response
relate to corresponding changes in the epigenome and respiratory microbiome. Older adults have
increased susceptibility to viral infection and adverse outcomes. Multiple factors contribute to this increased
susceptibility, including changes in innate immune memory and consequent changes in interactions with
commensal microbiota, which play an important role in the morphogenesis and maintenance of respiratory
immunity. Numerous epigenetic changes have been associated with aging-related disease. Our overarching
hypothesis is that age-related epigenetic changes in the lung epithelium are linked with an altered response to
the commensal microbiome, leading to chronic inflammation and altered tissue immunity to respond to viral
infection. In Project 1, we observed significant transcriptional differences in lung progenitors from older vs.
younger individuals. We seek here to determine, using bulk and single-cell genome-wide chromatin accessibility
assays of air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures developed from these older vs. younger lung progenitors, to what
degree epigenetic modifications drive these transcriptional changes and which are associated with altered viral
response (Aim 1). Then, we will investigate to what degree these aging-associated modifications affect
interactions with microbial stimuli (Aim 2), stimulating old/young ALI cultures with genetically diverse microbes,
examining phenotype and transcriptional response following colonization. Finally, we will investigate how the
collective changes in epithelial immunity resulting from age and differential microbial response affect interactions
with tissue-resident immune cells and collective influenza response (Aim 3), leveraging the Technology
Development Project's models integrating alveolar macrophages into ALI cultures. We anticipate that these
data will pinpoint microbial and epigenetic mechanisms contributing to lung immune aging, and how in turn these
changes affect viral response."
10824109,"PROJECT SUMMARY TECH DEV PROJECT
The goal of the Technology Development (Tech Dev) Project is to develop approaches and tools that address
the needs of The Jackson Laboratory-Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Cooperative Center on Human
Immunology (JAX-ISMMS CCHI) and that also advance the capabilities of the broader scientific community to
tackle fundamental mechanistic questions regarding human lung immunity and human immune-epithelial cell
interactions. Major questions related to lung immune function remain unanswered—such as the cell-to-cell
interactions between immune and lung epithelial cells that shape responses to foreign agents, and how age-
dependent changes in splicing and epigenetic modifications impact tissue immunity and inflammation. A
significant technical barrier to studying human immune-lung dynamics is the sheer complexity of the human lung
and the dynamic interactions between the lung epithelium and resident immune cells such as macrophages,
dendritic cells, and T cells. This complexity cannot be easily modeled in animal systems or using deceased
human lung tissue. To surmount these challenges, the Tech Dev Project will focus on three aspects to further
increase complexity and utility of an innovative human tissue platform which we have pioneered in our current
Center: establish three-dimensional (3D) bioprinted ventilated and vascularized models of the lung and upper
respiratory environment for investigating the functional lung-immune interactome during exposure to viral agents
(Aim 1); develop improved methods for viral infection and co-culture of immune cells in lung models (Aim 2);
and develop methods for, and perform, editing of airway epithelial cells, virus, and commensal bacteria for
inclusion in lung models (Aim 3). Epithelial editing will entail development of tools to alter isoform usage (for
Project 1), epigenetic modifications (for Project 2), and generating conditional alleles in primary human airway
epithelial cells and induced-pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). For viral editing, we will engineer various reporter
influenza viruses to enable tracking of active versus history of infection. For bacterial editing, we will alter
production of candidate immune modulating metabolites from commensal bacteria (for Project 2) by perturbing
their associated metabolic pathways either by using our CRISPRi toolkit or via overexpression. Each of these
Aims addresses a specific unmet need for the Center and will enable us to study human lung immunity within a
dynamic and physiologically relevant microenvironment and to interrogate specific cell types and molecular
pathways predicted to respond to viral infections. Through these efforts, the JAX-ISMMS CCHI will be equipped
to address previously inaccessible questions related to lung-immune dynamics, towards a more mechanistic
understanding of lung immune function."

This proposal is the fourth renewal of our continuously funded Global Infectious Disease training grant that
established the International Malaria Training and Research Program (IMTRP) in 2002 (PD/PI, D. Perkins).
While a central theme of our research training platform has focused on severe childhood malaria, the IMTRP
has progressively expanded to include additional leading infectious diseases in Kenya. Our training approach
utilizes advanced scientific instruction in thematic core areas with general principles that can be applied to
combat a multitude of infectious diseases. This strategy offers advantages for creating long-term capacity
building to address the challenges presented by both ongoing and newly emerging high-burden infectious
diseases. Based on current and future needs identified by our Kenyan partners, we propose advanced research
training in: (1) Host-Pathogen Dynamics, (2) Therapeutic Discovery, and (3) Disease Modeling. Training will be
provided to address the ongoing challenges of malaria and the emergent crisis due to COVID-19. The next
phase of our activities will continue long-standing international partnerships between the University of New
Mexico (UNM), Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Masinde Muliro University of Science and Technology
(MMUST), Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI), and West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious
Pathogens (WACCBIP, Ghana), along with a new partner, Kirinyaga University (KyU). During the current funding
cycle, trainees were highly prolific in generating peer-reviewed manuscripts (32) and presenting at international
meetings (61). Moving forward, we propose long-term training (12 months) in Kenya for junior faculty at our
partner institutions, along with postdoctoral fellows, and doctoral students (4 per year in each category). The
IMTRP has created a highly successful pipeline of diverse trainees to continue in these career development
tracks towards independent investigator status. A competitively awarded re-entry grant will be provided each
year to support junior faculty in this important transition. We also propose medium-term training for specialized
mentoring in advanced methodologies (technical and data analytic) for 3-4 trainees per year (6 months) in the
US (UNM and/or LANL) and for 2 trainees per year (2-3 months) at WACCBIP. Short-term, in-depth training (2-
3 days) will also be offered annually on specialized research methodologies in the thematic three training areas
and requisite research competencies. The overall training paradigm will foster sustained establishment of
independent researchers in Kenya. Expansion of our highly successful training program in the next phase is
based on over $50M in annual funding for the multidisciplinary team assembled. The training platform will
provide transfer of technology and expertise to address the challenges of malaria, COVID-19, and other high-
burden infectious diseases in Kenya. Collectively, the overall approach will promote long-term capacity-building
and sustainability by establishing a critical mass of Kenyan scientists with the knowledge and skill sets necessary
to address the public health challenges facing their society."
10823310,"Project Summary/Abstract
Arterial thrombosis, which describes the formation of abnormal blood clots in the artery, is a highly fatal
disease that claims ~500,000 American lives per year. A symbolic feature of arterial thrombosis is the elevated
shear rate and shear force generated by stenosis, which facilitates platelet aggregation towards vessel
occlusion. Unfortunately, current therapeutic strategies are ineffective in inhibiting the prothrombotic effects of
the pathological blood flow, and have a major risk of excessive bleeding. The overall objective of this proposal
is to establish a mechanism-driven strategy to better treat arterial thrombosis. Our lab's previous works and my
research identified that the prothrombotic effects of pathological blood flow result from a phenomenon called
“biomechanical platelet aggregation”, in which mechanical force drives platelets to crosslink. Von Willebrand
factor (VWF) is a plasma protein that mediates platelet crosslinking by binding to platelet receptor GPIbα. In
my preliminary study, I worked on an artificially designed triple-residue VWF mutation named `M13', which
inhibited VWF in mediating biomechanical platelet aggregation and shear-induced thrombogenesis, but did not
affect platelet adhesion or hemostasis. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that: biomechanical platelet
aggregation is a key factor to arterial thrombosis, and its inhibition can suppress arterial thrombosis
without compromising hemostasis. I propose 4 aims to step-by-step establish anti-thrombotic approaches
targeting the biomechanical platelet aggregation. Aim 1 will combine biomechanics and hematology assays to
study the mechanism underlying M13's function in inhibiting biomechanical platelet aggregation but not
adhesion. Aim 2 will establish a microfluidic-based assay that concurrently assesses platelet adhesion and
shear-induced thrombogenesis, which allows the screening of anti-thrombotics targeting biomechanical platelet
aggregation. In Aim 3, a monoclonal antibody against VWF, NMC4, was identified to be functionally aligned
with my anti-thrombotic strategy. I will collaborate with my postdoctoral lab and use NMC4 as a prototype to
design and produce anti-thrombotic agents. A 3-step screening procedure will be established to select
candidate agents with the best functional performance. Lastly in Aim 4, I will expand my anti-thrombotic
strategy to another platelet receptor also important to biomechanical platelet aggregation: integrin αIIbβ3. I will
explore the efficacy and safety of inhibiting both VWF- and αIIbβ3-mediated biomechanical platelet aggregation
in treating arterial thrombosis exacerbated by diabetes. Overall, this research will be accomplished in the
setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to help me achieve my career goal as an
independent researcher in the interdisciplinary field of vascular biology, mechanobiology and bioengineering.
During the K99 phase, I will continue to gain expertise in biochemical, preclinical and translational approaches.
My mentor, collaborators and consultants will together guide me in the steps towards successful transition to
independence over the course of the award period."

Hematopoietic cell transplantation from unrelated donors, haploidentical related donors and cord blood units
can cure life-threatening blood disorders; however, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse and
survivorship disparities across different ancestries remain the major obstacles. When matched donors are not
available, the properties of HLA mismatches that govern (non)-permissivity are not well-defined. Furthermore,
the role of KIR/HLA interactions in modulating relapse remain to be clarified. These deficiencies have important
implications for a large fraction of patients who lack HLA-matched donors, and for all patients at risk for
disease relapse. We have demonstrated that HLA class I leader peptides, HLA-DP expression, and HLA/KIR
interactions each contribute to GVHD, relapse and mortality. The unmet needs are to understand the
mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes modulate transplant risks, and a means to apply the research
findings to clinical care. We propose to define the underlying mechanisms through which HLA and KIR genes
and proteins function in transplantation, and develop tools for using HLA and KIR in the selection of the optimal
transplant donor and cord blood unit. The specific aims are to: define the role of HLA-DP expression and
peptide-binding groove pocket in GVHD; define NKG2/HLA-E interactions and HLA-G in GVHD and relapse;
define the role for KIR and HLA interaction in relapse after HCT for acute leukemia, and design tools to
evaluate gene features in clinical practice. The goals will be achieved through systemic analysis of individual
gene variation, haplotypes of genes, and receptor/ligand recognition in large ethnically diverse transplant
populations with complete clinical data. This proposal will fill the knowledge gap in the immunobiological basis
of GVHD, relapse and survivorship disparities in transplantation. The information will increase the safety,
efficacy and availability of transplantation for all patients in need of this life-saving therapy."

Antibodies (Abs) are commonly employed in biomedical research to identify and quantify target
proteins. However, the specificity, sensitivity and reliability of these Abs can be variable, which is a
significant concern in the scientific community. The use of an incorrect Ab can result in misleading
or inaccurate results, impeding progress in various areas of biomedical research. In Phase I of this
project, we developed tools to validate the specificity of commercial Abs used to detect
phosphorylated sites in proteins in a method we developed and published that we named
MILKSHAKE. We will present some of these results from this Phase I effort, which demonstrates the
critical need to address this concern. This proposed SBIR Phase II project aims to both extend and
commercialize the Phase I effort. We will continue the Ab validation work initiated in Phase I by
extending the analysis to other types of post-translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins in
Western analysis and flow cytometry. This Phase II project also seeks to improve and scale this
pipeline further, and to develop new methods for validating Abs against glycosylated proteins, which
are often dynamic and challenging to detect using traditional techniques. We will also employ an
innovative tool for measuring Ab promiscuity using a technology we term ‘Sundae’ to better
investigate the specificity of the Ab paratope. Sundae will be demonstrated for two therapeutic Abs.
The Phase II project has several key objectives, including the development of new Ab-specific
assays and the establishment of a centralized database for sharing validated Ab data. The project
team comprises experts in Ab validation, proteomics, and molecular biology, and will collaborate
closely with our current and future industry partners and academic researchers to ensure our
success."
10819976,"This SBIR project will test and expand a novel multiplex BioAssay protocol to safeguard the nation’s water
supply against chemical contaminants at concentrations that illicit a biologic effect.
The US Safe Drinking Water Act establishes the methods and frequency of water monitoring for chemical
contaminants in US drinking water. 100,000 chemicals currently are considered as potential “contaminants of
emerging concern” (CECs). Practically, the scale and cost of monitoring 100,000 unique CECs by existing
methods necessitates evidence-based prioritization. Currently, the EPA mandates public water agencies to
regularly monitor the amounts of >60 specific inorganic and organic chemicals, disinfectants and byproducts
through the water procurement process from water sourcing, storage, treatment to tap. Another 66 chemicals
currently are listed in the EPA’s “Contaminant Candidate List-5 (CCL-5)” for less frequent, exploratory
evaluation. Methods that enable affordable monitoring of all 100,000 suspect chemicals are desired. High
throughput molecular BioAssays, which report on the activity of a protein, provide one solution in which the
presence of any activity-altering contaminant(s) can be detected in a water sample.
National and international water monitoring authorities have shown interest in BioAssays as broad monitors of
the water supply. The major impediment is that current commercial BioAssays cost around $150 to report on
just one BioAssay-specific signaling pathway and many of those costly BioAssays are needed to screen across
many different chemical classes. XCellAssay’s major INNOVATION has been to develop highly multiplexed
protocols to accurately measure many different ‘bar-coded’ BioAssays affordably and simultaneously on the
same water sample added to a single well of a 384-well dish. In practice, 15 or more different BioAssays could
be readily surveyed at a total commercial price of just $30 to meet water monitoring needs.
For this SBIR application, we will develop a cost-effective, comprehensive broad BioAssay survey of water
quality. Our initial molecular targets will be proteins of the Nuclear Receptor (NR) class because of the
pervasive concerns about the prevalence of Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) in our surroundings.
In Phase 1, we propose to troubleshoot the development of the tools for water monitoring by:
Aim 1: developing water measurement protocols with our existing panel of five bar-coded NR BioAssays
Aim 2: implementing into our instrument database the bar-code unmixing processes for rapidly and accurately
separating an expandable number of spectrally distinct ‘green’ and ‘red’ fluorescent protein tagged BioAssays
If Specificity, Sensitivity and Reproducibility milestones are met for the pilot Phase I study, Phase II would
develop a set of Nuclear and Xenobiotic Receptor BioAssays for comprehensive EDC monitoring of the water
supply. Once the EDC platform is fully developed and validated (Phase II), the plug-and-play nature of the
platform will allow expansion to BioAssay panels for non-EDC contaminants in the water supply."

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, deaths due to alcohol use spiked to 25% percent beyond its expected toll. It is
this ever-growing global burden of alcohol-related harm that has propelled our team to conduct over 15 years of
research to codevelop with people with AUD and then scientifically test a highly flexible, patient-driven, low-
barrier, in-person treatment known as harm-reduction treatment for alcohol use disorder (HaRT-A). HaRT-A
meets people where they are at to help them create goals around reducing alcohol-related harm and engage
safer-drinking strategies, even if they are not ready, willing or able to stop drinking. Findings from our recent,
NIH-funded randomized clinical trials have shown the efficacy of this low-barrier, in-person HaRT-A in reducing
heavy alcohol use and alcohol-related harm and in improving health-related quality of life, even in a population
that is socially marginalized and severely impacted by AUD. However, the vast majority of people with AUD --
approximately 93% in 2021 -- do not seek in-person treatment. Barriers to alcohol treatment attendance include
the high time and monetary cost of in-person treatment, its lack of patient-centeredness and flexibility, and the
stigma of others knowing one is in treatment. In addition, the pandemic made greater swaths of the general
public comfortable with digital technologies for health and treatment service provision. Thus, a mobile application
of HaRT-A could reduce barriers to help-seeking by creating easier access to evidence-based alcohol
interventions. In this STTR phase 1 application, we propose to develop and initially test a mobile application to
deliver the HaRT-A components (mHaRT-A) and thus address alcohol-related harm and AUD in a more
accessible and scalable as well as less costly and stigmatizing way. We plan to accomplish this goal by building
the mHaRT-A prototype with a human-centered design framework and then iteratively testing its usability,
feasibility and acceptability among people with AUD. Our Aim 1 milestone is a human-centered prototype of the
mHaRT-A progressive web application that will advance for usability testing in Aim 2. Our Aim 2 milestone is to
complete lab-based usability testing of the mHaRT-A and achieve a System Usability Scale score of 70 or
greater, which would indicate an adequate system. Our Aim 3 milestone is to test the feasibility and acceptability
of the high-fidelity mHaRT-a prototype and the planned STTR Phase 2 randomized clinical trial procedures as
demonstrated via adequate recruitment, retention and implementation of the planned procedures. Successful
completion of the STTR Phase 1 project will create the foundation for a well-powered STTR Phase 2 randomized
clinical trial testing mHaRT-A’s efficacy in reducing alcohol-related harm and improving health-related quality of
life. If successful, this overarching project will build an evidence base for the successful commercialization and
dissemination of mHaRT-A to people with AUD and to healthcare providers and systems."
10819839,"SUMMARY. The DNA Damage, Mutation and Cancer Gordon Research Conference (GRC) is a leading
international scientific conference focused on advancing science through the presentation of cutting-edge and
unpublished research, prioritizing time for detailed discussion after each talk, and fostering informal interactions
among scientists of all career stages. The conference is five days long and held in an accessible location
(Ventura, CA, which is a shuttle ride from Los Angeles International Airport). The location is adjacent to a beach,
which lends itself to leisure activities to foster informal interactions that are important to forge scientific
communities. Afternoon free time and communal meals also support such interactions, and two of the dinners
will have “Theme Tables,” which involves trainees having the opportunity to sign up for specific tables that have
been assigned to speakers and other notable attendees (e.g., senior scientists in industry and scientific editors).
The program includes a diverse set of invited speakers, with several additional slots for short talks to be selected
from submitted abstracts by a selection committee. In addition to speaking presentation sessions, the conference
has substantial designated time for poster sessions from individuals of all career stages. The conference will be
all-inclusive and emphasize trainee participation beyond the associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) pre-
meeting for trainees that will precede the GRC. There will be a “Power Hour” session for attendees from all
career stages for a guided discussion of support and growth of women in science, support for all
underrepresented population scientists, and aspects of work/life balance. Finally, as another mentoring
component, we will request that all session chairs prioritize questions from trainees and junior faculty during the
discussion sessions. The scientific focus of the program is research on defining basic mechanisms of the DNA
damage response (DDR) and leveraging this information for translational research on cancer biomarkers and
therapeutics. The DDR is central to cancer biology. In addition to the importance of mutagenesis in the etiology
of cancer, many treatment modalities involve the DDR, e.g., clastogenic chemotherapeutics, radiotherapy, and
synthetic lethality via PARP inhibitors and other emerging targets like DNA polymerase theta. Accordingly, the
program covers the range from structural biology of key players in the DDR, mechanisms of mutagenesis and
chromosomal rearrangements in cancer, DDR and DNA replication mechanisms as relates to mechanisms of
therapeutics, and mutations and deregulation of the DDR and cancer. In addition, since the importance of the
DDR in cancer is related to its interplay with the immune system, there is a session on this topic. Finally, there
is a session on the DDR in the brain, which is important for understand both neurodegeneration as well as
malignancies and metastasis to the brain. The sessions will include new approaches and technologies, and
provide attendees a grasp of the current landscape of research on the mechanisms of the DDR through
application of this knowledge to improve cancer treatment outcomes."
10818895,"Project Background: In health care, social and cultural factors such as Veteran identity and culture (VIC) and
racial identity and culture (RIC) influence patient and provider behaviors, beliefs, concepts of health and
wellness, as well as approaches to power sharing and decision making. This can create partnerships or
conflicts and influence the provision of patient-centered care (PCC). Key elements of Veteran culture are
hierarchical power structures and resilience. However, research has noted that these values can lead to
maladaptive behavior in civilian settings. For example a Veteran’s focus on being self-reliant may inhibit their
willingness to seek treatment. Qualitative interviews with VA providers have echoed these cultural barriers to
PCC, with many noting that they felt patients were reluctant or unable to engage in PCC and providers
acknowledging that they generally did not understand why disengagement occurred. Similarly RIC plays a role
in PCC. In a sample of 231 patients, Black patients reported greater medical mistrust than White patients,
which was associated with lower willingness to accept provider recommendations. When providers used
patient centered communication techniques the relationship between medical mistrust and provider mistrust
was weakened, though not eliminated, for all racial groups. Conversely, a study utilizing standardized patients
(SP) found that when Black SPs demonstrated behaviors such as asking questions or voicing concerns or
opinions it disrupted racially biased interpersonal treatment associated with provider implicit bias.
Impact on Veteran Health Care: VA is transforming to Whole Health (WH), health care that is “personalized,
proactive, and patient-driven; and engages and inspires Veterans to their highest possible level of health and
well-being.” Research on WH in VA provided implementation insights and initial outcomes but there is currently
no research on potential racial disparities or the impact of Veteran culture. The proposed project is part of the
next generation of WH research, which will explore nuances of implementing WH with diverse Veterans and
identify strategies to engage hesitant Veterans in WH. Failure to consider how Veterans’ VIC and RIC and
related lived experiences with providers orients them toward health care is not patient-centered and may
undermine the efficacy of WH PCC education and activation.
Diversity Project Objectives: Omnis Salutis is a WH PCC Veteran education and activation intervention
currently being tested in a randomized control trial in an RR&D Merit. In the proposed research 15 Black-
identifying Veterans and 15 White-identifying Veterans who were randomized to Omnis Salutis will participate
in one-time qualitative interviews. Aim one will explore perceived barriers and facilitators to Veterans’
participation in WH related to their VIC and RIC. Aim two will understand similarities and distinctions in barriers
and facilitators among Black-identifying and White-identifying Veterans. Finally aim three will identify VIC- and
RIC-informed guidance about what promotes or prevents participation in Whole Health.
Diversity Project Methods: VA investigators will partner with investigators from Howard University (HU), a
Minority Serving Institution (MSI). The team will use narrative inquiry approach, a method to investigate how
people make meaning of their lives and experiences in socio-cultural contexts, to create a semi-structured
interview guide, conduct interviews, and analyze data. After each interview the interviewer will complete an
analytic memo. Then a study team pair will use dynamic thematic content analysis procedures to process and
analyze each interview. This approach will allow researchers to engage in inductive and deductive reasoning
that will capture the semantic and latent meaning of the participants' perceptions and experiences in the
interviews. This strategy of inquiry aims to understand the nuances and complexities of lived experiences in a
storied form and what these experiences mean to the individual. Additionally, the study team has a detailed
plan to promote partnerships with scientists associated with HU to enhance diversity in VA research."
10818479,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms with myelofibrosis (MPN-MF) exhibit constitutive activity of JAK-STAT signaling
due to mutations in JAK2, c-MPL or calreticulin genes. Additional mutations in chromatin/transcriptional
modifiers (epimutations) induce transformation to AML (sAML) in up to 20% of patients with MPN-MF. Lack of
significant activity of the JAK1 & 2 inhibitor (JAKi) ruxolitinib and of AML chemotherapy highlights the need to
develop and test novel agents and combinations that would improve clinical outcome in patients with post-
MPN sAML. Genetic alterations and dysregulated epigenome produce the dysregulated transcriptome
responsible for the transformed phenotype and therapy-refractoriness in post-MPN sAML blast progenitor
cells (BPCs). This dysregulated transcriptome is dependent on ‘chromatin-reader’ BET (bromodomain and
extra-terminal) proteins (BETPs), e.g., BRD4, and on its interactor pTEFb (positive transcription elongation
factor b), both recruited to super-enhancers and promoters of actively-transcribed oncogenes. Cyclin
dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), the catalytic subunit of pTEFb, phosphorylates RNA pol II (RNAP2), promoting
RNAP2-mediated mRNA transcript elongation of oncogenes essential for growth and survival of post-MPN
sAML BPCs. However, effects of BETP-CDK9 axis inhibition on active super-enhancers/enhancers and
promoters with resulting impact on the dysregulated transcriptome and survival have not been elucidated in
patient-derived (PD) sAML BPCs. Additionally, epigenetic mechanisms of resistance to CDK9 or BETP
inhibitor (CDK9i or BETi) treatment and their therapeutic abrogation in post-MPN sAML BPCs need
evaluation. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that CDK9i or BETP-antagonist (BETi and BETP-
PROTACs) treatment induces apoptosis of post-MPN sAML BPCs, which is associated with repression of
sAML-relevant oncogenes, e.g., c-MYC, STAT3/5, NFkB, Bcl-xL and MCL-1. We hypothesize that BETP-
antagonist and CDK9i-based combinations will repress the dysregulated transcriptome and oncogenes, and
with JAKi or BCL2/Bcl-xL inhibitor co-treatment, synergistically induce in vitro and in vivo lethality in PD, post-
MPN sAML BPCs. Specific aims of these studies are: Aim 1: To elucidate the effects of BETP-PROTAC
and CDK9i on active super-enhancers/enhancers (by ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq), mRNA transcriptome (by
RNA-Seq) and on protein expressions (by CyTOF), as well as determine their pre-clinical efficacy against
genetically-profiled, cultured cell lines and PD, post-MPN sAML BPCs. Aim 2: To determine lethal activity of
BETP-PROTAC and CDK9i-based combinations against JAKi-sensitive and JAKi-persister/resistant sAML
BPCs, utilizing in vitro cell cultures and in vivo xenograft models. Aim 3: To elucidate the dysregulated
epigenome and transcriptome as well as susceptibility to BETP-PROTAC-based combinations in BETi- or
CDK9i-persister/resistant post-MPN sAML BPCs."
10818481,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is the most common cause of developmental disorders, though concurrent
exposure to other psychoactive substances may exacerbate adverse outcomes. Recent preference for
simultaneous use of alcohol and cannabis (SAC) among young adults of child-bearing age combined with early
preclinical evidence for synergistic developmental harm, support a premise for investigating SAC as a specific
developmental source of disability. Despite indications that both PAE and prenatal cannabinoid exposure (PCE)
alter endocannabinoid signaling through cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) in offspring, it is yet unknown whether
impairments to CNR1 – a receptor essential to healthy fetal neurodevelopment – underly impairments associated
with SAC. Notably, PAE impairs CNR1-regulated synaptic transmission from striatal-projecting cortical neurons.
In drug-naïve mice, impaired striatal CNR1-regulated activity contributes to motor dysfunction, hyperactivity and
increased drug-seeking behaviors, deficits observed in humans with PAE and PCE. Therefore, the objective of
this proposal is to investigate the impact of SAC on CNR1-associated neural circuits and behaviors in exposed
offspring. Preliminary data from our lab have shown that a CNR1-associated gene network that regulates striatal
synaptic activity is changed by acute fetal ethanol exposure, and combined SAC exposure augments growth
deficits in neural stem cells from single-drug and drug-free exposures. Collectively, the literature and these data
inform our central hypothesis that SAC offspring will exhibit impaired CNR1-linked synaptic mechanisms within
the striatum corresponding with increased motor deficits and drug-seeking behaviors.
We will test this hypothesis in the following aims: Specific Aim 1) To assess SAC-induced changes in genes
that regulate corticostriatal synaptic activity. We will use integrative RNAseq and ATAC-seq to investigate a pre-
determined gene network associated with CNR1-regulated corticostriatal synaptic plasticity in prenatally
exposed offspring. Specific Aim 2) To assess whether SAC augments behavioral deficits and striatal protein
expression. We will perform a battery of behavioral assays investigating native deficits in motor function and
ethanol-seeking behaviors in prenatally exposed offspring. We will compare behavioral deficits with striatal
protein expression using sandwich ELISAs, quantifying CNR1 and endogenous cannabinoid ligands
anandamide and 2-arachidonylglycerol. Prenatal drug exposure will occur from gestational days 12-15, a period
of peak neurogenesis for corticostriatal neurons, and will incorporate vaporized ethanol inhalation and i.p
administration of synthetic cannabinoid CP-55940. Successful completion of this proposal will identify specific
mechanistic changes underlying SAC, a translationally-relevant but under-investigated form of prenatal drug
exposure, and inform future targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the proposed experiments will
provide the framework for an excellent training environment, including mentorship from multiple sponsors and
collaborators, and will subsequently inform a scientifically rigorous K99/R00 grant application."
10818565,"The Integrated Clinical Neuroscience (ICN) Training Program, operating within the Clinical Psychology and
interdisciplinary Neuroscience programs at Florida State University for the past 9 years, seeks to train the next
generation of investigators to become leaders in translational research and make major advances in several
areas of psychopathology characterized by dysregulated behaviors including eating disorders, depression,
anxiety disorders, suicidality, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. These problems are
associated with significant psychological and medical morbidity, elevated mortality, and high economic burden.
This underscores the need for research that translates the neural mechanisms underlying normal and
abnormal behavior in animals into clinical studies of the causes and treatment of mental disorders. However,
segregation of doctoral training in Clinical Psychology and Neuroscience, with separate courses, lab
experiences, and exposure to outside speakers, impedes new scientists’ preparation to undertake translational
approaches in their own research. The ICN Training Program was designed to break down these barriers.
Here, we seek continued funding to provide integrated instruction, research experience, and mentorship to 4
predoctoral ICN trainees earning PhDs in Clinical Psychology and Neuroscience through 1) cross-area
courses, 2) cross-area lab rotations, 3) a Special Speaker Series in which trainees present their research to
invited scholars conducting translational science, and these scholars present their work to trainees, our
participating Departments, and the community, 4) presentation of research at conferences and in published
papers, and 5) instruction in grant writing, data science, and cross-area instruction in the responsible conduct
of research. Predoctoral trainees apply for the ICN Training Program by describing research they plan to
conduct in collaboration with their primary advisor and cross-area mentor, classes they will complete, and how
this cross-area exposure will contribute to their career development as translational scientists. Students are
typically appointed for two years beginning in their 3rd to 4th year to ensure selection of the most promising
trainees who have completed basic program requirements and established research interests that can be
extended by a cross-area lab rotation. Our training model has supported a total of 19 trainees. Among the 13
ICN trainees who have completed the Ph.D., 92% have continued in research careers (with 4 currently in
tenure-track positions) and 77% have received highly competitive fellowships and independent research
grants. Training faculty, selected for their cross-area connections in research addressing dysregulated
behaviors, continue to excel in securing grant funding and training students for research careers with strong
publication records. Continuation of the ICN Training Grant for an additional 5 years will build upon our
accomplishments and ensure that a third cohort of Ph.D. students is ideally positioned to initiate cutting-edge
translational research to address mental disorders characterized by dysregulated behaviors."
10818566,"Project Summary
Barrett’s esophagus and small cell carcinoma in the esophagus are characterized by the loss of squamous cell
identity while gaining other cell fates. Thus far effective treatment options for these diseases are limited in part
due to an incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the initial cell fate changes. This
application will address how the transcription factor p63 directs the squamous differentiation program and safeguards
esophageal basal progenitor cells from neuroendocrine cell commitment.
We and others have demonstrated that loss of p63 leads to the abrogation of the stratified squamous epithelium
in the developing esophagus. However, how p63 regulates cell fate determination of esophageal progenitor cells
remains largely unknown. Surprisingly, we found that p63 deletion results in extensive neuroendocrine
differentiation in the esophagus. Moreover, loss of p63 expression was also observed in small cell carcinoma of
the esophagus. Inhibition of the key epigenetic silencing factor EZH2 re-activates p63 expression in
neuroendocrine cells, which is accompanied by the acquisition of squamous cell fate. We therefore hypothesize
that epigenetically regulated p63 expression suppresses neuroendocrine while promoting the squamous cell
differentiation program in the esophagus. Three specific aims are formulated to test the hypothesis. Aim 1 will
test whether the role played by p63 in cell fate determination is isoform-specific and conserved in human
esophageal progenitor cells (EPCs). We will combine mouse genetic models and human pluripotent stem cell
differentiation to address this Aim. Aim 2 will determine p63-mediated transcriptional program during the
specification of EPCs. We will use multiple epigenomic assays including ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to determine
p63 downstream targets at the genome-wide level. We will also use biochemistry assays to test candidate genes
implicated in cell fate transition that are potentially bound and functionally regulated by p63. Aim 3 will determine
the mechanism and impact of p63 silencing on neuroendocrine commitment. In this Aim we will investigate how
p63 expression is modulated by epigenetic regulatory mechanisms during aberrant cell fate commitment, thus
identifying strategies to restore the squamous differentiation program. Combining our joint expertise on mouse
genetics, cell biology, chromatin biology and epigenomics, this work will provide novel mechanistic insights into
esophageal cell fate regulation and offer new approaches to treat neuroendocrine lesions."

10818372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High expression of the transcriptional co-activator Meningioma-1 (MN1) is common in AML, and associated
with a poor prognosis. Forced expression of MN1 in murine hematopoietic progenitors induces an aggressive
leukemia. We recently discovered that the primary interaction partner of MN1 is the BAF nucleosome-
positioning complex. MN1 stabilizes BAF on chromatin. MN1 binding is associated with sustained active
enhancer chromatin at enhancers regulating a hematopoietic stem/progenitor program. We hypothesize that
MN1 stabilizes promoter-enhancer contacts at these sites through a BAF dependent mechanism. The goal
of this project is to uncover the molecular mechanism of MN1-mediated leukemic transformation. A better
understanding of how MN1 causes leukemia may identify opportunities for targeted therapies in a patient
population who is failing conventional AML therapy."
10818423,"Summary
To orchestrate complex processes like motility and endocytosis, cells rely on regulatory proteins that control the
dynamics and architectures of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin filament nucleators are important actin regulators
because they allow cells to control the initiation of new actin networks and dictate the architectures of these
networks. Arp2/3 complex is a seven subunit actin filament nucleating machine that specifically generates
branched actin filaments. Regulated branching by Arp2/3 complex is important not only for processes
required for normal cellular function, such as endocytosis and protrusion of lamellipodia, but also in pathogenic
processes like host cell infection by bacteria or metastasis of tumor cells. The majority of studies on Arp2/3
complex regulation have focused on WASP proteins, an activator that mediates propagation of branched actin
networks. These studies revealed the basic tenets of WASP mediated activation; that WASP binds to Arp2/3
complex, recruits actin monomers, and stimulates an activating conformational change. However, the
molecular aspects of WASP mediated-activation most important for understanding the biological function of the
complex are still unknown. For instance, it is unknown why WASP proteins require actin filaments to activate
Arp2/3 complex, a requirement that allows Arp2/3 complex to function specifically as a branched actin filament
nucleator. Further, it is not known why WASP (but not other activators) must recruit actin monomers to Arp2/3
complex to trigger nucleation, despite the fact that this requirement regulates the density of branched filament
ends in Arp2/3-assembled actin networks. In addition to WASP, several other regulatory proteins are now
known to activate Arp2/3 complex. We recently discovered that the WISH/DIP/SPIN90 (WDS) proteins are
distinct from WASP in that they can activate Arp2/3 complex without preformed filaments to induce it to
nucleate linear actin filaments. These linear filaments serve as seeds to kickstart WASP-mediated branching
thereby initiating actin network assembly. Despite the fact that initiation is perhaps the most important
step in controlling branched network assembly, how WDS proteins activate the complex to create seed
filaments is unknown. Furthermore, it is not understood how the activity of WDS proteins is coordinated with
other activators like WASP, or how WDS proteins themselves are regulated. Here we propose a combination of
biochemical, biophysical, structural, computational, and cell biological approaches to investigate these
questions, with a long-term goal of understanding how these regulatory mechanisms allow Arp2/3 complex to
control actin dynamics in complex cellular processes."

The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center requests continued support for the Integrative
Immunology Training Program, which prepares graduate students, medical scientist trainees, and post-doctoral
fellows for cutting-edge careers in immunology and related fields. The IITP is a 40-year old training program
that supports two-year training periods for six predoctoral students in their second year or later of graduate
school, and one postdoctoral fellow in the first or second year of their fellowship. The IITP leverages the
outstanding educational and research environment at UT Southwestern Medical Center to provide an
understanding of the basic, public health, and clinical problems related to immunology, and to foster the
intellectual, technical, and communication skills required to succeed in the biomedical workforce. The IITP
transcends departmental boundaries to provide a program that reflects the interdisciplinary nature of modern
immunology, which draws from and radiates into many different fields. This application describes a
comprehensive recruitment, training, and retention program for pre- and post-doctoral trainees that combines a
strong basic science curriculum including translational content, an actively-involved, highly distinguished
faculty, and integrated training across diverse areas of immunology. The ability of this training grant to bridge
an existing foundation of outstanding faculty in basic and clinical immunology distinguishes it from a
standardized general graduate and postgraduate educational program. The IITP at UT Southwestern is
designed to meet several objectives. First, trainees will be knowledgeable about the most important principles
and problems in immunology. Second, trainees will be knowledgeable about both basic and
clinical/translational aspects of immunology. Third, trainees will be skilled in communicating scientific
challenges and discoveries to a wide range of individuals, ranging from experts to laypersons. Finally, trainees
will possess both the scientific knowledge and collaborative proficiency to work together in interdisciplinary
teams to address complicated and pressing questions in immunology. The IITP enhances the existing
graduate training programs at UT Southwestern by providing new opportunities for interdisciplinary and
collaborative training in immunology. Value-added features of the UT Southwestern IITP include (a)
personalized instruction in scientific writing, specifically aimed at funding opportunities; (b) training in scientific
communication; (c) engagement with clinical trainees and faculty, aimed at promoting knowledge of clinical and
translational immunology; (d) support for trainee teaching activities; and (e) collegial support and career
enrichment opportunities through engagement with the IITP Steering Committee. Altogether, the IITP supports
interdisciplinary immunology training that is essential for a biomedical workforce that can resolve pressing
global health issues such as emerging infectious diseases and an aging population suffering from metabolic
and autoimmune disease."
10818533,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The adaptive immune system is responsible for the specific recognition and elimination of antigens originating
from infection and disease. It recognizes antigens via an immense array of antigen-binding antibodies (B-cell
receptors, BCRs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs), the immune repertoire. Because of the enormous breadth of
epitopes recognized by immune repertoires, immune repertoires are extremely diverse and dynamic. Advances
in immune receptor sequencing (Rep-seq), such as next generation sequencing, have driven the quantitative
and molecular-level profiling of immune repertoires, thereby revealing the high-dimensional complexity of the
immune receptor sequence landscape. However, the current analysis tools lack the ability to track and examine
the dynamic nature of the repertoire across serial time points or correlate with clinical outcomes. We propose to
use network analysis and formulate a novel ensemble feature selection approach, along with other
advanced machine learning techniques and statistical approaches (e.g., Bayesian nonparametric approach
and shrinkage estimation method), to interrogate and measure immune repertoire architecture longitudinally
and in a clinical context. Network analysis is a powerful approach that can help us identify TCRs sharing antigen
specificity and highly mutable BCR, which can help to develop or improve existing immunotherapeutics and
immunodiagnostics. To integrate gene expression data and scRep-seq data in single-cell setting, we propose to
apply the multitable mixed-membership approach to construct a network to increase the resolution of T and
B cell clusters. In addition, we assess the importance of shared clusters by introducing Bayes factor to
incorporate clonal generation probability and real data abundance. B and T cell responses develop in parallel
and influence one another, thus we will further study how BCR/TCR network properties interact, in addition to
assessing their individual response separately. We will implement the proposed methods on multiple studies to
better illustrate the diversity and richness of the data to demonstrate the flexibility and power of the proposed
tools. These studies are unique and generalizable, because they include three cancer types spanning from
immunogenic to non-immunogenic in both metastatic and localized settings with different
immunotherapeutic modalities. In addition, the proposed methods can be used to study immune response to
diseases besides cancer, including respiratory coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, first, we will
investigate the landscape of bulk Rep-seq changes over serial timepoints for prostate cancer patients who
received Sipuleucel-T and COVID-19 patients. We will develop prognostic/prediction model based on network
properties with clinical outcome/characteristics for durvalumab-treated lung cancer patients to elucidate the
clinically prognostic features of the network as well classify SARS-CoV-2 infected patients from healthy donors.
Moreover, based on unique features of single-cell RNA sequencing, we will classify the immune cells and study
the T and B cell responses to immunotherapy (CD40 agonist antibody) for esophageal and gastroesophageal
junction cancer patients. Furthermore, we will develop bioinformatics software by incorporating the proposed
methods and techniques to tackle the complexity of the immunosequencing data in a translational fashion and
provide a comprehensive platform with user-friendly visualization tools."
10818538,"Abstract
Prostate cancer has a heterogeneous prognosis, and clinicians and researchers still lack definitive means to
distinguish potentially lethal from indolent disease. Discovery of molecular biomarkers that improve the
identification of indolent versus potentially lethal prostate cancer at diagnosis would enhance the ability to
determine which patients would benefit more from immediate treatment and those who are better served by
active surveillance. Studies of the association of gene expression with lethal prostate cancer have
predominantly focused on the tumor epithelium; however, the prostate microenvironment has drawn increasing
attention as a critical driver of cancer progression. Signaling factors from the microenvironment influence the
epithelium to acquire properties such as increased motility, proliferation, and invasive behavior. Despite these
important findings, characterization of stromal gene expression has been addressed only on a small scale. We
previously identified genes associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness using expression data from pure
laser-capture microdissected stroma from 25 radical prostatectomy specimens. We additionally have shown
that DNA alterations in prostate cancer are associated with unique transcriptional programs in epithelial tissue.
We and others have determined that several of the inherited prostate cancer risk variants function as
expression Quantitative Trait Loci in tumor and normal epithelium; however, not all risk SNPs were associated
with gene expression, possibly because the impact of genetic variants is tissue specific. We now extend these
analyses to focus on gene expression of prostate stroma. We hypothesize that (1) a gene expression signature
in stroma (alone or in combination with an epithelial gene expression signature) is predictive of prostate cancer
aggressiveness and outcome; (2) prostate cancer subtypes with distinct DNA alterations are associated with
gene expression in stroma; (3) prostate cancer risk variants are associated with stromal gene expression; and
(4) the composition of cell types within the stroma surrounding the tumor may be predictive of prostate cancer
aggressiveness and outcome. To test these hypotheses, we will perform gene expression profiling of tumor-
and normal- associated stroma for ~400 prostate cancer cases (including 115 lethal cases) with existing
epithelial gene expression data from the Physicians’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study Tumor Cohort. We will also perform multiplex immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays
consisting of 1500 prostate cancer cases (117 lethal cases) to study stroma cell type composition. In our
project, we innovatively combine genetics, tumor and microenvironment biology, and biomarker development
using rigorous statistical and bioinformatics approaches. Focus on adjacent stromal tissue is potentially
transformative for clinical care by significantly adding to available epithelial molecular prognostic tests. An
improved understanding of the role of the microenvironment in tumor initiation and progression may also
potentially lead to the development of stroma-targeted therapies."
10819173,"Somatosensation is essential for everyday life. Many vertebrates, including humans, use the sense of touch to
navigate in the environment, manipulate tools and objects, find food and perform various mechanical tasks. Key
to this ability are somatosensory corpuscles located in the skin. In this proposal, we focus on Meissner
corpuscles, which are essential for performing fine tactile tasks due to their ability to detect transient mechanical
stimuli. Despite their importance for somatosensation, the mechanism of Meissner corpuscle function is
unknown. Meissner corpuscles are located in the skin of many vertebrates, and consist of lamellar cells in contact
with a neuronal mechanoreceptor. The mechanoreceptor is thought to be the key sensory element within the
corpuscle, whereas the function of lamellar cells is unknown. In this proposal, we will functionally test the
hypothesis that Meissner lamellar cells are active detectors of touch. To do this, we will use bill skin of tactile
specialist ducks, which contains a high density of Meissner corpuscles accessible for experimental
manipulations. We will investigate the molecular mechanism of touch sensitivity in Meissner lamellar cells, study
their interaction with neuronal mechanoreceptor, and investigate their role in somatosensory physiology. We will
employ an integrative approach, including neurophysiology, biophysics and imaging. Results from this basic
scientific proposal will provide mechanistic insights into the process of somatosensation in vertebrate skin."
10818659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genetic alterations in cancer cells can cause activation of regulatory factors that bind chromatin at target
gene loci to turn on transcription programs that drive tumor initiation and progression. However, despite
identification of these oncogenic regulatory factors in multiple tumor types, a gap in this rapidly evolving field is
the delineation of molecular mechanisms that open opportunities to target those regulators. Thus, my long-term
goal is to define interaction surfaces within chromatin-bound regulators critical for their oncogenic functions.
 In the F99 phase of this proposal I will focus on the transcription regulator KAP1 and its previously
unprecedented role in activating oncogenic WNT signaling in colorectal cancer (CRC). Despite the well-
established knowledge that WNT signaling drives CRC transformation and promotes tumor progression, a
therapeutic arm that successfully inactivates WNT in CRC has yet to be employed. Potentially addressing this
gap in knowledge, my studies have discovered that KAP1 is required for expression of WNT target genes in
response to oncogenic WNT stimulation. Importantly, compelling preliminary data support two non-mutually
exclusive mechanisms explaining how KAP1 may regulate WNT signaling. First, KAP1 could directly activate
WNT by scaffolding key transcriptional machinery to WNT target gene promoters using its chromatin reader
module. Second, KAP1 could interact with and regulate β-Catenin stability (the WNT transcription effector). I will
test these two models and then evaluate whether perturbing the KAP1–chromatin and/or KAP1–β-Catenin
interactions will block WNT-induced CRC phenotypes.
 In the K00 phase, I will shift focus to another biomedically relevant chromatin regulatory complex (SWI/SNF).
SWI/SNF normally remodels nucleosomes on chromatin to activate target gene expression, but its dysregulation
in cancer can cause aberrant activation of oncogenic programs. Likewise, in the soft-tissue malignancy Synovial
Sarcoma (SS), the transforming genetic alteration is translocation of SS18, a member of SWI/SNF, to the SSX
transcription factor. Because SSX, but not SSX18, normally binds modified nucleosomes, SSX abnormally
redirects SS18 to a cancer-specific set of genomic sites, causing upregulation of genes that promote
tumorigenesis. Despite this mechanistic understanding, the molecular and structural basis of the SS18-SSX–
nucleosome interaction remains unclear, and a strategy to target SS18-SSX is currently undefined. To achieve
these unmet needs, I will biophysically characterize the SS18-SSX-nucleosome interaction and then identify
small-molecule inhibitors that disrupt the SS18-SSX-nucleosome interaction. Finally, I will test lead inhibitor
candidates in hallmarks of cancer assays (proliferation and invasion).
 The training obtained under both phases will fulfill my long-term goal of running my own lab with an emphasis
on molecular mechanisms of gene regulation, allowing me to have a positive impact on cancer patients."
10885325,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), a form of chronic rejection, is a leading cause of late graft failure and
mortality after heart transplantation (HT). It is characterized by diffuse intimal thickening of the entire coronary
tree, including the epicardial coronary arteries and microvasculature. Currently, therapies are initiated after
identification of epicardial CAV on coronary angiography. However, they have limited efficacy once epicardial
disease is detected. There remain substantial unmet needs in CAV prevention and treatment, due in part to a
lack of fundamental understanding of the mechanisms early in CAV pathogenesis. The PI’s long-term career
goal is to develop into an independent physician-scientist leading a patient-oriented research program in heart
transplant biology. The PI has previously shown feasibility of performing single-nuclear RNA sequencing
(snRNA-seq) on endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) collected routinely during post-HT clinical care. The central
hypothesis of this proposal is that unique and dynamic gene regulatory networks define early and progressive
CAV. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are (1) To define dynamic cell-specific transcriptional
programs in individuals with new and progressive epicardial CAV within the first-year post-transplant; (2) To
characterize longitudinal changes in cell-specific chromatin accessibility in individuals with progressive
epicardial CAV during the first-year post-transplant; and (3) To identify transcriptional signatures that precede
CAV in PBMCs and compare relative expression to myocardial tissue. Identified genes will be highly relevant
to clinical CAV, whether serving as biomarkers preceding CAV or influencing progressive disease, and will be
prioritized for functional and clinical utility studies in the next phase of the PI’s career (i.e., R01). This work is
supported by primary co-mentors, Dr. Jane Freedman and Dr. Ravi Shah, and a multidisciplinary research
advisory committee comprising of experts in clinical heart transplantation, RNA sequencing, immunology,
bioinformatics, and multi-omics. The PI will leverage the highest-volume heart transplant center in the world
over the past three years, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, to accomplish the proposed Aims. During this
award, the PI will also complete a Master’s in Clinical Investigation and select courses in immunology,
advanced statistics, and machine learning to augment his research experience. Through the studies outlined in
this proposal, an exemplary mentorship team, and a well-defined career development plan, the PI will (1)
obtain a foundation in patient-oriented translational research, (2) develop state-of-the-art CAV molecular
phenotypes, (3) gain expertise in immunology and advanced statistical modeling of high-dimensional data, and
(4) refine professional development and scientific communication skills to successfully transition into an
independently-funded physician-scientist."

The greatest risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is aging, but the mechanisms that
link aging to ADRD disease processes are largely unknown. Of particular interest, recent single-cell transcriptomic
studies of aged hippocampal astrocytes, and multi-transcriptomic analysis of astrocytes from human AD samples
and a mouse model of AD, show commonalities in the decline of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OXPHOS) and mitophagy related pathways. Although cognitive function can decline with age, many human and
animal model subjects retain function. Current behavioral/cognitive testing paradigms are inefficient at discerning
cognitive trajectories in aging. We have developed a unique automated home-cage testing paradigm for spatial
memory that can reliably stratify cognitive performance in aged mice into cognitively ‘intact’ and ‘impaired’
subgroups. Molecular analyses show significant declines in OXPHOS genes, mitochondrial function and
concomitant increases in markers of astrogliosis specifically in ‘impaired’ mice. Whether impairments in astrocyte
mitochondrial function are a driver of reactive astrogliosis associated with cognitive impairment in aging and AD
is unresolved and is a critical question since it guides future therapeutic interventions. Our central hypothesize
is that deficits in astrocyte mitochondrial function and mitochondrial proteostasis drive reactive
astrogliosis that contribute to cognitive impairment in aging and AD, and that therapies that improve
astrocyte mitochondrial function will delay cognitive decline. The following aims are proposed: Aim 1.
Identify astrocyte subtypes with dysfunctional mitochondria in hippocampus of cognitively impaired
aged mice. We will use high resolution respirometry to measure mitochondrial function in isolated hippocampal
mitochondria from aged cognitively stratified mice. We will perform scRNAseq on hippocampal astrocytes to
identify subtypes that are specific to cognitive impairment and allow us to differentiate between healthy aging
and cognitive impairment. Aim 2. Define the role of mitochondrial proteostasis in reactive astrogliosis of
aged mice. We will assess mitochondrial protein turnover rates as well as turnover of targeted mitochondrial
proteins using D2O labeling of proteins in astrocytes from young, aged-intact and -impaired mice and determine
the contribution of mitophagy to astrocyte-mediated cognitive decline in aging. We expect these experiments will
link decreased mitochondrial protein turnover rate and mitophagy to the genesis of reactive astrogliosis and
cognitive impairment. Aim 3. Determine whether interventions that improve astrocyte mitochondrial
function alleviate cognitive impairment in aged and APP/PS1 mice. We will use AAV5-mediated
overexpression of SOD2 specifically in astrocytes delivered via stereotactic injections into the hippocampus of
cognitively stratified aged, and APP/PSI mice. We expect that the intervention will improve mitochondrial
proteostasis, reduce reactive astrogliosis, and improve cognition. These experiments are the first to address the
molecular determinants of cognitive heterogeneity in aging."
10806775,"Among the concerns of infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the
development of neurological manifestations of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or neuro-
PASC. Research shows that neuropsychiatric impairments, including cognitive problems, depression, and
anxiety are among the most common persistent symptoms (following fatigue), occurring in approximately 50%-
80% of individuals. In this Merit Review project, our multi-disciplinary team will test an overarching hypothesis
that specific inflammatory factors [e.g., monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG)], signaling pathways [e.g.,
interferon (IFN-)], genotypes (APOE4), and immunosuppressive cells contribute to the development and
persistence of neuro-PASC. Our preliminary results and published studies provide rationale for the research. We
found that individuals with neuro-PASC who experienced more severe COVID-19 have increased levels of
circulating inflammatory factors [e.g., MIG, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-)] and report increased anxiety
and depression, as compared to those with mild disease. Further, lower levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that
helps the body control inflammation, have been observed in individuals with long COVID. In addition, carriers of
the APOE4 genotype appear to be at greater risk for severe COVID-19 and PASC fatigue. Based on these and
other findings, we hypothesize that inflammatory factors in the interferon (IFN)-signaling pathway will be
positively associated with cognitive injury and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms (including increased
depression and anxiety). We also hypothesize that APOE genotype will modify the severity of neuro-PASC. We
propose three specific aims to test these hypotheses: Aim 1 will monitor and evaluate neuro-PASC symptoms
over time (baseline, 6 months and 12 months) and determine whether APOE genotype modulates severity of
neuro-PASC. Neuropsychological evaluations will assess domains most relevant to neuro-PASC (e.g., learning
and memory, attention/concentration, decision-making, and executive function). Mental health symptoms known
to be induced by inflammation and developing as a result of COVID-19 will also be evaluated. APOE genotyping
will be determined based on saliva or blood samples. Aim 2 will identify immune-related biomarkers associated
with neuro-PASC symptoms. Saliva and blood (plasma and PBMCs) samples will be collected at three timepoints
(baseline, 6 months, and 12 months) from Veterans with and without neuro-PASC. Samples will be analyzed
using a combination of ELISAs, Luminex-based multiplex assays, and Olink proteomics. Aim 3 (exploratory) will
assess neuroimaging correlates of neuro-PASC symptoms using whole brain voxel-based morphometry,
diffusion-tensor imaging, and task-based and resting-state functional connectivity. To accomplish these aims,
we have teamed up with East Tennessee VA collaborators who have unique resources (e.g., Long COVID
registry, Olink proteomics) and diverse expertise (e.g., virology, infectious diseases) to accelerate the translation
of our new advances and knowledge into clinical practice."
10807111,"Summary
Tailoring the most desired therapy to each individual patient is the primary goal of precision medicine. A
reliable and robust predictive model of drug effectiveness based on patients' unique genomic background is
the key. For decades, communities have been trying to establish the relationship between molecular
characteristics and drug response in complex diseases. Over the last decade, a large amount of genomic and
epigenomic data together with pharmacogenomics data and response to perturbations data has been
generated for many human cell lines through collaborations in the research community. These projects have
led to significant therapeutic discoveries and have provided unprecedented opportunities to predict drug
response using molecular fingerprints. However, even with great interest and effort in developing
computational methods for predicting drug response, the prediction accuracies are at best only moderate. A
related but distinct question is to understand the mechanisms of action (MOA) of drugs. Understanding drug
MOAs enables characterization of drug side effects and identification of old drugs for new uses (i.e. drug
repositioning). The traditional experimental assays to identify MOAs of drugs are expensive and time-
consuming. There are three key questions to be addressed in the study. 1. Can novel computational
approaches largely improve prediction accuracy of response to single drugs using comprehensive genomic
and chemical information? 2. Can computational approaches provide a systematic way to mine genomics and
drug response data to generate biological insights into the mechanisms of actions of various drugs? 3. Is it
possible to develop an interpretable and accurate computation model to predict drug combination effects using
pharmacogenomics data? Inherent features make it very challenging to predict drug response accurately:
High-dimensionality of input data, the complex relationship between input features and response data; and
heterogeneous drug/compound response patterns across different genetic lineages. Recently, artificial
intelligence (AI) has been making remarkable strides in various applications owing to the rapid progress of
“deep learning. In Aim 1 of this study, we will develop novel AI-based approaches to address the
computational challenges of improving the prediction accuracy of drug response. In Aim 2 of the study, we will
develop a novel computation framework to study of MOA of drugs. In Aim 3, we will develop an interpretable
deep-learning based computational framework to predict drug combination effects. In addition, we will develop
a user-friendly web portal as an integrated research platform to share the methodology, algorithms and data
generated from this proposed study to the research community."
10807115,"ABSTRACT
Cancers located within the brain, including both primary brain tumors and metastases, exhibit dismal
prognoses and do not respond well to immunotherapy, in part due to marked systemic tumor-induced
immunosuppression. Systemic immune suppression is a hallmark of IC tumors, independent of tumor type.
Systemic immune deficiencies in patients and mice with IC tumors include AIDS-level lymphopenia, lymphoid
organ contraction, and sequestration of T cells in the bone marrow (BM). BM T cell sequestration follows the
loss of T cell sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1), a surface protein that functions as an “exit visa”
mediating T cell egress from lymphoid organs. Surface levels of S1P1 can be stabilized by knocking out (KO)
β-arrestin 2 (βarr2), the protein responsible for S1P1 internalization. Unexpectedly, βarr2KO mice implanted
with IC tumors demonstrate an unprecedented ~50-80% long-term survival benefit in the absence of any
additional intervention. Both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required for this enhanced survival, and T cell
activating therapies further extend βarr2KO survival. These data suggest that βarr2KO mice mount an
enhanced T cell anti-tumor immune response in βarr2KO mice, although the mechanism of enhanced T cell
function remains unclear.
For T cells to mount an effective anti-tumor immune response and clear tumors in vivo, they must activate
Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). NF-κB functions as a “master
regulator” of inflammation, and βarr2 is a known inhibitor of NF-κB activation. Importantly, this βarr2-NF-κB
axis is regulated by the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), specifically through the beta-2 adrenergic receptor
(β2AR). SNS signaling through the β2AR increases βarr2 levels and thereby prevents NF-κB activation. SNS
overactivation in other IC pathologies has been linked to the same systemic immune deficits seen with IC
tumors, and we have evidence of increased SNS signaling in IC tumor-bearing mice. Notably, βarr2KO tumor-
bearing mice exhibit less lymphopenia and lymphoid organ contraction. Furthermore, SNS blockade abrogates
BM T cell sequestration in tumor-bearing wild-type (WT) mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that 1)
βarr2 plays a key role in restricting anti-tumor immune responses by inhibiting NF-κB, and 2) SNS
overactivation due to IC tumors may drive increased immunosuppressive βarr2 activity.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to generate mechanistic insights into tumor-driven immunosuppression
that will inform therapeutic approaches to license and improve immunotherapies. The primary objectives of this
proposal are to determine the impact of 1. βarr2 deficiency on anti-tumor T cell function and 2. IC tumor-
driven SNS overactivation on βarr2 activity and anti-tumor immunity."
10807116,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
During cell division chromosomes must be accurately segregated to produce daughter cells with the correct
numbers of chromosomes whereas segregation errors generate aneuploid cells with abnormal numbers of
chromosomes. In normal human somatic cells, chromosome segregation errors and aneuploidy are rare. In
contrast, in human totipotent and pluripotent embryonic cells meiotic and mitotic errors are common, resulting
in aneuploidy being the leading cause of miscarriages and birth defects. Yet, we do not understand the
mechanisms responsible for this, particularly for mitotic errors. Moreover, given such a high mitotic error rate,
it is proposed that diploid cells can outcompete aneuploid cells as development progresses to establish euploid
embryos, but how this occurs is unknown. We will address these gaps in our knowledge using pluripotent
human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and a combination of quantitative imaging, chemical, and genomics
approaches. The specific aims of this grant are (1) to determine the mitotic pathways responsible for
chromosome segregation errors in hESCs, (2) to determine if the G1 cell cycle structure of hESCs permits an
initial tolerance to aneuploidy, and (3) to determine how an aneuploid genome subsequently impairs hESCs
contribution to embryonic tissues. Collectively, these aims test our overarching hypothesis that pluripotent
embryonic cells are inherently different from somatic cells with respect to mechanisms that support
chromosome segregation fidelity and in their response to aneuploidy. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for our long-term objectives of identifying the molecular signaling pathways responsible for the
causes, tolerance, and consequences of aneuploidy in embryonic cells and for developing strategies that
preserve the genome integrity of embryonic cells grown in culture to improve the success of reproductive and
regenerative medicine therapies. In conclusion, this work will reveal both the mechanisms underlying
aneuploidy in embryonic cells and how karyotype stability is eventually achieved to support normal human
development."
10809024,"Project Summary / Abstract
 In the last decade there has been an explosion of resolved high-resolution structures of G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) and their complexes with several G-proteins, collectively known as transducer proteins. GPCRs
are dynamic proteins, and exist in multiple functional conformational states. Comparisons of three-dimensional
structures of the inactive and active states of GPCRs have led to identification of residue pair distances that show
distinct changes upon activation. Such residue pairs are known as “activation microswitches”. Molecular Dynamics
(MD) simulations is an attractive tool for identifying (i) the residue pairs that are critical to GPCR activation, (ii)
residue pairs involved in allosteric communication from the ligand binding site to the G protein coupling site, and (iii)
residue pairs in the GPCR:G protein interfaces that contribute to their coupling strength and selectivity.
 While our ability to generate long time scale dynamics trajectories have increased exponentially, the results of
MD simulations have largely been analyzed using prior knowledge of the GPCRs. There is a critical need for
adopting the unbiased, data-driven, systems biology tools to analyze long time scale MD trajectories data to mine
knowledge on the residue motions that provide information on allosteric communication network in GPCRs. Our
overarching goal in this grant is to apply Bayesian Network (BN) modeling, an interpretable machine learning
methodology, to the MD simulation trajectories data on GPCR:G protein complexes in order to identify the residues in
various GPCR structural regions that contribute to ligand selectivity. Network-centered approaches have not been
used, so far, to analyze high-dimensional residue pairs MD simulation data. BN modeling, in particular, has attractive
properties (interpretability, probabilistic nature of the data representation, statistical validation, tools for topology
comparison and analysis) that presently deployed secondary MD simulation data analysis methods, such as principal
component analysis (PCA) of residue pairs, lack.
 We propose to use BN modeling with large scale MD trajectories (multiple short and multiple long trajectories)
of inactive state GPCRs and fully active state GPCR:G protein complexes to (i) identify the activation microswitches,
the residue pairs that show large scale conformational changes upon activation, and (ii) outline the residue network
involved in the allosteric communication from the agonist binding site to the G-protein coupling sites. We will also (iii)
identify the residues in the GPCR:G protein interface that contribute to selectivity in coupling to specific family of G
proteins (Gs, Gi and Gq). In aim 2, we will (iv) dissect time-correlated events using BN series and dynamic BN (DBN)
models to delineate and scrutinize the residue networks that lead to large scale transitions.
 Importantly, the deliverables will include an unprecedented “toolkit” (algorithms + software) incorporating
system biology tools for analyzing MD simulation trajectories data that are generalizable to any protein complexes."
10809026,"Pathogenesis of coronary artery disease is complex, with multiple cell types contributing to lesion size
and composition. Acute coronary syndromes are most often associated with rupture of complex,
vulnerable plaques that are otherwise clinically benign. The progression to either a relatively benign,
stable lesion or a rupture-prone, vulnerable plaque has been linked to key lesion characteristics, i.e.
smooth muscle (SM) and collagen content, macrophage infiltration and necrotic core area within the
lesion. The objectives of this proposal are to 1) determine the SM-specific role and underlying
mechanism(s) by which the intermediate conductance, Ca2+-activated K+ channel, KCa3.1 (encoded by
Kcnn4), dictates atherosclerotic lesion formation and composition and 2) determine the translational
potential of clinically approved KCa3.1 inhibitors on lesion development in a large mammal model of
coronary artery disease (CAD). In support, we provide the first genetic evidence of a causal link
between KCa3.1 and lesion size and SM and macrophage recruitment. The overall hypothesis is that
KCa3.1 activation increases migration of SM and macrophages into the intima and contributes to lesion
formation. Conversely, blocking KCa3.1, both by genetic silencing or pharmacologically, will decrease
atherosclerotic lesion size and beneficially alter composition. Aim 1 will determine the contribution of
KCa3.1 in smooth muscle to atherosclerotic lesion formation and composition. Specifically, we will use
SM-specific, inducible KO mice to examine the role of KCa3.1 in determining plaque size, composition
and gene expression. Aim 2 will define both upstream (REST) and downstream (DOCK2) mechanisms
determining KCa3.1 effects on SM and atherosclerosis. We will use genetically modified mice to
examine the role of REST and DOCK2 in mediating SM effects of KCa3.1 on phenotype, proliferation,
migration, plaque size and composition. In addition, we will use RNA sequencing to identify novel
mechanisms of atherosclerosis development by KCa3.1. We will use VSM lineage-tracking in Aim 3 will
use SM lineage-tracking to determine role of SMC-KCa3.1 in mediating SMC intimal to medial migration
and foam cell transdifferentiation during atherosclerotic lesion development. Finally, Aim 4 will
determine the effect of the FDA approved KCa3.1 inhibitor, senicapoc, on atherosclerosis development
in a swine model of CAD. We longitudinally track coronary artery disease progression using
angiography and IVUS in familial hypercholesterolemic (FH) swine to test the ability of KCa3.1 inhibition
with senicapoc, to decrease the size and promote a more favorable composition of coronary lesions.
The long-term goal is to provide the pre-clinical foundation for translating current therapeutic tools and
developing the next generation drugs targeting KCa3.1 and/or downstream signaling to beneficially
manipulate atherosclerotic lesion composition."

20–68% of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients exhibit trauma-associated olfactory deficits (OD) which can
compromise not only the quality of life but also cognitive and neuropsychiatric functions. Although post-
traumatic anosmia has been documented in the medical literature for more than a century, neither the
underlying mechanisms nor treatment remain clear. Moreover, the occurrence of TBI significantly increases
risk for the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or non-AD forms of dementia. Recent studies of OD have
focused its potential as an early biomarker for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders and their disease
progression. Thus, TBI survivors with OD may be an early sign heralding its progression to dementia. AD
pathogenesis revealed that the peripheral olfactory pathways including the olfactory bulb (OB) are the potential
structural candidates responsible for OD in prodromal AD. Emerging studies have associated OD with the
presence of OB inflammatory response, suggesting that OB pathology may provide a mechanistic link between
TBI and AD or dementia. Recent data indicate that TBI-induced rapid and persistent pro-inflammatory
responses in the OB were accompanied by increased phosphorylated tau and OB atrophy, resulting in early
and persistent olfactory deficits. New data indicate that microglia-mediated inflammation contributed to
neuronal hyperexcitation in the OB which was mitigated in the absence of Hv1, a newly discovered microglial
ion channel required for NADPH oxidase-dependent generation of reactive oxygen species. Based on these
findings and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that early after TBI microglial Hv1-mediated inflammation in
the OB contributes to hyperexcitation of local neurons leading to olfactory dysfunction, thus heralding its
progression to late-onset neurodegeneration.
 With multidisciplinary approaches including the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer
Drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic inhibition of OB microglia, microglia-specific and inducible Hv1 KO
mice combined with microscopy and biochemical approaches, and comprehensive neurobehavioral testing, we
will examine neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the OB in a well-established controlled cortical
impact mouse TBI model and their correlation with OD and late-onset dementia-like behaviors (AIM 1).
Furthermore, powerful in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological approaches will be applied to characterize
detrimental effects of TBI-induced inflammation on network and synaptic functions in the OB (AIM 2). Lastly,
we will determine whether genetic or pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory pathways in the OB through
intranasal delivery mitigates TBI-induced inflammation and neurodegeneration thus improves functional
outcomes (AIM 3).
 Our study will be the first to link olfactory dysfunction to dementia and neurodegeneration following TBI.
Our findings will potentially shed light on developing effective approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of
TBI-associated OD in the development of neurodegeneration and dementia."

 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a growing sleep-related breathing disorder with the prevalence rate of
10-15% in the middle-age adults and of 32%-62% in elderly. OSA patients undergo recurrent upper airway
collapse due to suppression of activity of upper airway dilator muscles during sleep, which causes repeated
hypoxia, frequent stressful arousals and sleep deprivation. OSA has a major health impact due to its
association with cardiovascular, metabolic and neurocognitive morbidities, including a risk factor for developing
Alzheimer’s disease and increased mortality in older adults.
 Brainstem noradrenergic (NA) system plays an important role in maintaining the tonus of upper airway
(UA) muscles to keep airway open during wakefulness. Therefore, the decrease of NA release during sleep
largely contributes to a loss of the UA muscle tone at night, which is a major neurological cause of OSA.
Studies suggest that aging has a detrimental effect on the NA system. However, there is little information
regarding age-related changes in the control of UA muscles by brainstem NA neurons, which may be a basis
of the increased prevalence of OSA in older population.
 In the proposed project, we will use a novel molecular-genetic approach that will allow a cell-type-specific
activation of NA neurons in the brainstem A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubCorelueus (SubC) nuclei while recording
activity of the genioglossus (GG), a major UA dilator muscle, during natural sleep and wakefulness in young (3-
4 months) and old (16-20 months) behaving DBH-Cre mice. We will determine the age-related changes in 1)
the ability of A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubC neurons to activate the GG muscle; 2) the contribution of A1/C1, A5, A7
and SubC neurons to depression of the GG muscle activity during NREM sleep and REM sleep; 3) the
number of NA neurons in these and other brainstem NA nuclei; and 4) the density of axons and their terminals
that originate from A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubC neurons and project to hypoglossal and other UA motoneurons.
 The proposed work will reveal neurological bases of the reduction in effectiveness of UA muscles to
maintain UA open during sleep in older individuals. The results of this study will fill a major gap in our
understanding of underlying mechanisms of OSA pathogenesis in elderly and lay the groundwork for
translational research of OSA pathology in aging to develop preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for clinical
management of OSA in older patients."

This application proposes research designed to provide solid mechanistic underpinnings for immunotherapy
and vaccination to prevent and treat atherosclerosis. Vaccination with MHC-II restricted peptide epitopes from
apolipoprotein B (ApoB) ameliorates atherosclerosis by inducing ApoB-specific regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs).
I have developed reagents (tetramers and dextramers) to detect and isolate these ApoB-specific Tregs at the
single cell level in mice and humans. The proposed work has a T cell aspect, currently supported by R01
HL121697 (2014-2018), and a vascular macrophage aspect, currently supported by R01 HL115232 (2012-
2022). To gain better mechanistic insight, I propose to adoptively transfer ApoB-specific Tregs (if necessary
expanded in Rag2-/- mice) into recipient mice and measure atherosclerosis. I will also transfer ApoB peptide-
specific antibodies to formally test possible antibody effects, and test the role of B cells in two B cell-deficient
mouse lines. I will study changes in functions of vascular macrophages in vivo after vaccination. To improve
the vaccine efficacy, I propose to test vaccine formulations similar to what would be used clinically, test the
atherosclerosis vaccines in two other mouse models of atherosclerosis (Apoe-/- on chow diet, Ldlr-/- on high fat
diet), optimize the vaccination protocol, and add low-dose IL-2 to stabilize Tregs. To discover how and why
Tregs switch to effector T cells, I will use FoxP3 (the Treg defining transcription factor) lineage tracker mice.
TCR-Seq will test the hypothesis that the apparent switch is caused by an outgrowth of a minor population of
pro-inflammatory ApoB-specifc CD4 T cells. To test cell-exogenous factors, I will incubate ApoB-specific CD4
T cells with explanted normal or atherosclerotic aortas, and measure epigenetic changes by DNA and histone
methylation around the FoxP3 locus. To prepare for translating the vaccine into humans, I propose more
human work, including mass cytometry (CyTOF) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with 42-
“color” panels. Barcoded scRNA-Seq to obtain single cell transcriptomes will define the cell types more deeply.
I propose to expand the current clinical data set (all women, most HIV+) to both genders and HIV-. When this
work is completed, we will have a good understanding how atherosclerosis vaccination works. We will have
extensive human data for the phenotype of ApoB-specific CD4 T cells in PBMCs collected from cardiovascular
disease cases and controls."

Postmortem examination remains critical to elucidate the etiology in cases of dementia and to confirm the
diagnosis of AD, despite recent advances in neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers. Autopsy is also critical for
confirming the clinical diagnosis and identifying comorbidities, which are common in older subjects. The
Neuropathology Core (Core D) of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (JHADRC) has
three overarching goals. The first is to conduct postmortem neuropathological assessments in subjects
enrolled in the JHADRC Clinical Core. Second, to prepare, store, and distribute autopsy brain tissues for
research. The third goal is the training of young physicians and neuroscientists in the neuropathology of
dementias and neurodegenerative diseases. The specific aims of Core D are as follows: (1) to arrange and
perform autopsies on clinically well-characterized subjects enrolled through the JHADRC and assist with
consensus diagnoses on JHADRC subjects, (2) to store optimally prepared tissues from the autopsies and to
make these specimens available to investigators associated with the JHADRC and at other collaborating
institutions, (3) to integrate the neuropathologic data from these cases with the clinical and biomarker data
acquired in the same participants, using the JHADRC database, and to submit the neuropathology data to the
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), working with the Data Core (4) to support the assessment
of genetically engineered mouse models relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related disorders, and (5) to
train basic investigators and clinical neuroscientists in the morphological and diagnostic concepts relevant to
AD, to other types of dementias and neurodegenerative disorders (including trainees supported by the REC).
In addition, the availability of human brain postmortem tissues has become increasingly important for validating
research hypotheses and for investigations and development of biomarkers of AD. Core D will therefore be
expanding its postmortem tissue collection to include a large number of specimens from younger subjects (30
to 65 years) suitable to examine the very early stages of AD pathology and its pathogenesis."

passed on to progeny virions. While there are numerous therapeutics in clinical use, there are currently no gRNA
packaging or viral assembly inhibitors. Selective gRNA packaging is facilitated by interactions between the HIV-
1 Gag protein and conserved gRNA elements within the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR). Here, we focus on recent
unexpected findings in HIV-1 RNA biology that revealed sequence heterogeneity at the 5′ end of the HIV-1 RNA
transcript. The variable number of G residues (1G, 2G and 3G) has been reported to affect the gRNA localization,
with 1G RNA preferentially selected over 3G to be the viral genome. This is very surprising given that these two
9-kb RNAs only differ by 2 nucleotides. Preliminary data presented here strongly support the enrichment of 1G-
containing transcripts among packaged gRNA. Importantly, various point mutants that abrogate the preference
for 1G RNA have been identified. Exciting preliminary data support our major hypothesis that the ensemble of
RNA structures adopted by the 5′UTR is significantly altered in 1G vs. 3G transcripts. These data provide a
strong starting point for the proposed studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism by which transcriptional start
site choice modulates gRNA packaging selectivity. More broadly, we will gain insights into how subtle sequence
changes can alter the ensemble of 5′UTR RNA structures and impact viral replication fitness. The specific aims
are: (1) To probe wild-type and mutant retroviral gRNA structure and dynamics; (2) To probe wild-type and
mutant HIV-1 Gag RNA binding and packaging specificity. The results of these studies will help guide the design
of novel therapeutic agents that target the 5′UTR and interfere with the essential conformational plasticity and/or
key binding interactions with the expectation for a lower rate of mutational escape than conventional drugs."

O-linked ß-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a sugar attachment to the side chain hydroxyl of a serine or
threonine residue on proteins. O-GlcNAcylation controls key signaling and biological processes such as signal
transduction, transcription, cell cycle progression, and metabolism. Perturbations in O-GlcNAc homeostasis
have been linked with diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. Increased glucose levels channel flux
through the Hexoseamine Biosynthetic Pathway (HBP), culminating in increased O-GlcNAc levels.
The activity of HBP and consequently cellular O-GlcNAc-ylation are elevated in several cancer types, including
breast cancer. We recently reported that inhibiting HBP activity significantly decreased the invasive phenotype
of breast tumor cells. We surmised that abundance of glucose, a readily-metabolizable carbohydrate, will drive
flux through HBP, resulting in enrichment of a portfolio of proteins that are modified by O-GlcNAc-ylation. Using
unbiased proteomics analysis, we identified that elevated glucose culture conditions enrich for O-GlcNAc-
modified GLI proteins, transcription factors of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway. Importantly, we identified that in
elevated glucose conditions, O-GlcNAc-modification of GLI exacerbates Hh/GLI activity; and inhibiting HBP
mitigated this effect. We hypothesize that HBP-directed O-GlcNAc-ylation fundamentally programs invasive and
chemoresistant attributes in tumor cells through activating Hh/GLI signaling.
In Aim 1 we will determine the molecular underpinnings of HBP-directed O-GlcNAc-ylation of GLI. We will
determine the causes and consequences of GLI O-GlcNAc-ylation. We will first identify engagement of the HBP
in O-GlcNAc-modification of GLI proteins. Next, we will undertake investigations to identify establish the
mechanistic basis of how HBP signaling engages O-GlcNAc-modified GLI to program invasive and
chemoresistant attributes in tumor cells.
In Aim 2 we will evaluate the impact of an elevated O-GlcNAc landscape on molecular and cellular attributes of
the mammary tumor and the associated immune microclimate using two distinct and complementary syngeneic
mouse models of mammary cancer. To enrich the relevance, we will also evaluate human TNBC and PDX model
systems. We will test if inhibiting GLI activity, in the context of elevated O-GlcNAc, uncouples the influence of O-
GlcNAc-ylation on invasive and chemoresistant attributes of mammary tumor cells.
Relevance: Our proposed studies are structured to systematically investigate how O-GlcNAc-driven metabolic
reprogramming in cancer cells connects at the molecular level to aberrantly activate Hh/GLI signaling. The
cumulative outcomes will create mechanistic understanding of how O-GlcNAc-ylation programs tumor invasion,
progression and response to anti-neoplastics."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is associated with disproportionate deficits in the psychosocial determinants of health,
with individuals exhibiting recovery capital (i.e. recovery resources) that is one standard deviation below that of
other substance use disorders (SUDs) in the first year of recovery. OUD medications (MOUDs) are first-line
treatments (Txs) that facilitate recovery by addressing the biophysiological disturbances caused by chronic
opioid misuse. Yet, high rates of MOUD discontinuation and associated risks are ongoing concerns and, even
when patients (Ps) are retained in Tx, psychosocial deficits often persist, increasing biobehavioral stress and
hindering Tx/recovery. Thus, without a foundation of resources for recovery support/maintenance, current and
former MOUD Ps are at ongoing risk for psychosocial impairment, which hinders recovery. The provision of
recovery support services (RSS) offers one way to address extra-Tx needs and enhance recovery capital to
ensure a safety net of resources and healthy coping skills to support MOUD Ps during and after Tx. Recovery
Community Centers (RCCs) are a free, newly emerging, and rapidly growing tier of RSS that serve as ‘one-stop-
shops’ for recovery capital, offering an array of services catered to the SUD community. RCCs seem to be
especially well suited for MOUD Ps, as they operate under the maxim “many pathways [to recovery], all should
be celebrated” (including MOUD), and the majority of RCC attendees have OUD and hold positive attitudes
toward MOUD. Though early evidence suggests that RCCs can aid SUD recovery, its potential benefit to MOUD
Ps has yet to be directly studied. Also, few MOUD Ps know of or use RCCs, and clinical linkage to them is
uncommon. Thus, this 5-year project seek to advance our understanding of the clinical and public health utility
of RCCs and help bridge the gap between clinical Tx and community-based RSS. As a first step in this work, we
will develop and test a new intervention for peer-facilitated assertive linkage of MOUD Ps to RCCs (RCCL),
relative to a matched control condition (CC). This study aims to: (1) develop, manualize, and refine RCCL/CC
protocols via stakeholder feedback; (2) determine feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy (RCC
attendance, service use, recovery capital) of RCCL vs. CC, via a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT); (3) Gain
in-depth insight to RCCL via qualitative interviews. This study will be the first to test RCCL for MOUD Ps,
providing a foundation for larger-scale RCTs, with the potential to ultimately change clinical practice paradigms
to address Ps’ extra-Tx needs and inform our ability to expand RCCL provision nationally. The aims support
advanced training in: psychosocial determinants of health; RSS; intervention development/testing (via RCT);
qualitative methods; ongoing OUD training, with a new focus on intervention research. Training will be fulfilled
with expert guidance from Drs. John Kelly, Roger Weiss, Joanne Neale, David Best, Christine Timko, and Corrie
Vilsaint. The training and experience provided by this award will serve as a critical foundation from which to build
a an important and clinically relevant program of independent research."
10796933,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Visual hallucinations affect approximately 20% of Alzheimer disease and 50% of all Parkinson disease
patients. Hallucinations are a leading source of patient and caregiver distress and are an independent risk
factor for injury, nursing home placement, and mortality. Because treatment options for hallucinations are
limited and have significant adverse effect risks, the prevention of hallucinations would have a transformative
public health impact for older adults with neurodegenerative disease. Visual impairment is a risk factor for
hallucinations, and since up to half of all vision loss in the U.S. is preventable or treatable, the prevention and
treatment of ophthalmic disease could prevent or reduce the severity of hallucinations in older adults. However,
studies of specific age-related eye diseases and hallucination outcomes are lacking, limiting these
improvements in healthcare. This proposal requests support for a mentored career development award for Dr.
Ali Hamedani, a neurology-trained neuro-ophthalmologist and epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
The overarching goal of this project is to understand how visual pathway structure, function, diseases, and
treatments contribute to hallucinations in older adults. In Aim 1, Dr. Hamedani will analyze longitudinal data
from two Medicare-linked national health surveys (the National Health and Aging Trends Study and Health and
Retirement Study) to determine whether age-related macular degeneration, primary open-angle glaucoma, and
cataract surgery are associated with the incidence of hallucinations in a nationally representative sample of
5,200 high-risk older adults using advanced survival analysis with marginal structural models to account for
time-dependent confounding. In Aim 2, Dr. Hamedani will recruit a prospective cohort of Parkinson disease
patients who are beginning a medication for hallucinations to determine whether low-contrast acuity and retinal
ganglion cell thickness are associated with hallucination severity and treatment response. In executing these
aims, Dr. Hamedani will be obtain additional training in ophthalmic epidemiology, retinal imaging, and
biostatistics under the mentorship of experts in optical coherence tomography and ophthalmic clinical
investigation (Joel Schuman, MD) and neurodegenerative disease epidemiology and health services research
(Allison Willis, MD MSCI). The results of this project will provide fundamental knowledge about the visual
system’s role in causing hallucinations and pave the way for future studies to test visual impairment and
ophthalmic disease as a prevention target for hallucinations and other neurocognitive outcomes in older adults.
Through the research training and mentorship experience gained during this career development award, Dr.
Hamedani will establish himself as an independent investigator in the applied epidemiology and outcomes
research of ophthalmology in aging and neurodegenerative disease."
10794536,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Abdominal pain is the most common gastrointestinal issue and is a major feature of irritable bowel syndrome
and inflammatory bowel disease. Visceral hypersensitivity has emerged as a key pathophysiological mechanism
for pain, but effective therapies are limited because the causal mechanisms whereby nociceptors become
sensitized remain largely unresolved, are heterogeneous, sexually dimorphic, and influenced by inflammation
and experiencing adverse early life events. Recent data show that enteric glia exhibit bi-directional
communication with nociceptors and alter sensory transduction during acute and chronic inflammation. The
overall goal of this proposal is to define glial mechanisms that sensitize visceral nerve fibers in a context and
sex-specific manner. This proposal tests the central hypothesis that enteric glia promote visceral hypersensitivity
through sexually dimorphic mechanisms that are influenced by acute inflammation and early life adversity. This
dual hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims that utilize glial and nociceptor calcium imaging, glial
chemogenetics, novel transgenic lines to perturb glial signaling mechanisms, and models of visceral pain driven
by acute inflammation and early life adversity. Aim 1 will use the DNBS colitis model to test the hypothesis that
enteric glia regulate visceral hypersensitivity through sexually dimorphic mechanisms during acute inflammation.
Aim 1.1 will involve cellular imaging studies where GCaMPs are expressed in nociceptive nerves or glia, glial
chemogenetics, in vitro measurements of gliotransmitter release, and in vivo visceromotor response recordings
to test the hypothesis that glia contribute to female susceptibility in visceral nociception by exhibiting greater
sensing, signal transduction, and transmitter release mechanisms than males. Aim 1.2 will use novel conditional
glial gene ablation models to test the hypothesis that differences in how glia control endocannabinoids and
histamine promote sex differences in susceptibility to developing pain following acute inflammation. Aim 2 will
use the neonatal maternal separation stress model to test the hypothesis that early life adversity promotes male
biased visceral hypersensitivity through a pathophysiological shift in gliotransmission. Aim 2.1 will use glial and
nociceptor GCaMP models in cellular imaging studies, in vitro measurements of gliotransmitter release, and in
vivo visceromotor response recordings to test the hypothesis that early life stress causes a shift from
physiological to pathophysiological gliotransmission mechanisms in males. Aim 2.2 will use protein and RNA
labeling, glial gene ablation models, cellular imaging and in vivo visceromotor recordings to test the hypothesis
that increased glial endocannabinoid degradation and decreased histamine clearance contribute to male biased
pain following early life adversity. The results of this study will provide novel insight into glial mechanisms that
regulate sensory transduction through mechanisms that differ based on acute inflammation, sex, and prior life
experiences. This knowledge can be used to develop new therapies that ultimately benefit the treatment of
visceral pain."

This application is entitled “Gut microbial dietary phenylalanine metabolism and heart failure”. There is rapidly growing
awareness of the significant role of diet and the gut microbiome to human health and disease. Here we examine how
differences in macronutrient metabolism between subjects at risk for heart failure are linked to changes in gut microbial
community structure and function, and contribute to disease (heart failure) etiology. Specifically, how alterations in gut
microbial phenylalanine metabolism impacts patient risks for development of disease, and multiple pathophysiologic
mechanisms linked to heart failure relevant phenotypes. Our studies reveal how altered microbial metabolism of
phenylalanine, an essential macronutrient, alters metabolic homeostasis, examined new biomarkers of both heart
failure development risk, and how protein diet / nutrient exposure alters susceptibility to disease.
The studies explore a meta-organismal pathway (involving both microbes, and host enzymes) for a metabolite linked
to cardiovascular disease, with focus on heart failure. We identify in preliminary studies striking clinical associations
between microbe dependent metabolites derived from dietary phenylalanine, and heart failure development. And
in preliminary animal model studies, observe recapitulation of these clinical observations extending to evidence
of a causal link between gut microbial metabolite generation and multiple heart failure related phenotypes. Our
studies aim to explore whether nutrient intake (dietary protein), via gut microbe dependent changes in host
metabolism (metabolite levels), is linked to adaptive physiological responses, and when in excess, maladaptive
effects on myocardial function and remodeling. The studies proposed are multidisciplinary, ranging from human
clinical observational studies, to more mechanistic microbial engineering, cellular, and preclinical disease model
investigations. Defined microbial contributors to the metaorganismal pathway are examined in model gnotobiotic
systems designed to recapitulate the complex microbial community / host integrated network that collectively
contribute to the metabolic and physiological effects observed in vivo. Successful completion of the proposed
studies will further advance our knowledge of how dietary nutrients, through the filter of our gut microbial
community, can impact host metabolism, physiology and disease etiology."
10806442,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite a characteristic indolent course, a substantial subset of follicular lymphoma (FL) patients has an early
relapse with a poor outcome. Thus far, efforts to identify factors that predict survival have been unsuccessful.
However, we and others have demonstrated the prognostic relevance of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in
FL and provided initial evidence for the role of specific genetic alterations in shaping different environments with
highly dissimilar clinical courses. Yet, the crosstalk between malignant B cells and other immune cells of the
TME is poorly understood, as is the role of molecular alterations in modulating this interplay. This underscores
the urgent need to improve our understanding of how tumor-immune interactions may drive lymphomagenesis
and represent therapeutic vulnerabilities. Through massive genetic and transcriptomic sequencing, we found
that FL patients with increased expression of IRF4, an NF-kB target with a critical role in B cell differentiation,
display dysregulated immune signatures and an immunosuppressive TME with a poor prognosis. We
hypothesize that increased IRF4 expression disrupts the immune synapse between B cells and T follicular helper
(TFH) cells while promoting suppressive T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells, in part by preventing induction of
selection molecules such as CD40 and PDL1, and in part by rewiring cytokines release. To test our hypothesis,
we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use novel transgenic mouse models with overexpression and
deletion of irf4 to investigate whether and how IRF4 controls tumor immunity in normal and malignant B cells by
integrating single-cell transcriptional and translational (CITE-seq) analysis. In Aim 2, we will use high dimensional
cytometry (CyTOF), spatially resolved proteomics (CODEX), and CITE-seq in the same mouse models to define
the effect of B cells with different IRF4 status on TFH cells. In Aim 3, we will use single-cell transcriptomic and
proteomic tools to elucidate the role of TFR cells in response to B cells differently expressing IRF4. The findings
of all aims will be validated in human FL samples.
Building on her substantial prior laboratory and clinical experience in B cell lymphoma, Dr. Patrizia Mondello will
lead these studies under the dual mentorship of Dr. Stephen Ansell, a leader in immunotherapy and TME in
lymphoma at Mayo Clinic, and Dr. Laura Pasqualucci, a world expert in the genetics and epigenetics of B cell
lymphoma at Columbia University. Mayo Clinic offers an exceptional environment for cultivating a developing
career in translational cancer research. To achieve the long-term goal of becoming a successful independent
investigator, Dr. Mondello has developed a structured curriculum of activities aimed at broadening her knowledge
base, expanding her technical repertoire, and developing leadership skills. She has also assembled an advisory
committee of leading scientists. In completing her proposed plan with this team, Dr. Mondello will be prepared
to compete for R01 funding and to launch a translational research program studying the dysregulation and
therapeutic targeting of chromatin modifiers and transcription factors and their effect on the TME in lymphoma."

 MUC1, the heavily glycosylated cell-surface mucin, is altered in both expression and glycosylation patterns in
human carcinomas of the epithelium. Tumor-specific glycopeptide epitopes of MUC1 are recognized by a variety
of lectin receptors on immune cells. These interactions have not been extensively studied, despite the fact that
aberrant tumor glycosylation alters how the immune system perceives the tumor and can also induce
immunosuppressive signaling leading to the creation of a pro-tumor microenvironment favoring tumor
progression and metastasis. In addition, it has recently been proposed that the tumor glycocode may be
considered a novel immune checkpoint. In this renewal application, we will continue to examine epitope
heterogeneity, the glycoside cluster effect, and the steric hindrance effect of neighboring glycans on binding to
lectins (Aim 1). Specifically, we will focus on the design of novel synthetic tools such as a) structurally well-
defined MUC1 glycopeptides with varying multivalency and b) MUC1-derived positional scanning synthetic
glycopeptide combinatorial library (PS-SGCL) displaying native-like heterogeneous and aberrant O-glycan
epitopes, sialylated Tn and Thomsen–Friedenreich (TF) antigens. The thermodynamic profile of the interaction
of MUC1-derived glycopeptides with macrophage galactose-specific lectin (hMGL) and Siglecs (-7, -9 and/or -
15) will be assessed by ITC. The binding kinetics will be determined by direct measurement of the strength of
unbinding of receptor-ligand interactions by AFM (Aim 2). We are particularly interested in how protein scaffold
contributes to the interactions with lectins and also the role of water in protein hydration and the binding complex
formation with the ligand. All these are known variables that may impact the receptor targeting efficacy and
immune response induced by immune cells. Furthermore, this renewal application proposes to use MUC1
glycopeptides and PS-SGCLs in the discovery and assessment of binding specificities of anti-MUC1 antibodies
found in sera from cancer patients with MUC1+ tumors (Aim 3). We are focusing on the identification of a new
class of antibodies targeting ""dynamic glycopeptide neoepitopes"". In addition to the research aims, we will
continue to recruit the next generation of scientists into the glycoscience field by offering exciting research
opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at the interface of chemistry and immunology. In
summary, the proposed study will facilitate a deeper understanding of the principles of glycan-protein interactions
and general rules that govern the ability of lectins to regulate immune response by engaging glycoproteins on
the cell surface. This may constitute an important roadmap for translating fundamental MUC1 glycobiology
knowledge toward next-generation cancer immunotherapies."

Alcohol and methamphetamine use increases risk of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) and
numerous interventions have been developed to decrease HIV acquisition and transmission among substance
using MSM. Yet, despite a considerable body of research documenting these associations, substantial
uncertainty remains regarding the specific behavioral pathways between substance use and HIV that are most
responsible for this elevated risk (e.g., condom use, sexual partner selection, or HIV medication adherence).
Without this knowledge, it is difficult to identify the extent to which substance use drives HIV among MSM or
estimate the population level impact of interventions among substance using MSM. In addition, substance use,
adherence, risk reduction, and combined interventions have all shown excellent promise to reduce HIV
incidence, but large-scale comparative effectiveness trials are extremely challenging and costly and can
seldom comprehensively examine the unique value of these interventions to specific subgroups (e.g., by
race/ethnicity or age). Accordingly, this project seeks to 1) synthesize data on the relationship between alcohol,
methamphetamine, and HIV among MSM, including the impact of substance use on HIV risk behavior and the
prevention-care continuum, 2) estimate the plausible range and sources of HIV infections attributable to
alcohol and methamphetamine use among MSM using a principled and widely-used approach to network
epidemic models (i.e., EpiModel), and 3) determine optimal and robust strategies for reducing HIV incidence
among substance using MSM. For each aspect of this work, we will leverage advanced statistical and
computational tools to rigorously calibrate our models, validate them against independent data sources, and
perform extensive sensitivity analysis. To increase the usefulness of these models for real-world decision
making, we will utilize uncertainty quantification to ensure the identified strategies are most likely to succeed
after accounting for potential inaccuracy in our model parameters and assumptions. All model development will
be conducted using open-source software enabling easy replication, modification, and extensions by other
researchers. The project's team is exceptionally well positioned to achieve these goals with expertise spanning
network analysis, drug use epidemiology, epidemic modeling, and high-performance computing. Finally,
dissemination activities are designed to directly inform key stakeholders in order to reduce HIV incidence and
maximize the impact of this project on HIV elimination efforts."

 Brian Chan MD MPH is an internist and health services researcher passionate about improving health
outcomes for vulnerable patients with opioid use disorder (OUD). This career development award will establish
Dr. Chan as a clinician-investigator focused on implementing and disseminating novel primary care
interventions that target high-risk patients with OUD in safety-net settings. The K23 award provides mentored
training to develop expertise in 3 areas: 1) conduct of mixed-methods research to develop deployment-focused
interventions; 2) clinical trial design and implementation science; and 3) addiction medicine treatment in
federally qualified health center (FQHC) settings. To achieve these goals, Dr. Chan has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentoring team with expertise in health services research, addiction medicine, intervention
design and implementation science, and FQHC health systems, with success in mentoring faculty to research
independence.
 In 2018, 2.1 million people had an opioid use disorder (OUD) related to heroin or prescription pain
relievers. While the recognition of OUD is increasing, few patients receive evidence-based treatment. This is
particularly true for medically complex patients with OUD in safety-net settings. OUD complicates management
of other chronic medical conditions and is associated with high utilization of healthcare resources. Health
systems are interested in risk stratifying complex patients to improve targeting of interventions, like ambulatory
intensive care teams (A-ICU); these could be adapted for complex patients with OUD, but scalability limit
dissemination. Informed by his clinical experience as an internist and data from his K12 award evaluating an A-
ICU for medically complex high-utilizers in an FQHC, Dr. Chan will complete the following 3 aims: 1) Adapt an
existing A-ICU intervention to address high complexity patients with OUD using community stakeholder
engaged methods; 2) Refine the intervention through an iterative implementation case study, and identify
measures of acceptability, feasibility, and implementation strategy; 3) Evaluate and pilot a randomized trial of
the intervention to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the refined intervention to
improve clinical outcomes, and retention in OUD treatment at a FQHC using implementation and mixed-
methods. The results provide preliminary data for a future R01 proposal pragmatic efficacy trial of the refined
intervention at multiple FQHC sites. This proposal directly aligns with the priorities of the National Institute on
Drug Abuse’s strategic planning workgroup on the “complexity of substance use disorders” and its priority to
“develop and test strategies for effectively and sustainably implementing evidence-based treatments.”
Completion of these studies will pave the way for implementing scalable primary care interventions to narrow
OUD treatment gaps and improve care for high-risk populations."
10808937,"This proposal presents a vision for my research program over the next five years. My lab is engaged in the
application and development of multiscale computational methods to study biomolecular systems, with main
driver interests in non-enveloped virus capsids, biomembranes and protein dynamics. Through these studies we
will provide modeling tools, gain insights into the regulation and mechanisms of biomolecular functions and apply
deep learning methods to gain a new comprehension of protein communication and conformational changes.
The main motivation in our viral capsid studies is to understand the determinants and molecular mechanisms of
infection processes leading to capsid uncoating/disassembly. Our work on virus systems will expand into the
genus of Enteroviruses, which include severe health threats such as poliovirus, EV-A71 and EV-D68. There are
numerous high resolution structures of mature, uncoating intermediates and genome released states of
enteroviruses which enable this research direction. Significant findings from these studies will include detailed
structural and energetic information regarding viral infection related processes, which will be valuable in the
development of anti-viral therapies against these agents. Our interests in biomembranes are centrally related to
how bilayer lipid composition and shape affect the structure, dynamics and functional properties of lipids,
peptides and proteins. Our work on virus capsids and biomembranes will involve multi-resolution approaches
including atomistically resolved and coarse-grained models. For virus capsids, coarse-grained models will be
advanced to study uncoating and genome release and software will be developed and distributed for this
purpose. Our work on biomembranes will be supported by the continued development and enhancement of our
BUMPy software for constructing curved membrane systems with biologically inspired shapes. We will also study
protein components of the innate immune system, where we will employ supervised machine learning
approaches to perform classification of simulations from different structural or biochemical states. Using these
approaches will allow us to define new collective variables to compute pathways and energetics of molecular
recognition and activation. For all the proposed studies we will employ advanced multiscale modeling methods
and have existing or identified new experimental collaborators with mutual interest in these systems and
questions, to partner with in these investigations."
10799618,"The proposed project leverages our longstanding partnership with the Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH)
Foundation, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization, to refine and test two promising approaches to
implement cascade screening in individuals with FH. Despite evidence-based guidelines for FH diagnosis and
treatment, over 1 million Americans with this inherited condition remain undiagnosed, and substantial disparities
exist with regard to racial/ethnic minorities (Black and African American people, Asian people) and gender
(women). Cascade screening is an evidence-based practice of contacting and screening first-degree biological
relatives of FH probands and improves timely FH diagnosis and reduces morbidity cost-effectively. Cascade
screening programs have been successful in other countries where health systems play a key role in notification
of relatives, but major implementation challenges limit uptake in the U.S. Pilot projects have identified barriers
including regulatory constraints limiting health system outreach and difficulty contacting family members outside
a given health system. In the U.S., cascade screening must involve the proband given regulatory constraints.
Applying advances in behavioral economics has great potential to improve implementation of cascade screening
via proband-mediated strategies. Led by MPIs with expertise in implementation science (Beidas), behavioral
economics (Volpp), and FH (Rader), we will co-design, pilot, and test two patient-facing implementation
strategies to increase reach of cascade screening with 300 probands within Penn Medicine. Our randomized
controlled trial will test (a) a health system-mediated strategy using automated text messages, (b) a FH
Foundation-mediated strategy using a navigator, and (c) the “usual care” approach to cascade screening. Both
active strategies will be informed by behavioral economics. In the R61 phase, we will co-design health system-
and FH Foundation-mediated implementation strategies using behavioral economics in partnership with the FH
Foundation and key stakeholders from diverse backgrounds (Aim 1) and then pilot our strategies with 20 FH
probands to ascertain feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness (Aim 2). In the R33 phase, we will conduct
a 3-arm hybrid Type 3 effectiveness-implementation RCT, and compare the effect of health system-mediated,
FH Foundation-mediated, and usual care approaches on reach (proportion of probands who have at least one
family member who completes screening), number of family members screened, number of family members
diagnosed with FH, and proband LDL-C levels (Aim 1). We will use mixed methods to identify implementation
strategy mechanisms focusing on health equity by oversampling populations that experience disparities (Aim 2).
By testing sustainable and scalable implementation approaches, our study results will be poised to guide future
wide-scale implementation of cascade screening for FH and other genetic conditions within and outside large
health systems while also answering important questions related to equitable implementation. Successful
strategies can be taken to scale nationally to save lives, in keeping with NHLBI Strategic Objective 6."
10796006,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is a deadly disease with no effective therapy and is associated with one of the worst 5-year
survival rates of all human cancers. Current treatments, which include aggressive surgical care, radiotherapy,
and chemotherapy, are ineffective in part because of the highly adaptable nature of GBM, which facilitates
therapy evasion and a persistent evolution of disease. Recent work has revealed the crucial role of the tumor
microenvironment (TME) in regulating tumor cell plasticity, leading to efforts to create targeted TME-dependent
treatments to combat GBM progression. However, due to the complex nature of the TME and a limited
understanding of the relevant promoters of disease embedded within this milieu, progress in identifying promising
therapeutic targets remains challenging. Within in the TME, biophysical cues including matrix stiffness and
composition, have emerged as significant regulators of GBM cell aggressiveness. Focused investigations on the
biophysical mechanisms regulating GBM cell aggressiveness represent a novel approach to develop effective
GBM TME targeting therapies. The emergence of biophysical alterations in the TME remains poorly understood
with the process of TME tissue remodeling being an underappreciated aspect of GBM progression. Current
investigations indicate that alterations in hyaluronic acid (HA) secretion and digestion may affect tumor
progression through two major processes: 1) shape the biophysical characteristics of the evolving TME, and 2)
induce mesenchymal shifts that leads to increased dysregulations in ECM secretion, increased invasiveness,
and increased proliferation. This proposal seeks to clarify the contributions and mechanisms of ECM remodeling
by quantifying ECM alterations in tumor core and rim and by dissecting the mechanotransductive mechanisms
underlying HA-dependent tumorigenic control. To do this we will test the following hypotheses: 1) Core ECM
remodeling leads to elevated HA content that increases tissue stiffening due to increased HAS2 and HYAL2
activity in mesenchymal tumor regions, 2) Increased mechanical stiffness and HA presentation will synergistically
promote mesenchymal transitions that will lead to increased HASes and decreased HYALs, leading to
accumulation of HA with varying molecular weights and subsequent biophysical alterations, and 3) Increased
HA stiffness will increase CD44 mechanotransduction through CD44 clustering and ERM activity, leading to
upregulated pro-mesenchymal signaling via STAT3-NF-ΚB and LOX-Twist1 and LMW HA secretion. The
proposed studies will be the first to systematically dissect the ECM components of various patient matched
regions of GBM tumors and study their contributions to biophysical characteristics, mesenchymal transitions,
and HA-CD44 mechanotransduction."

Recent studies show that whole genome duplication (WGD) is a frequent event in cancer evolution that promotes
chromosomal instability and aneuploidy. WGD tumors have worse prognosis, elevated drug resistance, and
increased metastatic potential when compared with near-diploid counterparts. However, the mechanisms driving
WGD during cancer evolution remain unclear. This is because the events that lead to WGD occur
asynchronously and at low frequency, making them difficult to capture using traditional approaches such as fixed
endpoint approaches.
My lab has pioneered genetically encoded biosensors and image analysis techniques to biochemically
characterize thousands of individual cells for multiple days as they go through normal or aberrant cell cycles.
Using these approaches, we have found that WGD occurs in response to common stress conditions such as
osmotic stress, DNA damage, and ribosome collisions. This process involves two steps: first cells go from G2 to
G0 without entering into mitosis (i.e. mitotic bypass). Second, some cells escape cell cycle arrest and enter S-
phase, thereby re-duplicating their genome. Furthermore, our data show that DNA damage caused by commonly
used chemotherapeutics promotes WGD in cancer cells raising questions about the role of chemotherapy-
induced WGD in acquired drug resistance. This is particularly important in metastatic Triple Negative Breast
Cancer (mTNBC), for which DNA damaging agents are still a mainstream treatment, and the development of
resistance continues to be a devastating health care problem (median survival rate <18 months).
Here I propose to use our live single-cell approaches to characterize the causes and consequences of WGD in
cancer progression and acquired drug resistance. In Aim 1, we will combine live cell imaging and single-cell
sequencing to uncover how physiological stresses trigger mitotic bypass and WGD in non-transformed cells. In
Aim2, we will study the mechanisms of chemotherapy-induced WGD in cancer cells. In Aim 3, we will use human
breast cancer organoids and patient derived xenografts to define the role of chemotherapy-induced WGD in
acquired drug resistance. Overall, our work will pave the way toward characterizing cell-cycle dynamics in cancer
cells to identify unique vulnerabilities that target the aberrant cell cycles that drive tumorigenesis."

The University of Iowa Regional Coordinating Stroke Center (UIRCC) is ideally positioned to develop, promote, and efficiently conduct high-quality, multi-site clinical trials on stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery, in line with the overarching goal of the NIH StrokeNet. The University of Iowa (UI) is the only academic medical institution and comprehensive stroke center in the state. The UI has led and participated in landmark clinical trials in cerebrovascular disease for over 50 years such as the Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) study, the NIH Stroke Scale, and the TOAST classification of stroke subtype. Over the past 10 years, the UI has served as the UIRCC, bringing together our tradition of multidisciplinary, cutting-edge, cerebrovascular research. We demonstrated our ability to recruit patients by becoming the top enroller in the first StrokeNet trial, DEFUSE-3, and attracting a diverse patient population from the Upper Midwest—a region that experiences unique geographic barriers for enrollment. The UIRCC is committed to mitigating this unacceptable disparity. We are committed to holistically expanding stroke care by increasing the number of stroke interventions that effectively improve patient outcomes, and by expanding the number of patients who can benefit from such interventions. We have a strong commitment to remain a productive member of StrokeNet. Our first aim is to further advance the UIRCC as an efficient and adaptive infrastructure to recruit patients from the Upper Midwest. The restructured UIRCC comprises eight trial-ready geographically linked hospitals that will efficiently conduct critical trials and provide access to patients living in 119 counties from seven states, 56% of whom reside in rural zip codes and traditionally have been excluded from trials due to geographic barriers. It also includes a significant underserved Native American population. Our second aim is to continue to develop innovative interventions to expand stroke care. We plan to reproduce our uric acid success story, the first cryoprotectant to succeed through the NIH Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN). Our group will now be leading the testing of uric acid through the new StrokeNet Thrombectomy Endovascular Platform (STEP). We will continue to build on our multidisciplinary research infrastructure, a diverse group of investigators and trainees. This includes the UI SPAN translational team, as well as clinical researchers and industry partners. This infrastructure will continue to leverage dedicated UI pilot funds to ignite the development of interventions, with an emphasis on those that are simple and therefore widely applicable to a geographically diverse groups of patients."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development application (K23) will provide protected time for
Dr. Frank Schwebel to strengthen his trajectory as independent researcher at the University of New Mexico,
Center on Alcohol, Substance use, And Addictions (UNM-CASAA). His goal is to develop expertise in
mindfulness-based interventions, advanced quantitative methods, and interactive, personalized mHealth
interventions to improve medication adherence and treatment outcomes among individuals struggling with
opioid use disorder (OUD) and other substance use disorders. In order to develop expertise in these areas, the
candidate proposes an innovative, mentored research study using text messages to deliver medication
adherence reminders and mindfulness-based intervention content for individuals taking medications for opioid
use disorder (MOUD). OUD and opioid overdose have increased significantly over the past 20 years and are
considered an epidemic. MOUD has proven to be an effective treatment option, however, medication
adherence is a significant problem with most dropout occurring within one month of MOUD initiation.
Mindfulness-based interventions show promise in helping decrease opioid use. This study builds on existing
literature suggesting the effectiveness of medication reminders and supplements it by focusing on factors that
might help decrease risk of opioid use (e.g., mindfulness, self-efficacy, craving, withdrawal symptoms)
(consistent with NIDA FY 2021-2025 Strategic Plan Outline Goal 2). By conducting a microrandomized trial
(MRT), the study takes an innovative approach to identify effective mindfulness-based intervention content and
is a necessary step in creating a cutting-edge, just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) (consistent with NIDA
Strategic Plan Action 2.1). This mentored study will offer the necessary training to help the candidate develop
expertise to establish his own independent mHealth intervention program of research that specializes in using
mindfulness-based interventions to treat OUD. With the guidance of his mentorship team, Dr. Schwebel’s
training plan and mentored study are integrated and selected to promote the development of a comprehensive
skillset in the following areas: 1) mindfulness-based interventions for OUD (Dr. Witkiewitz [UNM]), 2)
integration of pharmacological and psychological treatments (Drs. Witkiewitz [UNM], Tofighi [NYU]), 3)
advanced mHealth approaches and user-centered design (Drs. Pearson [UNM], Murphy [Harvard], Suffoletto
[Stanford]), 4) advanced quantitative methods (Drs. Witkiewitz [UNM], Pearson [UNM], Murphy [Harvard]), and
5) professional development, dissemination, grantsmanship, and ethics (Drs. Witkiewitz [UNM], Pearson
[UNM], Murphy [Harvard], Suffoletto [Stanford], Tofighi [NYU]). In addition to training at CASAA, Dr. Schwebel
will visit Dr. Murphy’s lab at Harvard University and complete trainings at a variety of institutes across the
country (e.g., mHealth Training Institute, Penn State Methodology Center). Through this training, Dr. Schwebel
will be prepared to develop an independent research program."
10808940,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Elucidating the mechanism and function of neural encodings and circuit dynamics has been a major challenge
in neuroscience and behavioral analyses. However, quantitative behavior analysis has dramatically accelerated
and improved with the implementation and application of new machine learning methods, including new deep
learning-based methods to track animals at high temporal and spatial resolution. This technology has broad
current and potential application that will impact a breadth of fields that have direct relevance and impact on
studies of human health and disease, including the fields of neuroscience, behavior, genetics, psychiatry, and
biomedicine. However, several roadblocks limit the widespread adoption of these tools and analyses. First, many
tracking and behavior analysis packages require a high level of computational expertise and are thus limited in
application to expert labs. Second, with high-resolution data streams, quantitating behavior requires new
statistical tools and proper modeling of data. Since the application of machine learning to behavioral analyses is
an emerging and key methodology, we recognize an unmet need for investigators in a variety of relevant fields
to learn the fundamentals of its rigorous use. Thus, to train a new generation of interdisciplinary researchers at
the interface of neuroscience, machine learning, and behavior, we propose to establish an annual 4-day
workshop that brings together experts in quantitative behavior, computer vision, and experimental design
to provide a practical introduction to the field of quantitative neuroethology and behavior: we propose the
unique and timely interdisciplinary course The Short Course on the Application of Machine Learning for
Automated Quantification of Behavior at the Jackson Laboratory (JAX). This Short Course will provide attendees
(in-person and virtually) with; information on the state-of-the-art of machine learning based behavior quantitation,
the fundamentals of behavior quantitation, hands-on workshops and data analysis, a forum for student-teacher
interaction for networking, and training at the leading edge of computational ethology. Students will emerge from
the course with the ability to: 1) design a high quality, adequately powered behavior experiment; 2) select and
install a suitable platform for high-resolution analysis of animal behavior; 3) deploy a behavior data analysis
strategy, including collecting new training datasets, training analysis software, and validating performance on
held-out data; and 4) run workflows/pipelines that are necessary to analyze their data following extraction. To
achieve this, we propose: Aim 1. To develop and deliver a 4-day workshop to train scientists on application of
machine learning to animal behavior quantitation. Aim 2. To create an environment that will expand the field of
quantitative behavior analysis by fostering idea generation, discussion, and collaboration to yield new
discoveries, broader applications, and advance technology development. Aim 3. Foster the recruitment and
development of diverse junior investigators in neuroscience, behavioral genetics, and quantitative analysis of
animal behavior."
10811024,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) remains a major pathogen worldwide causing lifelong latent
infections in humans. It is responsible for significant disease, ranging from cold sores and
genital infections to blindness and fatal encephalitis. Herpesviral entry is a complex process
involving multiple viral and cellular factors. The long-term goal of this project is to understand
the molecular mechanisms that govern HSV entry into host cells. HSV particles are enveloped
in a host cell-derived lipid bilayer membrane. To accomplish entry, viruses must surmount the
barrier posed by the host membrane. Thus, the HSV entry process is intimately associated with
membrane interactions. The roles of lipid components of virus and cell membranes in HSV entry
are greatly understudied relative to membrane-associated proteins. Sphingomyelin (SM) is the
most common sphingolipid component of biological membranes and is a signature constituent
of lipid rafts. The specific role of SM in herpesviral entry is not well-understood. Based on our
published and preliminary data, two complementary specific aims are proposed. A battery of
assays will be employed to assess the importance of SM for specific steps in the entry process
including cell attachment, endocytic uptake, intracellular vesicular transport, and membrane
fusion. In Specific Aim # 1, we will elucidate the function of HSV envelope sphingomyelin in viral
entry. Experiments in Specific Aim #2 follow from preliminary data indicating the selective
importance of host cell SM in HSV entry by an endocytosis pathway. The precise step(s) in the
entry cascade that require cellular SM will be defined. A combination of molecular, biochemical,
and cell biological approaches will be used to fill key gaps in our understanding of HSV entry."

It is imperative to understand the underlying sources of the large health disparities among individuals from
different racial and ethnic groups living in the United States (US). Complex relationships between genetics and
social factors influence health outcomes. Approximately 33% of people in the US belong to an ethnic minority
group and ~12.5% live below the federal poverty line. Historical and recent mixing of Europeans, Native
Americans, Africans and Asians resulted in the US population having a relatively large number of admixed
individuals who carry ancestry from outside their self-identified race. The All of Us (AoU) Program and the Million
Veterans Program (MVP) include genetic, health and socioeconomic information on all participants, and
therefore provide an opportunity to identify factors contributing to health disparities. However, the AoU program
and MVP require their data to stay within local hosting sites, therefore conducting joint analyses on these cohorts
requires the development of algorithms that enable privacy-protecting distributed computing (i.e., without
revealing individual-level data). There are three important gaps in understanding genetic determinants of health:
1) most studies have been dominated by European individuals, and while they control for global ancestry, there
is no attempt to model the patchwork of local ancestry characteristic of admixed individuals; 2) GWAS are
primarily conducted using SNPs, while important sources of ancestry-specific genetic variation (tandem repeats
(TRs) and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) interval) are not assayed; and 3) most GWAS do not
adjust for socioeconomic factors. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) has
published a list of medically actionable cancer and cardiovascular genes recommended for return of incidental
findings of pathogenic variants to reduce morbidity and mortality, but having minorities excluded from healthcare
follow up due to common barriers (e.g., language and access) makes it difficult to distinguish between the genetic
and socioeconomic factors that contribute to disparate health outcomes. The goal of the CAST (Center for
Admixture Science and Technology) program is to improve the clinical utility of genetic information for all
populations living in the US. In Aim 1, we will develop and apply multivariate models of disease risk prediction
that incorporate local ancestry, complex variants (TRs and HLA types). In Aim 2, we will conduct scalable
distributed computing using data from millions of individuals across the AoU and MVP compute enclaves. In Aim
3, we will develop new approaches to characterize phenotypes using electronic health records and surveys from
AoU and MVP, assess the impact of including social determinants of health in our models, and prospectively
evaluate them with new AoU and MVP participants. To achieve these goals, we assembled a highly
interdisciplinary group of researchers with expertise in Genetics, Genome Biology, Data Sharing Policy and
Technology, Health Disparities, Phenotyping, and Statistics."
10817787,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite ongoing efforts to diversify malaria control interventions with new
technologies such as the use of transgenic mosquitoes to suppress or replace
wild vector populations, insecticides remain the cornerstone of strategies aimed
at reducing the global burden of this disease. In sub-Saharan Africa in particular,
the massive deployment of long-lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual
spraying has contributed to a significant reduction in malaria incidence in just two
decades. For this reason, the development of insecticide resistance currently
observed among vector populations is regarded as a very serious thread that can
quickly undermine recent gains in malaria control. To preserve the effectiveness
of insecticides used for malaria vector control, target interventions informed by
sufficient knowledge of the susceptibility profile of local populations are more
than crucial. Our project aims to study the development of resistance to
clothianidin, a new insecticide recently approved for indoor residual spraying. To
achieve our goal, we will capitalize on an international collaboration between
Liverpool School of Topical Medicine in the UK, Centre for Research in Infectious
Diseases in Cameroon as well as notional and international partners directly
involved in the fight against malaria in Cameroon. This collaboration will foster
capacity building and transfer of technologies in order to promote the use state-
of-the-art genomic and functional genomic tools to address the underpinnings of
insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in endemic countries. The specific aims
of our project are: 1) to monitor the susceptibility of An. gambiae to clothianidin in
Cameroon, 2) to evaluate the development and establishment of resistance in
clothianidin-selected populations of An. gambiae, and 3) to determine the genetic
loci underlying resistance to clothianidin.

OVERALL
The overall objective of the proposed UCSD Learning Health Systems (LHS) Center is to provide didactic and
experiential training in learning health systems science to clinicians and other scientists from diverse
backgrounds. The three cores of the Center – Administrative Core, Research and Education Core, and
Research and Data Analysis Core – will operate as inter-dependent parts of the Center infrastructure to
support the professional development of scientists to conduct research that accelerates progress towards an
integrated learning health system. By design, the Center’s LHS infrastructure and workflow present holistic
opportunities for LHS Scientists to interact with their sponsors, with their cohort, and other member of the LHS
community. A LHS research project funded in the Center will also provide LHS Scientists a learning opportunity
encompassing the full circle of developing, executing, managing, and reporting a research project as an
embedded scientist. The proposed LHS Center will enhance diversity of both the LHS Scientists as well as
patients who will benefit from LHS interventions in a minimum of three safety net health systems, UCSD and
two federally qualified health centers, El Centro Regional Medical Center (ECRMC) and Family Health Centers
of San Diego (FHCSD), that serve disproportionally underserved and minoritized populations. Multi-channel
outreach efforts will cover underrepresented minority faculty and scientists both within and outside of the
UCSD health sciences programs. Healthcare professionals including nurses and social scientists such as
economists and sociologists are also eligible. The proposed Center has assembled faculty members
representing multiple disciplines, gender, race, and age. Many of them specialize in health equity and are
national leaders in reducing racial disparities in access to health services. All of them are engaged in research
efforts that are well aligned with AHRQ/PCORI’s priorities. Their projects offer LHS Scientists experiential
education opportunities that will be highly beneficial in preparation for their own research project. The proposed
Center aims to (1) mentor and train clinicians and other scientists in competencies of learning health systems,
organizational transformation, hypothesis generation and testing, data management and analysis, patient and
stakeholder engagement, and how to apply research insights to address health system priorities in real world
practice workflow; (2) to support and train LHS Scientists in sophisticated methods of deriving study-relevant
structured and unstructured data from the electronic health record system and gain competencies in mixed
methods research; and (3) to facilitate bidirectional asset-based community development opportunities for
implementation of learning health systems pragmatic research in resource constrained care environments with
diverse and underserved populations and in academic health systems with a broad range of deep expertise."
10817829,"PBTC Project Summary/Abstract
The primary goal of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) is to rapidly and effectively
contribute to the understanding and cure of pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors
through innovative, multidisciplinary and multi-institutional prospective clinical trials. PBTC clinical
trial development is not only based upon known prognostic factors but also upon an evolving
understanding of pediatric brain tumor biology. The PBTC will continue to utilize innovative study
designs and analyses based on state-of-the-art statistical science. Novel clinical trials will
incorporate relevant correlative pharmacology, biology, neuroimaging, immunologic and
genomics studies in an effort to define and integrate these modalities into a better understanding
of pediatric CNS tumors. These goals will be accomplished through a close and continued
partnership with the member institutions' basic and translational scientists as well as the clinical
trial experts. In addition, the PBTC welcomes partnerships with investigators outside the
consortium providing scientific, laboratory and regulatory support for innovative and high priority
clinical trials. The PBTC will continue to maintain and grow its relationship with the National
Cancer Institute (NCI) and its large network of adult and pediatric groups as well as with
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. One of the most important goals of the PBTC is to
successfully complete focused phase I and II clinical trials of novel agents and treatment
approaches that can be then be translated into large prospective phase II and III studies overseen
by the Children's Oncology Group (COG). The overarching long-term goal is to improve survival
outcome and quality of life for children with CNS tumor diagnoses that so often lead to high
morbidity and mortality such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, high-grade gliomas, infant
embryonal tumors, refractory medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and low-grade gliomas. To this
end, the PBTC will continue to focus upon introducing novel molecularly-targeted agents via
innovative trials to assess the presence of the target in tumor and surrogate tissue, evaluate the
ability of the agent to down-regulate its signaling target and better correlate pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic endpoints with toxicities and clinical responses. The PBTC will also continue
to explore therapeutic opportunities for pediatric brain tumors through immunotherapeutic
interventions as well as via local delivery of treatments. By focusing on the most common solid
tumor in children which also accounts for the highest number of cancer-related deaths in
pediatrics, the PBTC will continue to support the NCI's mission of helping all people live longer,
healthier lives through its contributions to cancer research and identification of better treatments."

Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections result in significant morbidity and mortality in people
suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). A key feature of these infections is that they involve biofilm
communities. The expression of several key biofilm matrix components (e.g. the Pel,Psl
exopolysaccharides and the matrix adhesin CdrA) are known to be initiated upon interaction
with a surface. There are two known surface sensing systems in P. aeruginosa, Wsp and Pil-
Chp, that both act by stimulating production of the intracellular signal c-di-GMP. The overall
goals of this application are to investigate the Wsp surface sensing system, the signals it
responds to, how it integrates surface sensing with the other surface sensing system Pil-Chp
during the early stages of biofilm aggregate assembly. We will also examine the pathogenic
fitness advantages of different surface sensing genotypes in murine models of infection and in
vitro cellular immunological assays. This proposal will address gaps in our knowledge as to how
surface sensing works and its contribution to pathogenesis. Future therapeutic strategies
(particularly ones directed towards biofilm communities) will benefit from such knowledge."

ABSTRACT
 The Pilot Project Program is arguably the ‘heart’ of the Harvard Chan-NIEHS Center. It encourages
innovation and creativity, and provides a pathway for outstanding new investigators to enter environmental
health research. It provides critical support for investigators to develop preliminary data that can be used for
research projects that result in manuscripts and larger grant awards. Its emphasis on innovative and creative
approaches has resulted in numerous career development and research project grants from both NIH and
other funding sources.
 Pilot Project applications are solicited broadly from the Harvard academic community twice a year.
Each application is reviewed for scientific merit by three experts (at least two outside the Center). The most
sound applications are then ranked programmatically. All applicants are notified of funding decisions and given
feedback within 6 weeks. Separately, investigators who need smaller amounts of funding for specific laboratory
analyses may apply for Facility Access Funds (Mini-Pilots) with review and a decision within two days.
 The Center Pilot Program has been successful in attracting applications from across the spectrum of
departments and disciplines in the Harvard Longwood Medical Area and the Harvard academic community. In
the last five years of the Harvard Chan-NIEHS Center, 52 pilot grant awards have resulted in 46 peer-reviewed
publications and 14 funded new NIEHS grant awards.
 The Pilot Project program is a highly leveraged investment that facilitates the growth of our Center’s
research scope and fosters young investigators’ careers. It also provides the opportunity to work with the local
community on research projects. Pilot project funds have proven to be an extremely productive, high yield
investment that leads our Center’s research into important new areas of study."
10818451,"1. ENVIRONMENTAL BIOMARKERS CORE (EBC): ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Environmental Biomarkers Core (EBC) is to provide bioanalytical services in support of
ChicAgo Center for Health and EnvironmenT (CACHET) members conducting environmental health research at
the University of Chicago (UofC) and University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). By providing the necessary
experimental expertise to assess a wide range of environmental biomarkers, the EBC directly contributes to
CACHET’s mission to mitigate environmental health inequities within our communities. Toward that end, the
EBC consists of two complimentary Sub-Cores: 1) a mass spectrometry-based Environmental Exposures Sub-
Core that is P30-specific in services and resources available to members, and 2) a Biomarkers of Exposure
Effects and Susceptibility Sub-Core that leverages existing institutional resources at UofC and UIC and
streamlines services to members. The P30-specific Environmental Exposures Sub-Core at UIC will use mass
spectrometry to assess toxic chemicals, heavy metals and metalloids, herbicides, pesticides, perfluoroalkyl
substances, steroids and DNA oxidation products, among others, in both biological and environmental samples.
New assays for environmental compounds will be developed and validated as needed by CACHET investigators.
The Biomarkers of Exposure Effects and Susceptibility Sub-Core will leverage established institutional strengths
in microbiome sequencing, metabolomics, proteomics, genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics on the two
campuses. Further, bioinformatics support for all CACHET PI-initiated research projects and Facility Core
activities will be provided from established institutional cores at both partner institutions. For all of these services,
CACHET members will enjoy priority access and subsidized rates for environmental health research projects
provided by Center resources and leveraging institutional cost-sharing of intellectual expertise, management
platforms and heavy investments in high-end instrumentation. These combined resources help address the EBC
mission to provide qualitative and quantitative data regarding biomarkers of exposure, disease and therapeutic
responses as well as levels of environmental contaminants in human subjects, model systems and
environmental samples at subsidized rates and with priority access to Center members."
10818452,"1. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE (CEC): ABSTRACT
The Mission of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) of the ChicAgo Center for Health and EnvironmenT
(CACHET) is to engage local Chicago communities (community residents and key stakeholders) in
neighborhoods with known and potential environmental sources, pollutants, exposures or health risk in an
iterative process to identify priority environmental hazards of concern within their neighborhoods and align these
concerns with CACHET research activities and promote long-term partnership. Engagement at the neighborhood
level in Chicago is particularly important given the known relationship between environmental hazard exposure
and the history of racial/ethnic segregation in the City which results in environmental injustice experienced by
residents on the South and West sides of the city. Identification of the environmental hazards of concern that
may drive these health injustices, as well as development of research, advocacy, and implementation strategies
to address these matters, involves building and maintaining collaborations with local community groups that are
best positioned to know these hazards. To accomplish this, the CACHET’s CEC builds on solid relationships
established during the initial round of funding, with community groups in Southeast (SE) Chicago (community of
Hegewisch, East Side, South Deering, South Chicago, and Bush and Jeffrey Manor neighborhoods) historically
one of the largest steel manufacturing areas of the world; and, community organizations serving Little Village,
the home of the former Crawford and Fisk coal-powered power plant. These areas are two of the most polluted
areas in the country with strong histories of community organizing and advocacy. We will also build on newer
relationships in Altgeld Gardens (the home of Hazel Johnson, the Mother of the environmental justice movement
and founder of People for Community Recovery in 1982); and the 19th Ward, areas with various environmental
challenges, social and economic hardship, and racially/ethnically mixed populations. To enhance the impact of
the CEC moving into the next round of funding, the CEC will (1) pivot and reorganize CEC co-leadership to
maximize engagement; (2) invest in additional engagement mechanisms; (3) prioritize the production of
community-engaged research (CEnR) outcomes; and (4) enhance bi-directional communication across
CACHET research cores and institutions. The CACHET CEC will reside in the Collaboratory for Health Justice
in the School of Public Health at University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). This integration will allow us to benefit from
the engagement expertise of the Collaboratory while continuing to leverage the scientific expertise and strong
community partnerships of our two large institutions—the University of Chicago (UofC) and UIC—with a long
history of collaboration and commitment to decreasing environmental exposures and improving health equity in
communities predominately populated by Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC) localized to the South
and West sides of the City."
10818454,"1. PILOT PROJECT PROGRAM: ABSTRACT
The ChicAgo Center for Health and EnvironmenT (CACHET) Pilot Project Program is designed to fund new
directions in environmental health sciences (EHS) research and provide a primary mechanism for developing
the careers of CACHET members. The Pilot Project Program is critical to promoting the success of CACHET
investigators and the development of future CACHET resources in EHS research. Indeed, in the current
abbreviated funding cycle, this program funded 28 pilot awards totaling $639,000 in research dollars to Center
members. To date, these awards have directly led to five NIH-funded R01 and one K08 grants totaling
$11,329,383, while five submitted grants are pending and four were submitted but not funded. Pilot projects
awarded through this program explore new EHS research areas, build research collaborations and teams (within
each institution, between the two institutions and externally), support the next generation of EHS researchers
and accelerate external grant support of CACHET members. Proposals that consider data collected by the
Community Engagement Core (CEC) as well as proposals that actively collaborate with CEC community
participants are encouraged. This focus enables CACHET to directly address the environmental research needs
of the community and, in so doing, undertake research aimed at mitigating racial and ethnic health disparities as
a function of adverse environmental factors. Innovative and high-risk/high-reward studies are also encouraged.
The Pilot Project Program has four primary award types: Young Investigator Award, Idea Award, Focused
Research Award and Inter-Institutional Award; each addresses specific needs for building and supporting a
strong EHS research community in Chicago. Proposals are reviewed for scientific merit, feasibility, community-
relevance, and potential to lead to external grants in EHS research from NIEHS and other funding agencies.
Funds awarded by the program are not only essential for cultivating the careers of junior investigators by
enhancing their success in obtaining grants and publications, but also for attracting established investigators
from other disciplines into the EHS research field and fostering new collaborations. We are confident that in the
next five years, the Pilot Project Program will result in a substantial increase in NIEHS funding for CACHET
investigators, will noticeably expand EHS research capacity in Chicago, fostering the next generation of EHS
researchers and will meaningfully impact the local community."

resources and expertise for modeling of airborne contaminants and exposure assessment; Aim 2) support
EHSRC Thematic Areas, pilot studies, CEC activities, and mentored Associate Members; Aim 3) facilitate
multidisciplinary research among EHSRC investigators; Aim 4) provide expertise, as well as facilitate
interaction, in the continuum of exposure assessment and health-based investigation; and Aim 5) facilitate
pre-doctoral, post-doctoral and Associate Member training in modeling and exposure assessment methods.
The ESF is supported by a team of investigators with longstanding expertise in the wide-ranging aspects of its
Aims, including expertise in environmental pollutant sampling, industrial hygiene practices, health physics, air
dispersion modeling, computational fluid dynamics modeling, and chemical analytical methods related to all
routes of exposure. The ESF provides a critical role within the EHSRC by aiding investigators at all levels and
pilot grant recipients to properly identify, quantify and model environmental contaminants, and quantify risk.
The ESF strives to develop and maintain instrumentation and modeling capabilities, which help investigators
link environmental contaminants with health outcomes. The ESF is therefore of fundamental importance to
EHSRC investigators as they seek to understand the complicated linkages between human health and the
exposome. The ESF achieves its goals through its collection of state-of-the-art instruments and laboratories.
Combined, they include a wide variety of instruments used to sample gases, vapors, and aerosols in addition
to those capable of analyzing various chemical compounds in complex matrices, including water, food, air,
blood, and tissue samples. ESF modeling capabilities include those used to determine the spatial distribution
of air pollutants and the deposition of particles in the human lung. ESF leadership faculty and staff provide
consultation and training to EHSRC investigators planning research projects involving the assessment of
environmental exposures on human health. The ESF is a unique facility on the University of Iowa campus that
has strong associations with its central facilities. Together with these facilities and its collection of instruments
and related support, the ESF allows EHSRC investigators to prepare cost-effective budgets when soliciting
extramural funds for their research."

The overarching goal of the Pulmonary Toxicology Facility (PTF) is to provide the facilities and expertise for
investigators to enhance the productivity and quality of their pulmonary toxicology research and to assist them
in exploring new investigative areas in asthma, pulmonary biology, inhalation toxicology, and aerosol science.
Investigators are also supported with expertise and assays to evaluate exposures to rural airborne toxicants,
asthma triggers, and microorganism-associated molecular patterns such as bacterial endotoxin and fungal
glucans in environmental epidemiology studies. The PTF is an extremely productive and highly interactive facility
that plays an indispensable role in advancing rural environmental health and the Thematic Areas, Pilot Grant
Program, and Career Enhancement Program of the EHSRC. Through rigorous and transformative research, the
PTF expands the body of knowledge on inhaled toxicants applying innovative exposure systems and
methodology. The PTF conducts studies to elucidate adverse outcome pathways for inhaled environmentally-
relevant toxicants and multipollutant mixtures. The PTF has the equipment and staff expertise to provide
investigators with validated methods and authenticated biological reagents for addressing novel hypotheses
regarding pulmonary exposures, lung biology, and biological response profiles. The PTF provides services free
of charge to recipients of EHSRC pilot grants and Associate Members receiving salary support from the Career
Enhancement Program. Other EHSRC Members, NIEHS intramural researchers, and members of NIEHS-
funded centers at other institutions receive discounted rates. The institutional commitment to the facility is
spectacular, with a recent $4.3 M facility renovation plus $500,000 for new instrumentation. In the current cycle,
the PTF has served 78 investigators on 87 projects including in vitro and in vivo toxicology studies and
environmental epidemiology cohort studies. Six specific aims will be addressed in the proposed scope of work:
Aim 1) Provide expertise and facilities for the use of animal models to elucidate adverse outcome pathways of
xenobiotics or to test novel inhalation therapies; Aim 2) Design and perform inhalation exposure studies to groups
of laboratory animals under rigidly controlled exposure conditions; Aim 3) Assess biomarkers and sensitive
physiologic endpoints to identify biological response profiles, low-dose functional changes, and susceptibility
factors; Aim 4) Provide high-content in vitro studies using tri-culture lung cells exposed at the air-liquid interface;
Aim 5) Perform exposure assessment of endotoxins, glucans, allergens, and metagenomics of microbial
communities in support of epidemiologic studies of environmental lung diseases; and Aim 6) Facilitate pre-
doctoral, post-doctoral and EHSRC member training. The vast array of services provided by the PTF are crucial
to meeting EHSRC goals and advancing NIEHS priorities as articulated in their strategic plan."
10818466,"PROJECT SUMMARY - COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE (CEC)
Rural residents experience numerous health disparities and generally have poorer health than their urban
counterparts. In our Midwestern region, residents across the rural-urban continuum are exposed to
environmental hazards that primarily result from agricultural production, including agrochemicals and pesticides,
depleted water quality, bioaerosols, organic dust and allergens, and antibiotic-resistant pathogens from the
livestock industry. Given the complex socio-political structures that facilitate large-scale agricultural production,
there is a critical need for the EHSRC to engage in robust and participatory community engagement that
enhances environmental health knowledge and empowers rural residents to address environmental health
concerns. The overarching goal of the CEC is to address rural health disparities and enhance the community
engagement of EHSRC research through deep collaboration with rural audiences, building center scientists’
skills in community engagement, creating multi-media environmental health resources that respond to audience
needs, and advancing the field of rural environmental health engagement. The Specific Aims of the CEC are to:
Aim 1) Enhance engagement with rural audiences to develop collaborative relationships that result in the co-
production of environmental health resources and knowledge; Aim 2) strengthen relationships between center
members and rural audiences through mentorship and training; Aim 3) improve rural environmental health
literacy through effective research translation and multi-modal communication strategies; and Aim 4) advance
the field of rural environmental health engagement through rigorous social science assessment of community
engagement strategies. To accomplish these Aims, the CEC will build on past successes and engage in new
initiatives to address audience-identified environmental health concerns. We have expanded our Stakeholder
Advisory Board (SAB) to include organizations that represent our audiences (community members,
policymakers, public health professionals, and educators). We are committed to the equal co-production of
resources and knowledge and work with the SAB as full partners. We will continue our successful Science Café
series, connecting EHSRC researchers with community members and enhancing environmental health
knowledge. We have developed a new Community Engagement Fellowship and CEC Pilot Grant supplement to
mentor center members in community engagement. Finally, we will employ social science methods to develop
rural engagement strategies and models that can be implemented nationally. The EHSRC CEC serves a vital role in
the state and the region, engaging Center scientists in multi-directional communication with our audiences. Going
forward, the CEC will continue to expand the number of stakeholders aware of and engaged with the Center while
continuing to disseminate Center research to audiences across the region."
10819656,"ABSTRACT. Retinal neovascular diseases including neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
macular edema and retinal vein occlusion are the most vision-threatening diseases in the working-age population
in the developed world. Therapies targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) delay the development
of neovascularization in some, but not all, patients, implicating additional factor(s) in retinal neovascular
pathogenesis. In addition, the frequent intraocular injection is a significant burden for both patients and
physicians entailing a small risk of endophthalmitis, uveitis, vitreous hemorrhage and other complications. Thus,
there is much needed retinal neovascular disease treatment that can be delivered less frequently and yet provide
the same or better vision than current anti-VEGF therapies.
Phase I has been completed. We have successfully obtained a panel of potent, single domain modular antibodies
(nanobodies) against VEGF and CD147, the latter is a potent angiogenic factor and an inducer of matrix
metalloproteinase synthesis and also reported to have high levels in the vitreous of retinal neovascular disease
patients. The functional activities of VEGF and CD147 antibodies have been characterized in vitro including the
assessment of their anti-angiogenic activities in tube formation assays. Using a 12-mer phage display peptide
library we have isolated three unique peptides that binds to hyaluronan, a major macromolecular component of
the eye’ vitreous. Recombinant VHH antibodies (single variable domain on a heavy chain [VHH] antibodies, also
referred to as nanobodies) fused with hyaluronan-binding peptides shown extended retainment in a 3-D
hyaluronic gel. In addition to anti-VEGF and anti-CD147 nanobodies, we also successfully generated potent
antibodies against three targets related to eye diseases. Phase II will be performed in collaboration with Dr.
Rohrer’s group at Medical University of South Carolina: the anti-neovascularization activity and in-vivo half-life
of selected antibody drug candidates targeting VEGF and CD147 will be characterized, validated in animal
models and humanized pursuing the IND application."
10820051,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with symptoms usually manifesting later
in life in patients over 65 years of age, so called late-onset or sporadic AD. The World Alzheimer’s Report
projects that AD related dementia will rise to 76 million cases by 2030 and 132 million cases by 2050. In the
US alone it is estimated that in 2018, Alzheimer’s and other dementias cost the nation $277 billion. By 2050,
costs could rise as high as $1.1 trillion. Novel therapeutics that prevented or even slowed AD progression
would be of immense economic importance and benefit a huge, and growing, number of patients and their
families. Atux Iskay LLC proposes to develop a novel class of compounds as AD therapeutics that act by
increasing, and normalizing, abnormally suppressed protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity in AD, and
thereby directly target the underlying pathology of the disease. Atux Iskay LLC proposes to develop lead
compounds that bind and allosterically activate PP2A, thereby suppressing tau phosphorylation, amyloidogenic
APP processing and neuroinflammation associated with established disease. The lead compound is orally
bioavailable and partitions into the CNS after oral dose. Prototype compounds are active in cellular models of
tau-phosphorylation and Ab secretion, show neuroprotective effects in ex vivo electrophysiology models of
synaptic plasticity and are active in an in vivo rat model of AD where they ameliorate tau and Ab pathologies
and rescue behavioral and cognitive deficits induced in the disease model. The objectives of the project are
 Aim 1. Synthetic and process chemistry on pyran sulfonamide lead. A. Scale-up and resolution
(into (+)- and (-)-enantiomers) of lead compound, ATUX-5800, for pilot toxicology and efficacy studies. B.
Synthetic route scouting for GMP process synthesis of resolved ATUX-5800. Aim 2. Pilot safety assessment
on resolved enantiomer of ATUX-5800. A. Rat PK on resolved isomers of ATUX-5800. B. In vitro, off target,
profile on resolved isomers of ATUX-5800. C In vitro safety assessment on (+)-ATUX-5800 or (-)-ATUX-5800.
D. In vivo (rat) pilot toxicology on (+) or (-)-ATUX-5800. Aim 3. In vivo efficacy on (+) or (-)-ATUX-5800 in
5xFAD transgenic mouse model and assessment of neuroinflammation. Aim 4. Structural biology and
back-up medicinal chemistry. A. Novel modifications of ATUX-5800 structural type. B. Medicinal chemistry
to identify development candidate from ATUX-6156 (sulfonyl urea) structural type. C. Structural biology to
obtain PP2A (A and AC) with bound lead activators ((+) and (-)-ATUX-5800) and back-ups.
 Successful completion of the Phase 2 SBIR Aims will position a lead compound for GMP synthesis and
IND enabling GLP toxicology. The overall objective are new, first in class, disease modifying AD therapeutics
that will benefit AD patients and reduce the enormous and growing burden of Alzheimer’s Disease Related
Dementia."

Pathogenic mycobacteria damage the phagosome and interact with the macrophage cytoplasm. The mycobac-
terial factors that control bacteriolysis in the cytoplasm are unknown. The objective of this proposal is to define
the genes controlling mycobacterial bacteriolysis in the macrophage cytoplasm. The central hypothesis for this
application is that mycobacteria actively control bacteriolysis in the cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, the fol-
lowing specific aims will be tested. The applicant has adapted an established reporter for cytoplasmic bacteriol-
ysis from Listeria monocytogenes for use with Mycobacterium. Under the first aim, the applicant proposes a
targeted approach to define the impact of known virulence factors on mycobacterial bacteriolysis. The objective
of Aim 1 is to define if known virulence pathways protect M. marinum from bacteriolysis. The applicant will test
the working hypothesis that known virulence pathways that modulate the inflammasome protect Mycobacterium
from bacteriolysis in the macrophage cytoplasm. M. marinum strains lacking specific virulence pathways will be
generated and bacteriolysis will be measured during macrophage infection. Under the second aim, the applicant
proposes an unbiased approach to identify genes required for cytoplasmic adaptation of mycobacterial patho-
gens. The objective of Aim 2 is to Identify genes the control mycobacterial bacteriolysis. The applicant will test
working hypothesis that several conserved pathways protect mycobacterial pathogens from bacteriolysis in the
cytoplasm. Two complementary genetic screens to identify molecular pathways controlling mycobacterial bacte-
riolysis in the cytoplasm during macrophage infection. The applicant expects that the successful completion of
Aim 1 will determine if known virulence pathways protect mycobacteria from bacteriolysis. The completion of
Aim 2 is expected to identify new pathways that promote mycobacterial survival in the cytoplasm. Completion of
the proposed aims will contribute an initial understanding of the mechanisms required for preventing mycobac-
terial bacteriolysis in the macrophage cytoplasm, moving the field in a new direction. This contribution will be
significant because it will identify a new molecular mechanism underlying mycobacterial pathogenesis. The ap-
plication is conceptually innovative because it focuses on mycobacterial determinants that protect mycobacteria
from bacteriolysis in the cytoplasm, which represents a shift in focus for the field. The experimental design is
innovative because it applies a novel indirect reporter of cytoplasmic bacteriolysis that has not previously been
used to study mycobacterial species."
10819979,"Project Summary/Abstract
More than three-fifths of Americans with mental health disorders (MHD) have not received treatment in the
prior year. Societally, under-utilization of mental health care has a substantial impact on disability and
contributes to premature mortality through causes such as suicide. The problem of low mental health care use
persists despite progress in increasing the rate of health insurance coverage. A major barrier to mental health
services is cost, even among the majority of Americans who have either employer-sponsored or individual
market commercial health insurance. As such policy interventions to reduce costs of mental health services
among people with commercial insurance might have substantial effects on mental health services use and
potentially quality. In 2021, New Mexico passed SB 317 “No Behavioral Health Cost Sharing,” which prohibited
cost-sharing for mental health services in the commercial insurance plans that the state regulates. This law
was the first of its kind nationally, and represents a stark natural experiment in reducing cost-related barriers to
mental health services. The proposed study will assess the implementation and effects of the SB 317 No
Behavioral Health Cost Sharing law with four specific aims. 1) Characterize the implementation of SB 317 from
the perspective of clinicians and patients in New Mexico who are directly affected by the law, using qualitative
interviews with key stakeholders. 2) Assess the effect of SB317 on MHD services benefit generosity using
insurance documents that summarize plan benefits. 3) Evaluate the effect of SB317 on use of MHD services
using quasi-experimental methods and comprehensive commercial claims data. 4) Evaluate the effect of
SB317 on the quality of MHD services received. Understanding the way that zero cost-sharing affects mental
health services will provide important new evidence to help guide mental health financing decisions to most-
efficiently improve mental health services use."

10819978,"Project Abstract
In this SBIR Phase I project, ASTER Labs will significantly enhance an innovative system able to accurately
detect Activities of Daily Living (ADL) performed by persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
with new capabilities to determine specific compliance or non-compliance during their daily lives. This new
solution addresses a current unmet need to significantly streamline ongoing evaluations of persons’ abilities to
complete these important activities, and will equip care providers with reliable, automated, and on-demand
information to assist with assessing patients’ functional independence and making informed decisions on
interventions and level of care based on disease progression. In 2023, an estimated 6.7 million Americans live
with Alzheimer’s dementia. Nearly a third live alone and are more likely to suffer poorer health outcomes than
those cohabitating. Clinical research shows the importance of ongoing ADL assessment to establish diagnoses
of dementia and its progression. Current and proposed ways to automate this assessment (e.g. cameras,
beacon-based tracking systems) have been limited and criticized based on potential privacy concerns, reduced
accuracy and coverage, and need for significant infrastructure additions. Ubiquitous commercial products
primarily focus on fitness activities versus ADL, and further, inadequately address dementia patients’ unique
sensitivity to non-discreet, unfamiliar wearable devices. ASTER Labs’ work on two related systems leveraging
a discreet electronic shoe insole specifically designed for dementia patient care has identified a strong need to
complement clinical interventions (e.g. compensatory memory techniques, memory notebooks) to help prevent
or delay dementia onset and preserve functional independence. As those with cognitive impairment risk
inaccurate recollection of ADL performed throughout the day, ASTER Labs’ system is able to automatically and
accurately detect and identify ADL. However, an unmet need exists to enhance the ability of dementia care
providers to receive verifiable notifications of ADL compliance, based on whether automatically-detected
activities were performed as expected, and according to specific constraints on frequency of occurrence.
Therefore ASTER Labs’ proposed ActivVerify system will leverage its technology using intelligent processing of
WiFi, GPS, inertial, and audio sensor data from a small hardware suite concealed in a shoe insole and
unnoticeable to the wearer, combined with new data analysis software capabilities that use constraint
scheduling and matching to determine and verify ADL compliance. In Phase I, the prototype system will be
assembled, with feasibility demonstrated by functional evaluation in a focus group study with caregivers,
physicians, and cognitive rehabilitation therapists of patients with dementia. The system’s ADL compliance
accuracy will be determined in timed experiments by ASTER Labs’ engineers wearing the prototype insoles.
Phase I testing will provide the success criteria for the Phase II program, which will include a human study of
the fully-operational system in home and independent living settings to establish the efficacy of this approach."

This F31 proposal details a 3-year research and training plan that will launch the applicant’s career as an independent clinical
investigator focused on mind-body and peer support intervention development to promote whole person health in patients
with critical illnesses and their family members. The overarching scientific goal is to lay the foundation for the development
of a mind-body peer support intervention for caregivers to patients with severe acute brain injury (SABI) by conducting
preliminary quantitative and qualitative work and adapting existing interventions with stakeholder-engaged methods.
Family caregivers to patients with SABI are at risk for chronic emotional distress, yet no tailored, efficacious interventions
exist to promote their mental and physical wellbeing. Prior research suggests that mind-body skills (e.g., mindfulness,
coping) can prevent chronic distress and promote wellbeing in caregivers in line with a biopsychosocial model of health. A
peer-to-peer support model is an ideal approach to deliver mind-body skills to SABI caregivers for 3 key reasons: 1) peer
support interventions capitalize on the value of social support to buffer against stress in caregivers, consistent with the Stress
Buffering Hypothesis; 2) peer support interventions can powerfully spur health behavior change as explained by Dynamic
Social Impact Theory; and 3) peer support interventions are more cost-effective, scalable, and appropriate for lower-resource
settings than clinician-delivered interventions. An understanding of the support needs and perceptions of peer support
among SABI caregivers is needed to inform the adaptation of a tailored mind-body peer support intervention. Informed by
the intervention mapping framework, this study aims to 1) Investigate the association between availability of social support
(Aim 1a) and satisfaction with social support (Aim 1b) and emotional distress over time in SABI caregivers using existing
co-sponsor datasets (quantitative analyses; Aim 1); 2) Explore SABI caregiver perspectives on a mind-body peer support
intervention through individual interviews (qualitative interviews; Aim 2); and 3) Engage SABI caregivers in facilitated
workshop to co-develop the mind-body peer support intervention manual (stakeholder-engaged intervention design; Aim
3). Through these aims, the applicant will receive training in mind-body and peer support interventions, quantitative
methods, advanced qualitative methods, and equity-centered stakeholder engagement methods. The applicant’s training
goals are supported by dedicated sponsors and collaborators with complementary expertise. This F31 will equip the
applicant with the necessary training and preliminary data for future work towards the goal of supporting SABI caregivers,
including a K23 to refine the proposed intervention and evaluate feasibility in an open pilot with exit interviews and
randomized controlled trial. This F31 aligns with NCCIH’s strategic plan, including focus on the whole person and the
integration of complementary and conventional care in real-world settings, and research on health promotion, resilience,
and disease prevention. If successful, the proposed mind-body peer support intervention could be adapted for other
populations of family members in critical care settings, with wide-reaching potential to be implemented in diverse critical
care settings and improve the long-term wellbeing of family members after critical illness."

 Respiratory disease is the third leading cause of death in the industrialized world. Pulmonary fibrosis
(PF) is a progressively debilitating and terminal disease in which the normally pliable tissue of the lung is
gradually replaced with rigid scar tissue. PF is an especially difficult respiratory disease, as there are no
effective treatments and patients die within an average of three to five years of diagnosis. Current models
suggest that alveolar injury and ineffective repair underlie the pathogenesis of PF and other lung diseases.
However, the mechanisms by which injury in the alveolar epithelium contributes to fibrotic disease remain
unclear. Single cell transcriptomics data demonstrate that a transitional state exists between the well
characterized alveolar type 2 (AT2) and type 1 (AT1) epithelial cells. Furthermore, marker analysis of this
transitional state in human PF lungs suggests that accumulation of transitional cells occurs in regions with
dense myofibroblasts in fibrotic lungs. It is unclear what molecular mechanisms regulate the state of alveolar
epithelial cells, but data from our lab has shown that TP53 is transiently upregulated in normal differentiation
of AT2 to AT1 cells. This proposal details approaches to uncover the role of TP53 in regulating alveolar
epithelial cell states, and to determine the impact of an alveolar epithelial transition state on pulmonary
fibrosis. Understanding the mechanisms that drive these transitional states and their potential role in PF
disease pathogenesis offers new avenues for developing novel therapies for fibrotic and other lung diseases."
10819176,"Project Summary:
The Administrative Core of the P50 application on “Center for Alcohol Research in Epigenetics (CARE)” will
coordinate multiple research and pilot projects and the Epigenetics and Behavioral Cores comprising of
multidisciplinary research teams. The goal of the CARE to evaluate ethanol-induced epigenetic mechanisms
(histone modifications and DNA methylation/demethylation) of transcriptomic and epitranscriptomic (RNA
modifications) changes in specific brain circuitries during the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). The
overall hypothesis is that ethanol induces transcriptomic changes due to chromatin remodeling (histone & DNA
chemical modifications) in specific neurocircuitries, and that these drive behavioral phenotypes including anxiety,
depression, motivation, and escalated ethanol intake. To test this hypothesis, we have selected four interrelated
research projects and two pilot projects on epigenetics and epitranscriptomics and set-up two resource cores i.e.,
Epigenetics and Behavioral Cores utilizing a rat model of alcohol dependence and human postmortem brains to
discover integrated and functional facets of the epigenome in AUD. Our approach takes into consideration that
both negative and positive effects of ethanol contribute to the initiation and maintenance of AUD. Research
projects #1, #2, #3 and #4 will evaluate the status of the epigenome and its role in the altered transcriptome in
the ventral tegmental area (VTA), amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex (PFC). We will examine these
in relation to both the euphoric and dysphoric (negative emotional state) aspects of ethanol dependence and
withdrawal. We also propose two pilot projects; one on ethanol-induced epigenetic changes in peripheral cells
in humans and rodents serving as biomarkers of active drinking and abstinence. A second pilot project will
examine the novel area of the epitranscritome in AUD. The Administrative Core will provide administrative
leadership, overall management, and oversight in order to enhance our understanding of the genomic and
epigenomic basis of AUD. This Core will also manage community outreach and training programs within CARE.
Overall, the Administrative Core will maintain a productive and interactive environment to enhance epigenetic
research in AUD. This multidisciplinary endeavor will help us identify novel therapeutic molecular targets to
prevent and treat AUD.

10819180,"Project Summary
The goal of the Epigenetics Core is to provide a robust common platform for the identification and analysis of
genes affected by withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure in the brain. During the current funding period, the
Epigenetics Core identified gene networks both induced and repressed by alcohol exposure or withdrawal in the
amygdala, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area and limbic cortex and specific target genes that showed
changes in RNA levels, as well as, in H3K9/14ac levels were functionally validated.
 In the current submission, the proposed Aims will allow preclinical CARE Research Projects (Projects 1-3)
to obtain novel information regarding genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) and histone
methylation (H3K27me3 ChIP-seq). These findings will be integrated with data obtained during the current
funding period (RNA-seq and H3K9/14ac ChIP-seq). We will also perform ATAC-seq and RNA-seq in the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the alcohol use disorder (AUD)/control cohort obtained from the New South Wales
Tissue Resource Center (Project 4). In addition, we will investigate the across genome levels of 5-
hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in the same tissue using Illumina’s EPIC Methylation Array. Results from these
studies will reveal brain region-selective changes in genes that are likely to contribute to alcohol use disorders.
The above studies constitute Aim 1 of the Core. Aim 2 proposes bioinformatics pipelines for the analyses of the
genome-wide datasets and the 5hmC array and integrating the large datasets for both preclinical and post-
mortem studies. The integration of datasets from multiple non-biased approaches is innovative and will provide
context for interpreting changes in the gene regulatory landscape in response to withdrawal from alcohol. In Aim
3, we propose to employ a novel dCas9:P300 acetyl transferase fusion protein to alter acetylation levels at
specific genomic loci. This will allow us to activate expression of key genes in specific brain regions by altering
acetylation selectively at their corresponding promoters. Similarly, we will use a dCas9:Tet1 fusion protein to
alter 5mC and 5hmC levels at glucocorticoid receptor (Nr3c1) to modulate mRNA expression.
 The Epigenetics Core is using state-of-the-art technology to obtain genome-wide information to provide
additional resources for each CARE component to address their specific hypotheses. The Core will perform
quality control measures at many of the key steps of the protocols described above. In addition, key findings in
the genome-wide measures will be validated by Core personnel in consult with Project leaders. The Epigenetics
Core is an important platform, not only for individual CARE Projects, but also for University-wide NIH-funded
epigenetics investigators."
10819182,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure is associated with a number of symptoms including neuronal
hyperexcitability, heightened irritability, and a negative affective state. In addition, acute withdrawal is associated
with escalated and uncontrolled alcohol consumption, which is thought to occur, at least in part, due to negative
reinforcement as drinking alleviates withdrawal symptoms. The brain undergoes significant neuroadaptations
during withdrawal from chronic alcohol exposure. These neuroadaptive processes are thought to play an
important role in driving maladaptive behaviors including continued alcohol consumption. During the current
funding period CARE investigators have uncovered a number of significant, epigenetically regulated changes in
gene expression in the brains of rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol exposure. Interestingly, while some
withdrawal-induced epigenetic modifications appear to be common throughout the brain, many are brain region-
specific. CARE investigators have further demonstrated that reversal of some of these epigenetic alterations
attenuates withdrawal symptoms including those associated with negative affect and altered neurotransmission.
However, it is not yet known whether withdrawal-induced epigenetic dysregulation promotes escalated alcohol
consumption. The proposed Behavioral Core will allow CARE investigators to address this gap by providing the
resources necessary to link withdrawal-induced epigenetic changes with alterations in drinking behavior across
all four Research Projects of the CARE. The Behavioral Core will provide CARE investigators with oversight of
experimental design, implementation, and analysis of standardized behavioral experiments measuring operant
ethanol self-administration in control and ethanol withdrawn rats following either systemic or region-specific
reversal of withdrawal-induced epigenetic alterations. The Behavioral Core will also facilitate centralized
production of brain tissue from control rats and rats withdrawn from chronic ethanol liquid diet for experiments
conducted by the Epigenetics Core. The results generated by the Behavioral Core will allow CARE investigators
to establish a causal link between epigenetic modifications and escalated alcohol consumption. Together with
findings from each Research Project, these data will inform future work aimed at the development of novel drugs
targeting epigenetic factors for the treatment of alcohol use disorders."
10819184,"Project Summary:
The objective of pilot project core of the P50 application for “Center for Alcohol Research in Epigenetics (CARE)”
is to serve as a platform to bring new research directions in alcohol research and attract new investigators to
alcohol research field. The overall hypothesis of the CARE is that chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal
changes the epigenome to produce differential gene expression patterns that mechanistically alter brain
function during the pathogenesis of alcohol use disorder. We have included two exciting and relevant pilot
projects, epigenetic biomarkers in AUD and the epitranscriptome’s role in AUD. A second set of pilot projects
will also be announced and then selected for the 3rd and 5th years of CARE funding to cover several important
research areas which includes epigenetic basis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and tramautic brain
injury (TBI) comorbid with AUD. Studies clearly suggest that HDAC inhibitors are able to attenuate alcohol
consumption in several animal models of alcoholism. Vorinostat (SAHA) is FDA-approved for the treatment of
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, therefore we propose to conduct an initial clinical study of SAHA in AUD as one of
the future pilot projects. Another area that will be explored is single cell epigenomics in AUD. The administrative
core of the CARE will provide leadership, overall management, and oversight of current and future pilot projects.
The Specific Aims of the pilot project component are: 1) To manage the operation, progress, and completion
of current and future pilot projects during CARE funding. 2) To announce new pilot projects and manage
the review process by the members of Program Advisory Committee of the CARE. New pilot projects will
attract new investigators and interesting research areas to the alcohol research field. These pilot projects will
furthermore strengthen the epigenetic theme of CARE and allow these investigators to apply for NIH funding
mechanisms to become full-fledged alcohol researchers, thus fulfilling the objectives of the Pilot Project Core."
10819185,"Project Summary
As a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD), the withdrawal syndrome includes both negative symptoms like
anxiety and motivational symptoms such as craving for alcohol, which promotes relapse and alcohol seeking.
Understanding how alcohol withdrawal changes brain physiology is an important step towards developing
effective treatments to reduce alcohol abuse. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is an important brain area that
projects to components of the extended amygdala, including the nucleus accumbens, prefrontal cortex,
amygdala and hippocampus. Changes in the physiology of VTA neurons induced by withdrawal may underlie
the alcohol-seeking during AUD. The sensitivity of neurons of the VTA to inhibition by gamma aminobutyric acid
(GABA) is decreased during alcohol withdrawal but normalized by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors,
indicating epigenetic changes induced by withdrawal in the VTA may be amenable to pharmacological
manipulation. Whole genome sequencing and molecular studies of this project identified a cluster of genes that
encode cholesterol synthesis pathway enzymes that showed decreased expression during alcohol withdrawal,
and are functionally relevant to decreased GABA sensitivity in VTA neurons during withdrawal. The proposed
project plans to further characterize the role of specific epigenetic modifications in withdrawal-induced regulation
of genes responsible for cholesterol synthesis, and the effect of these changes in withdrawal-induced GABA
hyposensitivity and drinking behaviors. By using electrophysiological, behavioral, and state of the art molecular
biological methods such as chemogenetics and CRISPR technology, we anticipate achieving the following goals:
1) to reveal novel epigenetic marks and changes in gene expression associated with chronic alcohol exposure
and withdrawal with whole genome approaches, 2) to examine whether decreased histone acetylation and
increased histone methylation reduce expression of cholesterol synthesis enzymes in the VTA during withdrawal
in a cell-type specific manner, and probe the role of cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes in withdrawal-related
drinking behavior and GABA hyposensitivity, 3) to determine whether targeted epigenetic intervention
counteracts withdrawal-induced phenotypes by using CRISPR to prevent decreases in histone acetylation on
promoters of key cholesterol synthesis enzyme genes, and 4) to translate to post-mortem human alcoholic VTA
the epigenetic dynamics and expression of genes related to GABA hyposensitivity that have been identified in
the rat VTA. Ultimately, these studies are needed to understand epigenetic adaptation of VTA neurons involved
in the positive affective state during alcohol withdrawal, and, with the other components of this Center, will
provide a great deal of information on epigenetic mechanisms involved in withdrawal-induced brain changes,
and possible pharmacological approaches toward more effective treatment of AUD."
10819188,"Project Summary:
The emerging preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that symptoms associated with alcohol
withdrawal/negative affect is a primary risk factor for relapse and maintenance of alcohol use disorder (AUD).
Anatomical structures comprising the extended amygdala, particularly the central nucleus of amygdala (CeA),
are strongly implicated in anxiety and alcohol-drinking behaviors. Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone and
DNA chemical modifications, have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. This
research component of CARE will examine how epigenetic modifications induced by chronic alcohol
exposure and withdrawal at genome-wide level lead to an aberrant gene network pathway regulating
various biological processes in the amygdala, producing anxiety-like behavior and escalated alcohol
drinking. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To examine a) status of chromatin accessibility and loci of
genomic epigenetic marks using ATAC-seq and H3K27me3 ChIP-seq in the amygdala of rats (male & female)
during ethanol withdrawal after chronic ethanol exposure. The emerging data set will be merged with existing
RNA-seq and ChIP-seq (H3K9/14ac mark) to identify integrated epigenetic regulation of differential gene
expression in the amygdala. b) Dual specificity phosphatase 6 (Dusp6, novel gene identified by merger of
H3K9/14ac ChIP-seq/RNA-seq) siRNA will attenuate anxiety-like behaviors via activating CBP and increasing
histone acetylation of genes in the amygdala during ethanol withdrawal. 2) To examine if a) G9a siRNA infusion
in the CeA will attenuate anxiety-like behaviors, normalize epigenetic and gene expression changes as well as
deficits in synapses and dendritic spines in the amygdala of rats during ethanol withdrawal; b) Neuronal
stimulation in the CeA using a chemogenetic (Gq coupled DREADD) approach will attenuate anxiety-like
behaviors via restoring the proper balance in HDAC2/CBP regulation thereby leading to increased histone
acetylation of target genes in the amygdala during ethanol withdrawal and c) Neuron-specific p300HAT guided
by CRISPR-dCas9 infusion into CeA will increase histone acetylation at target genes, leading to increased gene
expression in the amygdala, attenuation of anxiety-like behaviors and escalated drinking during withdrawal. 3)
To examine whether CeA infusion of a HDAC2 and G9a siRNA will attenuate ethanol dependence-induced
escalation in drinking in male and female rats, as measured by operant ethanol-self administration. 4) To
translate epigenetic dynamics and expression of genes in the amygdala of alcohol dependent rats to postmortem
amygdala of human alcoholics and correlate them to drinking data. Completion of proposed studies will
provide new information on the epigenetic regulation of the whole transcriptome in the amygdala,
leading to identification of molecular targets for the development of pharmacotherapy of AUD."
10819189,"Project Summary
The overarching hypothesis of the Center for Alcohol Research in Epigenetics (CARE) is that epigenetic
mechanisms drive alterations in the brain transcriptome after chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal, leading
to neuroadaptations that promote dependence-induced behaviors such as anxiety, depression, and escalated
ethanol intake. Research project 3 of CARE has identified aberrant expression of innate immune genes in the
hippocampus during withdrawal from chronic alcohol drinking. An increased neuroinflammatory response in the
hippocampus during withdrawal may cause depression-related behaviors that promote escalated alcohol intake.
Preliminary data suggests that the induction of neuroimmune genes during withdrawal may be driven by
increased expression of the histone demethylase KDM6B, which removes transcriptionally-repressive methyl
groups from histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). The upregulation of KDM6B during withdrawal from chronic
alcohol is predicted to decrease H3K27me3 at specific gene promoters and increase chromatin accessibility,
leading to increased gene expression.
 The first set of experiments will use unbiased methods to examine changes in chromatin accessibility
and H3K27me3 levels at genomic loci in the hippocampus during withdrawal. This will be accomplished using
the assay for transposase accessible chromatin and chromatin immunoprecipitation with H3K27me3 antibody
followed by DNA sequencing (ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq, respectively) in the hippocampus of rats that have been
treated with chronic ethanol and withdrawal in a dependence model (Lieber DeCarli ethanol liquid diet). These
experiments will be performed in collaboration with the Epigenetics and Behavioral Cores of CARE. The second
set of experiments will examine the role of KDM6B and H3K27me3 in the expression of specific neuroimmune
gene targets and determine, using viral-mediated RNA interference or a pharmacological inhibitor of KDM6B,
the functional role of KDM6B in depression-like behavior during withdrawal.
 In the third set of experiments, the mechanism of Kdm6b gene induction during alcohol withdrawal will
be investigated. Kdm6b expression is known to be regulated by STAT3, which is also increased and activated
in the hippocampus during withdrawal from chronic alcohol drinking. Previous studies have shown that STAT3
can interact with the histone deacetylase HDAC6 to regulate transcription. We will examine the regulation of
Kdm6b gene expression by STAT3 and HDAC6, and determine if pharmacological inhibition or RNAi-mediated
down-regulation of STAT3 or HDAC6 during withdrawal affects depression-like behavior and escalated ethanol
intake (in collaboration with the Behavioral Core) during withdrawal. Successful completion of these experiments
will further two goals of CARE, which are to delineate epigenetic mechanisms operative in alcohol use disorder
and identify new epigenetic targets for development of pharmacotherapy to treat alcohol use disorder."
10819190,"Project Summary
Environmental factors, including alcohol abuse and stress, cause long-lasting changes in the regulation of gene
expression in the brain via epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation. Similar to stress, alcohol
stimulates glucocorticoid release that bind to specific receptors, i.e., the glucocorticoid receptor (encoded by
NR3C1). As of today, little is known on the role of epigenetic DNA modifications in regulating the transcriptome
in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC, BA10) and rat PFC during chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal. The
goal of research component #4 is to interrogate genome-wide changes in DNA methylation of novel gene
networks, including the NR3C1 gene network in AUD patients. Additional goals are to study whether and how
altered DNA methylation and/or hydroxymethylation marks underlie the pathophysiology of AUD. The genome-
wide DNA methylation approach (Infinium MethylationEPICBeadChip, Illumina) will be used in prefrontal cortex
samples obtained from 30 pairs of controls and AUD subjects from the New South Wales Tissue Resource
Centre (University of Sydney, Australia). In preliminary studies we identified a differential pattern of total DNA
methylation in AUD for 5,254 genes. However, this technique does not differentiate 5-methyl-cytosine (5mC)
from 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine (5hmC). Here, we propose to investigate the genome–wide distribution of 5mC
and 5hmC using the TET bisulfite conversion method followed by the Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip assay.
Hence, we will examine the enrichment of 5hmC/5mC in association with changes in novel gene expression
measured by RNA-seq. Chromatin accessibility in association with previously identified epigenetic marks will be
assessed by Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq). Integration of different
whole-genome approaches, i.e. genome-wide DNA methylation, RNA-seq and ATAC-seq will allow an in-depth
investigation of the status of the epigenome in AUD. Additionally, using a reverse-translational approach, we
propose to mechanistically investigate downstream effects of DNA methylation on neuronal function in PFC and
on anxiety-like behaviors and escalation of alcohol self-administration in rats treated chronically with alcohol or
following a 24 h alcohol-withdrawal. Because we observed an increase of DNA methylation associated with a
downregulation of TET expression (the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 5mC to 5hmC), we propose the
use of a dCas9-Tet1-mediated protein approach to correct methylation deficits at the levels of NR3C1 and other
gene promoters in the PFC of rats and determine their effect on gene expression, anxiety and drinking behaviors.
The proposed study will help to identify in the human and rat brain novel epigenetic mechanisms that may provide
new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AUD."
10818561,"5-8% of the US population suffers from at least one autoimmune disease. An upward trajectory has
occurred in the last few decades, implicating diet, lifestyle, environment, and improved diagnostics. The
contributions of diet to this increased incidence have been attributed to the excessive consumption of ultra-
processed foods that drive systemic inflammation. Just as poor dietary habits can compromise health, diseases
can potentially be treated or prevented by diets that promote and restore metabolic homeostasis. Consistent
with this notion, we have demonstrated that a well-formulated ketogenic diet (KD), containing medium chain
triglycerides as the primary source of fat, can mitigate the visual and motor deficits in a mouse model of
autoimmunity called MOG-EAE. This model reconstitutes many of the signature ocular and motor pathologies
experienced by patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Neuromyelitis Optica. The goals of this application
are: (1) to identify the immuno-modulatory mechanisms by which a well-formulated KD preserves metabolic
homeostasis, gut health, and immune tolerance, (2) to determine if a KD can serve as an adjuvant to enhance
the vision-sparing capacity of existing MS treatments and (3) to determine if the KD can repair damaged nerves
by promoting remyelination. Our leading hypothesis is that a well-formulated KD promotes immune tolerance
and neuroprotection by creating a systemic anti-inflammatory milieu. Specific Aim 1 will identify the mechanisms
linking gut integrity and plasma fatty acids to optic neuritis, a painful and often blinding inflammation of the optic
nerve experienced by MS patients. Specific Aim 2 will determine if the KD can enhance the vision-sparing
capacity of several current MS treatments. Specific Aim 3 will identify novel immunological mechanisms that
mediate the efficacy of the KD during autoimmune challenge. This work combines psychophysical
measurements of vision, a novel reporter mouse, gut permeability assays, high resolution lipidomics, adoptive
transfer assays, and blood analyses for markers of inflammation and metabolic/cardiovascular status. This work
is distinguished from previous studies by comparing the anatomic-specific effects of the KD at each of the primary
sites of MS lesions (optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain).
 These studies are designed to overcome the serious adverse effects associated with current MS
treatments by empowering patients with a readily-implementable dietary strategy to prevent or reduce flare ups
of optic neuritis and other debilitating sequelae. Additionally, these findings will provide a framework to facilitate
interpreting outcomes from the numerous clinical trials currently testing the KD across a range of diseases."
10818563,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and lethal breast cancer subtype more commonly
diagnosed on younger (<40y) women of color (Hispanics and African American), who are more likely to have
disease recurrence and who have an overall shorter survival. Furthermore, additional limitations (i.e. drug
toxicity, and therapy resistance) persist in the clinic for TNBC patients. Thus, a critical need exists to discover
more desirable targeted therapeutic modalities that selectively target TNBC tumor cells while leaving normal
cells unaffected, enhancing a complete response and reducing TNBC-associated mortality rates. Accordingly,
our goal is to reduce BC mortality by identifying unique vulnerabilities of TNBC that can be exploited through the
development of selective therapeutic agents. We recently identified the natural product ergosterol peroxide a
steroidal compound found in fungi, as a potent antiproliferative agent against TNBC cell models with little to no
effect on noncancerous cells. We demonstrated that EP is more potent towards TNBC than HER2-positive
models. EP induces ROS and apoptosis in TNBC cells and reduces tumor volume in TNBC models in vivo.
However, EP’s mode of action (MOA) remains to be defined. Extended periods of oxidative stress in the
mitochondria lead to accumulation of damaged proteins, which are normally removed by ubiquitination via the
VCP/ANKZF1 pathway. We have synthesized EP in gram scale and show that EP accumulates in the cytosol
and affects VCP and ANKZF1 interactions, raising the possibility that the VCP/ANKZF1 complex is targeted
during its assembly prior to arriving to the mitochondria. Thus, taking advantage of TNBC’s dependency on sterol
uptake, removal of misfolded proteins and altered redox homeostasis, we propose that EP serves as a
VCP/ANKZF1 complex protein-protein inhibitor (PPI). We hypothesize that EP targets the VCP/ANKZF1
complex, impairing the ability of cancer cells to clear damaged proteins and causing mitochondria dysfunction to
induce TNBC cell death. To test the hypothesis we will identify the mechanism by which EP targets the
VCP/ANKZF1 complex in TNBC models using biophysical assays and synthesized EP-probes (Aim 1). The
results from this Aim will validate that targeting VCP/ANKZF1 complex induces increases misfolded and
aggregated proteins, which lead to cancer cell death. We will determine the efficacy of EP using syngeneic
models injected with doxycycline inducible ANKZF1 silenced cells, and in TNBC PDXs. EP safety and bio-
availability will also be determined and studied by MTD and PK/PD (Aim 2). The result of this aim will provide
data needed for the next step towards the translational development of EP. Student participation in this
hypothesis-driven research will improve the pipeline for URM students in biomedical research and lead to
improved BC treatment."
10818478,"Project Summary
Advanced multi-spectrum magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) methods allow the non-invasive
measurement of the concentration of neurochemicals, but also of other biophysical properties. The currently
available one-dimensional modeling tools cannot adequately model such data because they are incapable of
incorporating prior knowledge about the relationships between sub-spectra into a single multi-dimensional model.
Additional parameters that can be encoded in the acquisition, but not adequately accommodated within the
quantification model include metabolite relaxation times, metabolite diffusion tensors, and physiological
metabolic response to external stimulation.
This project addresses the gap in currently available modeling tools for MRS by introducing a generalized linear
combination modeling framework for MRS. This avoids the overfitting that arises from serial application of current
one-dimensional models, dramatically increasing model parsimony. All code developed will be made available
to the community open-source, and the modeling framework will be made available in the cloud via a web user
interface."
10818416,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
HIV-1 infection is involved in many pathogenic processes in the body. While immunodeficiency and opportunistic
infections represent the end-point of the disease process, significant co-morbidity occurs with CNS involvement
resulting in neurocognitive decline and loss of quality of life. These are difficult problems to study either in people
living with HIV-1 or in model systems. However, advances in the development if iPSC lines and in their
differentiation into specific cell types and even multi-cell lineage organoids provide new opportunities to study
the effects of insults to the cell types found in the brain in the cell culture setting. There are ongoing, concurrent
epidemics of HIV-1, opioids, and amyloid fibril disease that all provide insults to the brain. HIV-1 infection often
includes the use of suppressive therapy with questions of CNS penetration and viral latency. In addition, HIV-1
leads to a heightened state of inflammation, another toxic insult to the brain. HIV-1 infection and/or opioid use
occur in a background of natural aging which often includes the subclinical deposition of amyloid fibrils. In this
application we will look at the intersection of these phenomena as they affect HIV-1 infection and latency and
also impact normal cell function. We will focus individually on microglia, astrocytes, and neurons then use the
information obtained from the individual cells to study their interactions in organoids. This application brings
together a team with expertise in neuroHIV, transcription analysis, opioid and HIV-1 interactions, organoids, and
fibril disease. This interdisciplinary approach will allow us to exploit the CNS organoid model to develop new
information that can ultimately be validated in whole organism studies in the future."
10819208,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating event sustained by as many as 1.3 million Americans. While not often
appreciated, cardiovascular disease and susceptibility to infection are leading causes of mortality and morbidity
in individuals living with SCI. One major reason thought to underlie these issues is SCI-induced dysregulation
of the sympathetic nervous system. In this proposal, we will use a clinically-relevant contusion rodent SCI model
to test the hypothesis that intracellular sigma peptide (ISP) will promote sufficient sprouting of serotonergic
axons onto neurons in the spinal sympathetic circuit below the SCI to normalize sympathetic activity after injury.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that administering a combining ISP and inhibition of soluble tumor necrosis factor
alpha (sTNFα) with XPro1595 – which target different root causes of sympathetic hyperreflexia after SCI (i.e.,
interrupted supraspinal input the spinal sympathetic circuit and sTNFα-induced maladaptive plasticity of the
spinal sympathetic circuit, respectively) – will have synergistic effects on improving cardiovascular and immune
function after SCI."

10808947,"ABSTRACT
 Alkylating agents are ubiquitously present in the environment, and they can alkylate DNA and RNA directly
or after metabolic activation. The focus of the present R35 application is placed on the chemistry and biology of
DNA and RNA alkylation, with the overarching goal of understanding the molecular mechanisms through which
alkylating agents and other environmental chemicals exert their adverse human health effects. In particular, we
will examine the roles of translesion synthesis DNA polymerases in the transcriptional bypass of DNA lesions in
cultured human cells, identify DNA damage recognition proteins for alkylated DNA lesions, and investigate their
roles in DNA damage response signaling and repair. We will also assess the implications of RNA methylation in
the molecular pathology of trinucleotide repeat expansion diseases. The proposed research is a culmination of
our established expertise in the areas of DNA damage and repair, proteomics and epitranscriptomics.
Completion of the proposed research will lead to an unprecedented level of understanding about the human
health consequences of exposure to alkylating agents and other environmental toxicants, and will ultimately
result in approaches for the prevention and mitigation of adverse human health consequences arising from
environmental exposure."
10806791,"Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC) is the 2nd leading cause of death from cancer
worldwide and it is the only cancer for which both the incidence and mortality are rising. Traditionally liver
cancer was associated with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis B or C viruses, or alcohol consumption but more
recently obesity or the metabolic syndrome accounts for the highest attributable fraction of HCC (37%) in the
US. Approximately 80-90% of obese adults have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and the metabolic syndrome,
and a subset will go on to develop inflammation and NASH. Obesity is also a risk factor for HBV and HCV-
related liver cancer and even alcoholic cirrhosis-related liver cancer. Furthermore, obesity reduces the efficacy
of anti-HBV vaccination, and increases HCC in individuals treated for HCV. As obese individuals are at a
higher risk of developing all types of HCC (non-viral, viral and alcoholic), there is a critical need to understand
the changes that occur in the liver during obesity, which can guide both prevention efforts and the development
of novel efficacious treatments for HCC.
 Alternative RNA splicing is generally thought to fine tune gene expression and cellular function in
various tissues and contexts but there is also evidence that changes in RNA splicing may have dramatic
effects on the pathogenesis of disease by switching expression of protein isoforms that may have opposing or
antagonistic effects. In the liver, changes in RNA splicing have been documented during development and the
maturation of hepatocytes as well as in HCC but most studies in early liver disease, NAFLD or NASH, have
focused on total mRNA changes rather than changes in individual mRNA isoforms and alternative splicing. The
idea that these changes may be causative for, rather than the result of, liver disease is supported by
accumulating evidence from genetic manipulation of individual splicing factors in mice that contribute to liver
disease. Lipid and glucose metabolism, fibrosis and inflammation are all processes that may be influenced by
alternative splicing and they all may contribute to disease progression. Functional assessment of isoforms is
essential however, as it is not possible a priori to predict the effect of a splice variant on protein activity. We
propose to study two isoform switching events in the insulin receptor (IR) and Yes associated protein 1 (YAP1),
which we have documented during early NAFLD in mice and humans, that may contribute to NASH and HCC."
10806508,"Currently, 10.7% of Americans aged 65 and older have Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related
Dementias (AD/ADRD). By 2050, 14% (12.7 million) will be affected. Racial and ethnic minorities bear uneven
burdens; nearly 19% of Black and 14% of Hispanic older adults have AD/ADRD compared to 10% of White
older adults. Patients with AD/ADRD (referred to as Persons Living with Dementia [PLWD]) often lack access
to high-quality care and have poorer outcomes, such as higher hospital and emergency department (ED) use.
While caring for PLWD and eliminating health disparities are national priorities, the current primary care system
is ill-prepared, mainly due to primary care physician shortages. Nurse practitioners (NPs), the fastest-growing
primary care workforce, who disproportionately care for racial and ethnic minorities, are vital for dementia care.
Increasingly, NPs lead team-based care, and primary care models that leverage NP teams can address PLWD
disparities. Yet, NP teams are poorly studied, and little is known about which teams deliver the best care. To
design high-performing NP teams, it is key to identify members of NP teams (team configuration), understand
how team members communicate, seek advice, and share support, and show how these connections (social
networks) affect PLWD outcomes. Building on our work on teams, social networks, dementia care, and health
disparities, our novel, national mixed-methods study will produce this evidence. Using novel methods, including
social network analysis (SNA), positive deviance, and the Delphi technique, we aim to 1. Identify NP team
configurations and social networks (i.e., communication, advice, trust, support, and problem-solving) in primary
care practices caring for PLWD. 2. Assess how NP team configurations and social networks impact PLWD
outcomes (i.e., hospitalizations, ED use) and evaluate racial and ethnic disparities in these outcomes. 3.
Identify barriers, facilitators, and characteristics of teamwork in NP teams with different configurations and
social networks. 4.Develop and disseminate practice and policy recommendations to design and implement NP
teams in primary care practices to care for PLWD and achieve health equity. We will conduct a social network
survey of a national sample of NPs caring for PLWD to map their teams using SNA. By merging these data
with data on hospital and ED use and applying regression models, we will assess the NP team's impact on
PLWD outcomes and racial and ethnic disparities. Using positive deviance, we will interview NPs from variably
configured teams (e.g., small, large) and with different networks (e.g., highly, poorly connected) from Aim 1 to
understand the context in which NP teams function. We will triangulate findings to design practice and policy
recommendations and refine them through Delphi method with a panel of patient advocates, practice leaders,
clinicians, and policy experts. Our findings will inform key stakeholders seeking to enhance dementia care
delivery and the effectiveness of the dementia workforce. Our application is in response to Notice of Special
Interest (NOSI) NOT-AG-21-049 to enhance the Dementia Care Workforce for Those Living with AD/ADRD."
10806641,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Research into the mechanisms underlying methamphetamine craving, a key driver of relapse, is dwarfed in
comparison to other drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine, opioids). Exacerbated drug craving can be modeled in rats
using the incubation of methamphetamine craving paradigm. The nucleus accumbens plays a key role in
mediating drug seeking which intensifies commensurate with abstinence duration. Approximately 95% of
accumbens neurons are GABAergic medium spiny neurons which can be distinguished by expression of the
D1 dopamine receptors (D1DRs) or D2 dopamine receptors (D2DRs), although a relatively small proportion of
these cells express both of these receptors. Canonically, D1DR-containing neurons were thought to project
exclusively to the ventral tegmental area, whereas D2DR-expressing accumbens efferents extended to the
ventral pallidum; however, recent evidence suggests that there is some overlap such that D1DR-containing
neurons also project to the ventral pallidum and modulate drug seeking. Generally, D1DR-containing neurons
promote drug-related behaviors, whereas D2DR-containing neurons inhibit drug-related behaviors. Importantly,
the influence of specific projections of these neuronal subtypes on methamphetamine seeking is unknown.
Specific Aim 1 will combine D1DR-Cre and D2DR-Cre transgenic rats, optogenetics, and electrophysiology to
dissociate the role of D1DR- vs. D2DR-containing striatopallidal and striatotegmental projections in the
incubation of methamphetamine craving. The time-dependent molecular adaptations within accumbens D1DR-
containing and D2DR-containing neurons that occur during abstinence from methamphetamine are also
unexplored. Very recent advances in single cell sequencing methodologies have enabled simultaneous
profiling of the transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in defined cell populations. This is particularly relevant
for the current proposal since it will allow us to differentiate in silico effects in accumbens neurons which
express either the D1DR or D2DR. Specific Aim 2 will define the landscape of accessible chromatin and gene
expression by coupling ATAC sequencing and RNA sequencing from the same single nuclei droplets in rats
following short or prolonged abstinence from methamphetamine. Functional validation of a candidate gene will
be performed by bidirectionally manipulating gene expression in selectively in D1DR-containing or D2DR-
containing neurons and assessing the incubation of methamphetamine craving. Collectively, the proposed
studies will elucidate the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying the incubation of
methamphetamine craving."
10795972,"The representation of women and persons excluded due to ethnicity and race (PEER) in neuroscience research at undergraduate, graduate and early postdoctoral levels has improved, but these gains are slow, and they have had little effect at senior levels. Data show PEER and women are lost from the talent pool disproportionately toward the end of their postdoctoral studies and at entry to independent positions. The root causes that lead to the attrition of talented individuals, with great potential and promise, are ongoing and accumulate over the course of each individual's career, but actions can be taken to lower these barriers. We will leverage Brown’s commitment to equity and inclusion, successes in enhancing diversity and inclusion at undergraduate and pre- doctoral level training, and the participation of faculty from across brain and quantitative sciences to enhance the pool of highly qualified neuroscientists contributing to neuroscience research. We propose new programming focused on three key areas: 1) structured mentorship, 2) professional and quantitative skills development, and 3) supported research experiences. This plan aims to: cultivate a cohort of highly competitive and successful PEER and female postdoctoral trainees and junior faculty who excel in neuroscience research and who successfully transition to the next career phase (Aim 1); create a dynamic program that responds to training and mentoring needs of our participants, that continually incorporates best practices from across the country, and that disseminates the results and know-how beyond Brown (Aim 2); contribute to a culture at Brown and beyond that strives for equity and inclusion in all aspects of scientific training and mentorship, and access to opportunities (Aim 3). A system of multi-level input from participants, mentors, internal and external advisors include regular assessment and feedback that inform ongoing program improvements. A comprehensive dissemination plan will ensure broad impact and contribute to fundamental cultural change, at Brown University and beyond, that prioritizes equity and inclusion in all aspects of scientific training. By building inclusive practices into the fabric of mentoring, research, and training, participating faculty and mentoring teams will support the continued growth of such a culture. These actions will develop cohorts of talented neuroscientists who will progress in research careers to advance discoveries, technology development, and innovations that contribute to diagnoses, treatments and cures for diseases and disorders of the brain and nervous system."
10793257,"Summary
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a severe age-related lung disease that affects millions of people
worldwide. It causes progressive lung dysfunction leading to death, usually within a few years of diagnosis.
Two targeted drugs are available to treat IPF, but they merely slow lung function decline. The only cure for IPF
is lung transplantation. Thus, new treatments with potential to cure IPF are direly needed. A growing body of
evidence implicates the bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) in the pathophysiology of IPF.
S1P promotes inflammation and fibrosis by activating a family of G protein-coupled receptors (S1PRs), thus
stimulating signaling pathways that interact with TGFa multifunctional cytokine with a central role in fibrosis.
Drugs targeting S1PRs are already on the market or in clinical trials for treating autoimmune diseases.
Although targeting S1P appears to have a promising future in treatment of fibrotic diseases, chronic S1PR
antagonism and the immunosuppression it causes increase the risk of cancer and neurodegenerative disease,
especially in older patients. Thus, alternative S1P-targeting approaches may be needed in the context of IPF.
S1P lyase (SPL), encoded by SGPL1, catalyzes the final step of sphingolipid metabolism in which S1P is
irreversibly degraded. We find that endogenous lung SPL plays a protective role in pulmonary fibrosis. Further,
we demonstrate that augmenting SPL activity by intravenous delivery of an adeno-associated virus 9
expressing human SGPL1 (AAV-SPL) to mice 10-14 days after bleomycin treatment attenuates lung TGF
signaling and pulmonary fibrosis. Our findings have led us to hypothesize that AAV-SPL represents a novel
single-dose IPF treatment that acts by reducing lung S1P and downstream profibrogenic signaling. It does so
without causing immunosuppression, thus providing an S1P targeting approach superior to S1PR antagonists.
In this proposal, we will confirm our hypothesis and advance AAV-SPL as a therapeutic agent for IPF. In the
R61 phase of this award, we will rigorously validate the efficacy of AAV-SPL in IPF and confirm the cellular
target for AAV-SPL. In Aim One, we will measure the impact of AAV-SPL on lung fibrosis: a) in a mouse IPF
model in which the Trf1 gene encoding a telomere-specific protein is disrupted specifically in lung alveolar type
II cells, and b) in cytokine-stimulated and IPF precision cut lung slices. In Aim Two, we will create a lung
epithelial cell-specific Sgpl1 knockout mouse and demonstrate that it develops pulmonary fibrosis. In the
project’s R33 phase, we will begin to characterize AAV-SPL’s pharmacological characteristics. In Aim Three,
we will optimize AAV-SPL performance by comparing potency, bioavailability, and early safety profile after
intravenous versus intratracheal delivery in murine models of IPF. The R33 phase will culminate in completion

10796885,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Project 1 (PR1)
Immune development in early Life (IDEAL) involves complex processes with heterogeneous influences that
establish immunologic trajectories and impart long-term health consequences1. While genetics play an important
role, environmental exposures also substantially shape innate and adaptive immunity1, suggesting that IDEAL is
modifiable. Historically, research has relied on clinical phenotypes to identify immune mechanisms, presuming
that phenotypic similarity reflects common etiology2,3. While often true, this approach becomes increasingly
complex with multifactorial etiology, as is the case with immune outcomes related to IDEAL. We contend that
the considerable heterogeneity of mechanisms regulating immune ontogeny may best be identified via
endotypes of IDEAL- subclasses of disease defined by distinct underlying mechanisms. Derived
endotypes informed by multiOMIC systems biology capture complex biological processes4 that provide an
integrated view of immunity and will identify biological mechanisms related to different immunologic trajectories.
Our hypothesis is that clinically meaningful “IDEAL endotypes” exist and can be identified through the
use of multiOMIC profiling, further informed by clinical phenotype. This approach further enables
identification of actionable multiOMIC biomarkers that may be utilized in a precision medicine framework to
classify, predict and/or optimize immune trajectories of specific IDEAL endotypes. Our approach in IDEAL Project
1 (PR1) considers integrated systems biology in conjunction with longitudinal follow-up for the select clinical
outcomes of vaccine response (VR), respiratory infection proneness (IP), and asthma. To this end, we will
utilize four large, ethnically diverse early-life cohorts with precise clinical phenotypes and longitudinal follow-up
up thru 6 years (YR) of age. We capitalize on two cohorts with existing multiOMIC data for discovery: Vitamin D
Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART; N=650), and the Expanded Program on Immunization Consortium-
Human Immune Project Consortium (EPIC-HIPC; N=500); and two cohorts with dense biosample collection for
replication, in which multiOMIC data will be generated via the proposed studies: the Rochester Combined Cohort
(RCC; N=400) and the proposed prospective Rochester IDEAL cohort (RIC; N=200). We will define IDEAL
endotypes and identify endotype-specific actionable biologic targets via the following Specific Aims (SAs): SA1)
Identify multiOMIC variants of IDEAL clinical phenotypes; SA2) Define and characterize robust “IDEAL
endotypes” through the synthesis of unbiased multiOMIC endotypes; and SA3) Using a multiOMIC framework,
identify actionable biomarker targets for IDEAL endotypes that merit further functional interrogation in vitro in PR

10796888,"SUMMARY – Project 2 (PR2)
 Early life microbial exposures can shape an individual’s basal immune state influencing acute responses
to infections, vaccines and responses to environmental allergens. Perinatal microbial exposures are known to
influence immune ontogeny and are linked to rising rates of allergy and asthma, yet mechanisms remain poorly
defined. Colonisation of the mucosae by microbiota, vaccinations and systemic infections all modify immune
ontogeny, but a mechanistic understanding of the combinatorial interactions of these events in the early life
course, and their resulting programming effects on immune development in early life (IDEAL) are lacking. Project
2 (PR2) will investigate epigenetic mechanisms as a basis for understanding microbially-mediated programming
of IDEAL. A growing body of work highlights an important role for epigenetic regulation of the genome in both
central and peripheral immune cells following vaccination and infection. Dynamic changes in epigenetic
modifications at gene enhancers and promoters in innate cells are mechanistically linked to pathogen recognition
receptor (PRR) signalling. These mechanisms therefore bridge the microbial environment, host genome and
immune ontogeny. Early life microbial exposures are a complex construct considering the broad scope of
interactions and factors to consider. Yet our collaborators in the Clinical Core (CC; Lead Pichichero) have
demonstrated reproducibly that some children display a phenotype of low production of protective antibody (Ab)
levels to routine vaccinations with concomitant low cellular immune memory (low vaccine responders, LVR),
whilst others exhibit robust protective immunity (high vaccine responders, HVR). In addition to this, some children
are prone to recurrent respiratory infections (infection prone, IP) whilst others with similar pathogen burden are
resilient (non-infection prone, NIP). These phenotypic subgroups will be capitalized upon as latent variables that
reflect the construct of microbially-mediated immune programming through a latent class analysis. The overall
effort will define trajectories of mucosal and systemic (e.g., immune ontogeny and microbiome across our IDEAL
Meta Cohort (IMC) comprised of four diverse longitudinal childhood cohorts in relation to VR, IP and asthma.
Epigenome-wide association analysis will identify methylation-sensitive genes that characterize trajectories of
IDEAL. We posit that these phenotypes and sub-phenotypes of IDEAL contribute to the development of
childhood illness and will therefore identify methylation-sensitive genes associated with IDEAL trajectories that
predict endotypes and sub-phenotypes of VR, IP and asthma. We consider endotypes are likely to have distinct
pathophysiology mechanisms and that epigenetic biomarkers of microbially-mediated immune programming can
provide early detection as well as novel targets for precision interventions. Outcomes from PR2 will include
enhanced mechanistic understanding of early immune programming, knowledge gains regarding genomic
elements/pathways contributing to endotypes of VR, IP and asthma, prognostic biomarkers, and novel targets
for preventive interventions."
10796890,"Project Summary – Project 3 (PR3)
 Immune development in early life (IDEAL) is dynamic and growing evidence suggests that it impacts the
risk for common undesirable clinical phenotypes including low vaccine responsiveness, and proneness to
respiratory infection and/or asthma. However, little is known regarding precise mechanisms nor how to redirect
immune development to more favorable phenotypes. The Precision Vaccines Program (PVP) at Boston Children’s
Hospital (BCH) has developed cutting-edge human in vitro assays which model age related changes in leukocyte
function- i.e., immune ontogeny and population (e.g. age)-specific effects and mechanisms of action of
immunomodulatory agents, including metabolites, proteins, adjuvants and vaccines.
 Project 3 (PR3) will leverage human in vitro modeling to gain insight into signaling pathways that are
relevant to the clinical phenotypes observed. Our published and unpublished preliminary data indicate that our
sample-sparing human in vitro assay platforms can model innate and adaptive immune responses of infants and
young children which vary by age and disease status. Our hypothesis is that our innate and adaptive in vitro
modeling platforms can meaningfully interrogate molecular signaling pathways relevant to endotypes
(disease sub-types) of clinical phenotypes such as vaccine responsiveness, respiratory infection and/or
asthma. Our goal is to leverage our cutting-edge human in vitro assay systems to model human immune cell
responses to infant vaccines as well as to confirm, assess and translate the pathways identified in PR1 and PR
2. We will achieve this goal by pursuing the following Specific Aims (SAs): SA1. Assess mechanisms
underlying IDEAL endotypes. In this aim we will pursue molecular interrogation of pathways, biomarkers,
metabolites discovered in PR1 and PR2. SA2. Identify immunomodulators that re-direct trajectories from
unfavorable to favorable endotypes. We will model immune activation in response to agents capable of re-
shaping immune endotypes, including agents that impact the relevant endotype-associated pathways identified
in PR1 and PR2 .
 Overall, successful completion of PR3 will provide fresh insight into IDEAL in relation to vaccine
responsiveness, infection and/or asthma proneness. This effort will provide mechanistic insight into IDEAL, help
confirm and probe novel prognostic biomarkers and pathways identified in PR1 and PR2, and identify agents (e.g.,
proteins, metabolites, adjuvants, vaccines) that can redirect human infant leukocytes away from unfavorable
endotypes associated with low vaccine responsiveness, respiratory infection and/or asthma and towards favorable
trajectories and endotypes thereby advancing child health."

integration of Center personnel to capitalize on the synergies and translational opportunities of the Yale-
SCORE, 2) support the development of new collaborative research within the Yale-SCORE and with other Yale
Centers and SCOREs at other institutions, 3) organize regular planning meetings to promote dynamic
exchange among investigators regarding new scientific findings and their implications for sex-appropriate
medications development, 4) facilitate the work of the Projects, Pilots, and Cores through fiscal and
administrative oversight, solicit, review and fund meritorious Pilot Projects, oversee the distribution of research-
related resources; provide input into the design of a core battery, and the collection of biosensor data to
maximize the scientific yield of the Center, and 5) educate and inform our communities and function as an
institutional, regional, and national resource to invigorate the study of sex and alcohol use. Our approach is
designed to ensure that the Project Leads, investigators, collaborators, and trainees operate in an integrated
scientific environment that creates a coordinated interdisciplinary translational team effort, focused on
advancing the development of sex-appropriate treatment for AUD. The goals of the Core will be accomplished
through the following specific aims. AIM 1: Provide integrated scientific research planning and oversight
among the Yale-SCORE’s Principal Investigator, Deputy Director, and Executive Committee, with targeted
consultation from the External Scientific Advisory Board. AIM 2: Ensure fiscal and administrative oversight to
the Yale-SCORE Projects and Pilot Projects. AIM 3: Be an institutional, regional, and national resource to
invigorate and galvanize the study of sex differences in relation to alcohol use across T1 to T4 translation by
providing expert consultation, supporting faculty training awards, leveraging national data on sex and alcohol
use to inform treatment and policy, and by providing outreach and dissemination to local community, regional,

10796985,"Rates of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) have increased by 84% in women over the past 10 years. Several
lines of evidence indicate that drinking behavior in women is more likely to be motivated by affect regulation
and stress, whereas drinking in men is motivated by stimulation and alcohol-related positive reinforcement. To
date, there has been no concerted effort to develop medications for AUD that target factors which differentially
maintain drinking in women. Using Koob & Volkow’s heuristic framework of the addiction cycle162, we will target
the ‘dark side of addiction’ for sex-appropriate AUD medication development. Project 1 will focus on a single
noradrenergic target, guanfacine, in order to be fully powered to examine sex by medication effects on
treatment outcomes. Importantly, Project 1 will provide a template to mechanistically evaluate sex differences
in AUD medication development. Our preliminary results demonstrate that guanfacine robustly reduces the
quantity, frequency, and percentage of binge episodes of alcohol consumption in both women and men, with
possibly larger effects in women. The neural mechanisms underlying this effect appear to be sex-dependent.
For women, guanfacine reduces drinking by reducing stress reactivity. For men, the evidence is less clear, but
guanfacine appears to target alcohol-related positive reinforcement. Consistent with the aim of the Yale-
SCORE to develop sex-appropriate therapeutics for AUD, and with the input and feedback of Project 2 & 3
Leads, we plan to conduct the first, fully-powered, mechanistic Phase 2b, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel-group study to examine sex differences in guanfacine's effect on: 1) counteracting stress- and
stimulation-based drinking behavior in the laboratory and 2) improving clinical outcomes during a subsequent
treatment phase. Importantly, we will examine the safety of guanfacine and potential sex differences in
mechanisms underlying drinking (e.g., craving, mood, cognitive function, cardiovascular reactivity, markers of
HPA-axis activity, cytokines, markers of alcohol-metabolism, sex steroid hormones, and subjective alcohol
effects). Additionally, we will use an innovative biosensor system to assess naturalistic drinking during the 6-
week treatment period. To our knowledge, this will be the first clinical trial investigation to prospectively
examine sex differences in the therapeutic potential and associated mechanisms of a selective α2a agonist,
guanfacine, for the treatment of AUD. Synthesis of findings across the three projects will identify new
neurobiological targets for sex-appropriate therapeutics for AUD."
10796841,"Generating adaptive body movements is a fundamental function of the brain. The primary motor cortex (M1) is
a central locus for motor learning and execution. M1 receives long-range inputs from several brain areas and
processes this information through local recurrent connections. However, how various inputs and local
connections work together to shape M1 activity is unknown. In this proposal, we will investigate the
contributions of long-range inputs and local connections to M1 activity and how they are shaped during motor
learning. We will do this using a well-established motor learning paradigm in mice. Our central hypothesis is
that the functional properties of individual M1 neurons are defined by their responses to long-range inputs and
local neurons. We further hypothesize that learning induces a reorganization of the responses of M1 neurons
to specific inputs. This proposal will investigate the nature of the information that M1 receives from various
upstream regions, the unique activity patterns of M1 neurons that receive these inputs, and how the local M1
network contributes to their activity patterns."
10796842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 15,000 patients receive life-saving kidney transplants in the US every year. Nevertheless, frequent
post-transplant complications limit the outlook for kidney transplant recipients. Urinary tract infections (UTIs),
including multi-drug antibiotic-resistant infections, occur at an alarmingly high rate after kidney transplantation.
At least 20% of kidney transplant recipients experience a serious UTI in the first 3 months after transplantation.
UTI has been associated with development of urosepsis, decreasing graft function, graft loss, and death.
The current gold standard for diagnosis of UTI is bacterial culture, which is fundamentally limited by its ability to
detect only culturable bacteria. Furthermore, bacterial culture does not inform about co-infections, commensal
microbiota, or the host response to infection. New biochemical and genetic approaches developed by our groups
can fundamentally change the paradigm for UTI diagnosis and transplant monitoring.
The goal of this proposal is to develop and apply precision medicine approaches for the monitoring of UTIs after
kidney transplantation. We will utilize (1) newly developed technologies for the metagenomic sequencing of
ultrashort fragments of cfDNA in urine, (2) new metagenomic host-response measurements, (3) technologies to
perform bioinformatic sorting of resistance determinants, and (4) new approaches to perform rapid cfDNA
metagenomic sequencing and direct profiling of epigenetic markers comprised within cfDNA based on Oxford
Nanopore Technologies.
In the first Aim, we will investigate the utility of metagenomic sequencing of urinary cfDNA as a tool to monitor
UTIs and to profile the urinary microbiome. This concept is supported by extensive pilot data. In the second Aim
we will investigate a cfDNA metagenomic sequencing assay that informs the degree of host injury due to
infection. This second Aim is also supported by significant results from pilot data. In the third Aim, we will
investigate the performance of novel, Nanopore sequencing technologies and algorithms that will enable a lower
cost, faster turnaround time, and greater utility of cfDNA metagenomic sequencing assays.
Together, these assays will provide new avenues to monitor infections of the urinary tract, profile antibiotic

More than 15,000 patients receive kidney transplants each year, and many of these patients suffer complications
from UTI. In the general population, UTI is one of the most common medical problems, with 150 million persons
affected per year worldwide. Successful implementation of these studies will provide new avenues for the
monitoring of bacterial UTI and will thereby address an acute medical need in kidney transplantation, and by

Diversity in the biomedical research workforce is necessary to solve the complex scientific problems that affect
society today. Diversity improves research quality and diverse teams are known to capitalize on innovation and
distinct perspectives to outperform non-diverse teams. Yet, individuals from certain groups remain
underrepresented in biomedical research. This provides the scientific community with an opportunity to enhance
the biomedical research workforce by increasing the diversity of participating individuals and improve research
efforts. The career transition between undergraduate and graduate school can be especially difficult to navigate.
The goal of Discovery Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) is to provide individuals from
diverse backgrounds with robust research experience and courses/workshops for skills development to promote
their transition into and success within biomedical PhD graduate programs. Discovery PREP was initiated in
2010, renewed in 2016, and has consistently received strong institutional support in terms of participant salary,
travel funds, test preparation, and programmatic support. The overall success of the program is good, with 84%
of scholars accepted into PhD graduate programs while within PREP since 2016. This competitive renewal seeks
to leverage recent successes and increase scholar training and support, through hands-on exposure and
mentoring in highly competitive laboratories, evidence-informed activities to support professional and personal
skills development, and summative and formative evaluations to establish the impact of the program on scholar
science self-efficacy, science identity, and sense of belonging within the academic research enterprise. Overall,
these efforts will create a cohort of passionate, effective, and highly skilled trainees that will enhance the diversity
of the scientific community and promote innovative solutions to address the tough scientific challenges in health
care today."

The Data Management and Statistics Core (Core C) of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer's Disease Research
Center (JHADRC) has four overarching goals: (1) to provide database design, data management and data
distribution for investigators associated with the ADRC, (2) to provide statistical expertise to investigators
associated with the ADRC, including consultation to the Developmental Projects funded by the JHADRC and
to projects of the trainees supported by the Research Education Component (REC), (3) to develop of novel
analytic methods for the study of ADRD, and (4) to mentor young investigators in the field. Through the
provision of efficient database design and data management, Core C assures the accuracy, accessibility, and
integration of data from the JHADRC, and provides data sets to the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center
(NACC) and to investigators associated with the ADRC, both within the institution and at other ADC sites.
Through the provision of high level statistical consultation to investigators associated with the Center, a range
of projects related to the JHADRC will be supported. Through the development of novel methods for the
study of ADRD, additional insights will be gained. Through mentoring young investigators, the next
generation will be trained in longitudinal methods related to cognitive decline and dementia."
10795982,"OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT AND ENGAGEMENT CORE: CORE E - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Outreach, Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core serves a central role in the JHADRC by (1)
facilitating recruitment of diverse subjects into the clinical research associated with the ADRC, (2) providing a
rich outreach and educational environment that fosters retention of subjects over time and maximizes
agreement to biomarker procedures and brain donation, and (3) conducting a range of educational programs in
the community at large that increases understanding about AD and related disorders, as well as the
importance of research. The success of the ORE Core requires integration of its activities with many of the
other Cores. Working closely with the Clinical Core, we will continue to recruit a diverse subject population into
the JHADRC and facilitate the involvement of these subjects in clinical research projects associated with the
JHADRC. We will expand on our current recruitment efforts in several ways, including by developing video
vignettes of study participants talking about the importance of research for finding improved treatments for
ADRD. Working closely with the Biomarker Core and the Neuropath Core, we will develop brochures and video
vignettes concerning the importance of biomarker procedures and brain donation. We will continue our existing
subject retention efforts, which includes annual activities aimed at all Clinical Core participants, as well as
some activities designed to specifically retain minority participants at a high level. We will continue our
educational programs in the community. These efforts will be expanded by seeking additional partners in the
minority community and by expanding our support of an educational program aimed at elementary and middle
school minority students in the public schools."
10794765,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Machine learning-based pathogenicity predictors, trained on known disease and non-disease-implicated
variants, predict whether a variant is pathogenic or benign. They have become a key component of genetic
variant discovery and clinical genetic testing. However, their use in individual-level genetic and genomic
disease risk prediction has been limited by their incompatibility with typically reported measures of risk, and
terminology associated with clinical decision-making. Variant pathogenicity predictors generally serve as a key
interpretation tool for rare variants in the absence of large enough cohorts to achieve statistical power. As the
clinical deployment of genetic and genomic risk prediction models becomes more widespread, it is essential
that rare variants be readily incorporated into these models and the risk conferred by such variants be correctly
accounted for. To address these gaps, the proposed study will develop methods for the systematic integration
and calibration of variant pathogenicity predictors into genetic and genomic disease risk prediction and will test
the hypothesis that these methods lead to more accurate and clinically interpretable predictions of disease risk.
This work will be carried out through three specific aims: (1) we will adapt and calibrate existing predictors for
gene-specific prediction of pathogenic variants, (2) we will develop variant pathogenicity predictor-based
exomic disease risk scores, and (3) we will integrate pathogenicity predictors into genome-wide polygenic risk
score (PRS) development. The principal investigator (PI) will bring deep expertise in variant pathogenicity
predictor development and model calibration to this project, and build a team with complementary expertise in
statistical genetics and polygenic risk score development to carry out the work. Additionally, the PI has
formulated a plan for his scientific and professional development, and will assemble an external advisory
committee with further complementarity of expertise (e.g., in population genetics and clinical genetics). This
project will leverage multiple large genome-phenotype data sets that are available publicly (UK Biobank,
dbGaP) and through the world-class infrastructure at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (BioMe).
This work is expected to have positive impact on multiple fronts. First, there are currently no systematic
integration and calibration frameworks for variant pathogenicity predictors that can be generalized for risk
prediction across different types of variants, genes and/or diseases. Second, open-source software to calibrate
the output of variant pathogenicity predictors in specific contexts (genes, diseases, among others) will be
developed and shared with the broader community. Finally, computationally derived estimates of prevalence of
pathogenic variants and risk models will be made available through Mount Sinai and NIH resources."

Chronic fibrosis is the pathological hallmark in a variety of disorders in many organs including the skin in patients
with systemic and limited sclerosis, aggressive fibromatoses, keloid, hypertrophic scarring, and atopic dermatitis.
Our laboratories recently uncovered an unexpected and intriguing role for mature adipocytes during skin fibrosis:
repression of ECM production. In particular, we identified that mature adipocytes undergo lipolysis to release
fatty acids in a Wnt-dependent mechanism and that adipocyte lipolysis is fibroprotective. Our findings are
important for several reasons. First, adipocytes have been shown to improve scarring yet how mature adipocytes
function in this process is unclear. Second, adipose tissue loss is a major clinical issue in the skin and an early
event in the development of skin fibrosis. Furthermore, adipocytes and their derivatives (fatty acids and/or
cytokines) are a tractable cell type to create a personalized therapy to promote healing in patients with fibrosis.
Through two focused and complementary Specific Aims, the work proposed in this application will take
advantage of multiple genetic mouse models that allow specific abrogation of adipocyte lipolysis and fibrosis
development, lipidomics, and fibroblast culture assays to define the function of adipocyte lipolysis during skin
fibrosis. Our goals are to test whether: 1. adipocyte-derived fatty acids abrogate ECM production during fibrosis
development; and 2. Wnts stimulate lipolysis of dermal adipocytes. Towards these goals, in Aim1, we will define
the cellular and molecular changes by which lipolysis alters mouse skin and if dermal adipocyte lipids can
abrogate the fibrotic response in mouse and human fibrotic fibroblasts or other cell types. In Aim2, we will test
the role of Wnts and its new candidate effector, Dipeptidyl dipeptidase 4 in stimulating lipolysis in chemical and
genetic models in vivo and in vitro. Results from these studies will provide a role for dermal adipocyte derived
fatty acids and Wnt signaling targets as new therapeutic targets in chronic skin fibrosis and associated
lipodystrophy.
Impact: We propose to study the function of adipocyte lipids and Wnt signaling induced lipolysis in context of
dermal fibrosis. These results will reveal novel cell types and molecular pathways involved in lipid depletion
that can be a key regulator of fibrosis development and reversal. Results from these experiments will elucidate
the contribution of intradermal adipocytes and lipolysis as new participants and will change the field by opening
new lines of inquiry and therapeutic targets."

social role statuses and transitions; (e) health, social, and achievement consequences; and (f) risk and protective
behaviors related to the spread of HIV/AIDS. The cohort-sequential longitudinal design permits the
measurement of factors that may explain historical trends and cohort differences. MTF Panel is designed to
document the developmental course of drug use and related attitudes from adolescence through adulthood (ages
18-65), and to determine the predictors and consequences of drug use across the life course. Research on risk
and protective behaviors for the transmission of HIV/AIDS will be a focus, extending the age of monitoring to
those aged 19 to 30. Substance use by college status will continue to be tracked, totaling 45 years of annual trend
data comparing college students and non-college young adults in the U.S. The long-term follow-up will now
include data at age 65 among cohorts who were in high school during historic peaks in teen substance use and
are now facing declining health decades later. Results will continue to elucidate drug use from adolescence
through adulthood—including the use of new drugs and modalities—with important implications for national
policy, research, prevention, and treatment agendas. As our nation sees increases in adolescent and adult vaping
and marijuana use, the need to understand trends in use from adolescence to adulthood and consequences on

10809058,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nurse staffing – registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and certified nurses’ assistants – have long
been considered an important factor determining the quality of care that nursing home residents receive and
their health outcomes. Information about nurse staffing levels are included in Nursing Home Compare (NHC),
the report card published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as one of the three 5 Star
sub-measures, as well as the overall 5-Star measure. Many states and the Federal Government have
established minimum staffing standards for nursing homes. These attest to the importance that policy makers,
experts, advocates, and residents place on staffing, as both determinants and indicators of quality.
 With the increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD), nursing homes are
facing an increasing population of residents with dementia (RWD). These residents are expected to require
even higher staffing levels, compared with residents without ADRD. Yet, the information about, and our
understanding of the needs for staffing other than nursing, such as therapists and social workers, and
specifically how nurse staffing and other professional staff influence health outcomes for RWD is lacking. The
objective of this proposal is 1) to address this gap in knowledge; and 2) to assess the impact of the projected
increase in RWD in nursing homes on workforce requirements. This has been identified as an important policy
objective, as indicated in the National Institute on Aging’s Research Milestone 13.J.
 The specific aims of the application are: 1) To apply econometric techniques to administrative data to
estimate the effects of short- and long-term variations in nursing, therapy and social work staffing levels to
several short- and long-term outcome measures for nursing homes treating a small percent and a large
percent of RWD, and to assess the incremental staffing requirement by staff type and health outcome required
in nursing homes with a high population of RWD compared with nursing homes with a low population of RWD;
2) To determine the implications of the findings for nursing homes and for local, state and national labor
markets based on projected prevalence of RWD in nursing homes; and 3) To develop a web-based application
for policy and decision makers based on our findings, which would allow them to test the impact of different
ADRD and RWD growth scenarios and staffing standards policies on workforce predictions at the nursing
home and market level."
10809060,"Opioid use has increased dramatically in recent years, with rates especially high among women living
in poverty. Maternal opioid use combined with poverty renders children highly vulnerable to a host of
short- and long-term challenges developing self-regulatory capabilities. In infancy, challenges in self-
regulation can be seen in problems in the regulation of attachment behaviors, autonomic nervous
system activity, and production of steroid hormones. Sensitive parenting is especially important for
such children. Without intervention, many children born to opioid dependent mothers are unlikely to
receive sensitive parenting. Early intervention is needed that helps these mothers provide sensitive
care despite the challenges of substance use. In this project, we will assess the efficacy of a home
visiting program adapted for mothers with opioid dependence who are living in poverty. Mothers on
medication assisted treatment for opioid dependence during their third trimester of pregnancy will be
randomized to this adapted home visiting program, modified Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up
(mABC: N=100), or to a control condition of the same duration and frequency (modified
Developmental education for Families, or mDEF: N=100). We will assess whether the mABC
intervention engages the purported treatment mechanism, maternal sensitivity. Second, we examine
whether the intervention has positive effects on infants’ regulation of cortisol production, autonomic
nervous system activity, and attachment. Third, we examine whether maternal sensitivity mediates
intervention effects on infant outcomes. An exploratory aim examines whether the intervention alters
maternal neural activity related to the rewarding nature of babies versus drugs. Parental sensitivity
will be assessed prenatally, and at infant ages of 1 week, and 3, 6, and 12 months of age, and
maternal neural activity will be assessed prenatally and at infant age of 12 months. Infant cortisol will
be assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, autonomic nervous system regulation at 6 and 12 months of
age, and attachment at 12 months. The mABC intervention is expected to affect child behavioral and
biological outcomes with these effects mediated by maternal sensitivity."

The aim of this proposal is to enhance the technical development of an open MRI system that can be
integrated into an exam table in a doctor's office, allowing MRI scans to be used similarly to ultrasound. This
open-low-field MRI is silent and can produce high-quality images of any organ with the patient lying flat on the
examination bed or standing for weighted spine or limb imaging with the device wall-mounted. Developing a
small-footprint compact and low-cost MRI system allows MRI to be moved from hospitals to doctors' offices,
with the impact that MRI could become more accessible to a wider population.
This proposal combines developments in MR imaging with non-linear gradients, field-cycling MRI, spatial
encoding using RF, and non-Fourier based algebraic reconstruction techniques incorporating parallel imaging.
The objective is to enhance the image quality through innovative developments in both spatial encoding and
pulse sequences. The preliminary data indicates strong signal, prolonged T2s, and exceptional image quality.
Aims 1 and 2 integrate and optimize new encoding developments through novel RF coil designs, stop-motion
imaging, and the introduction of gradient encoding to the system. The goal of these studies is to optimize
resolution across the targeted volume (24x24x20cm). The proposal also introduces new pulse sequences with
an emphasis on fat/water separation and quantification. Aim 3 tests three forms of fat-water contrast
manipulation and gathers preliminary data on the effectiveness of this device for assessing fatty liver disease
in both lean and obese subjects.
Together, these aims will establish the imaging capabilities of the device, which would be a significant step
forward on the path to improved accessibility. This proposal is innovative as it combines several proven
technologies in novel ways to develop a new class of low-cost MRI devices that operate in inhomogeneous B0
fields."

Overview: Reproduction relies on a complex series of cell fate decisions, cell cycle transitions, 
and differentiation events, which coordinate the formation and function of gametes with 
the process of meiosis. A century of research using many experimental organisms, 
including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, defined key intercellular signals regulating 
germline development, delineated central players in meiosis, and revealed the importance of 
post-transcriptional gene regulatory mechanisms. Yet, important mechanistic questions remain about 
how intercellular communication integrates the underlying molecular mechanisms into a coherent 
germline developmental program. This research proposal addresses several central questions:
•How do soma-germline gap junctions orchestrate germline development, coordinate 
germline developmental subroutines, and integrate nutritional signals to optimize reproduction?
•How do intercellular signals and gametic interactions regulate protein translation to enable 
fertilization and ensure the vitality of the embryo?
•Can we exploit the dynamic nature of germline development in which germ cell nuclei move within 
the gonadal tube to provide broad insights into the cell biology of diseases affecting the nuclear 
envelope?
Goals: The chief goal of our work is to delineate the regulatory networks governing conserved and 
essential steps in germline development. Our focus will be on three areas: (1) The role of gap 
junctions in controlling soma-germline interactions; (2) The regulation of protein 
translation by intercellular signaling during oocyte meiotic maturation and the 
oocyte-to-embryo transition; and (3) Studies in the C. elegans germline system that provide 
insights into the cell biology of a class of human diseases affecting the nuclear envelope. In 
pursuing these goals, we will fill three key gaps in understanding: (i) the nature of the active 
biomolecules that transit through gap junctions to mediate their many essential reproductive 
functions; (ii) the function and regulation of a large translational regulatory machine that lies 
at the heart of the oocyte meiotic maturation decision and the oocyte-to-embryo transition; and 
(iii) the involvement of nuclear mechanotransduction and endogenous mechanical forces in the 
origin of diseases affecting the nuclear envelope.
Vision: Using the powerful combination of genetic and modern molecular technologies available in C. 
elegans, we will advance our understanding of germline development, germline stem cell behavior, 
and oogenesis. In the course of these investigations, we will discover new molecular principles 
vital to human health and inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to treat disease. 
This fundamental research in a genetic model system will generate foundational knowledge for 
understanding reproduction and the origin of birth defects."

Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects rural Hispanic populations in the US. Although the prevalence of
diabetes is higher in rural Hispanics than in non-Hispanic Whites, rural Hispanics have limited access to
evidence-based diabetes preventive services. Hispanics are less likely to receive diabetes preventive
screening, advice and referrals recommended by the US Preventive Service Task Force than any other group.
Aside from socioeconomic and language barriers, a main problem is reaching this vulnerable population with
culturally appropriate preventive interventions. Mobile health units could help better reach rural Hispanics; they
have been found to increase healthcare access for minoritized populations, serve as links between community
and clinical settings, and contribute to the initiation of preventive interventions. However, mobile health units
face challenges related to the cost of motor vehicles, lack of community participation, and lack of relevance to
rural Hispanics. To address these limitations, we propose to use implementation research and community-
engagement to co-design and pilot-test a health unit that provides guideline-recommended diabetes preventive
services (i.e., screening, counseling, and referrals) for Hispanics living in rural Indiana. The study will be
guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment Framework to complete the following
specific aims: 1) Prototype a health unit model to deliver diabetes preventive services through a process of co-
creation, community feedback, and iterative design, and 2) Determine the reach, feasibility, and
implementation of the health units among Hispanics in rural Indiana. A structured participatory process
following human centered design methods will be used to engage community stakeholders in the design of the
health units and the implementation plan, which will increase the likelihood of success and potential for scale.
By bringing evidence-based diabetes preventive services to the places where minoritized communities live, our
health unit model has the potential to ameliorate the access disparities rural Hispanics face. This application
aligns with NIDDK’s research priorities and strategic mission to address diabetes disparities and will provide
data to inform intervention content, sampling and measurement for a subsequent study to test the
effectiveness and implementation the health unit model."

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH), as defined by the disproportionate representation of hematopoietic clones with
somatic mutations, is highly prevalent in the elderly. CH confers a risk of progression to malignancy and has
been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.
We are interested in studying CH specifically in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation
(HCT). Due to the increasing number of aging recipients and related donors, CH in donor samples is becoming
increasingly likely. Previous studies have implicated donor CH in donor cell leukemias and an increased risk of
unexplained cytopenias and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and have shown preferential expansion of CH
clones post-transplant. Paradoxically, donor CH has also been associated with reduced risk of relapse. Post-
transplant, donor CH clones are under particular stress due to their rapid self-renewal and the inflammatory bone
marrow microenvironment. However, little is known about the clonal dynamics and evolution that occurs in the
bone marrow post-transplant and how they relate to the reported outcomes. Additionally, it is not clear how CH
clones represented in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations compared to differentiated cells.
In this project we propose to define the clonal dynamics and evolution post-allogeneic HCT at the single cell
level. Our goal is to understand the interactions between the donor and recipient clones, how they develop and
distribute across hematopoietic lineages, and how donor CH clones affect these processes. To achieve this goal,
we will utilize longitudinal bone marrow samples from HCT recipients collected in the first two years post-
transplant. We will apply a new high-throughput single cell system that allows for simultaneous genotypic and
phenotypic information for each cell. Using this information, we will be able to track the evolution, expansion,
and lineage distribution of each clone, and examine the role of pre-existing donor CH clones on this process.
Additionally, we will compare the clonal architectures of the bone marrow HSC population with that of total
peripheral blood to identify clones that are preferentially found in HSCs and track their emergence in mature
blood cells. Overall, this project will provide a greater understanding of the risks in donor CH and what drives
these risks. The insights we gain will also be valuable in understanding stem cell subclonal dynamics and
competition under stress conditions and leukemic progression in general."

 Children who survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) have high rates of disability and substantial
caregiver burden 1-year after arrest, yet little is known about longer term child function, caregiver burden, or
the factors influencing these outcomes. Prior studies of outcomes more than 1-year after OHCA used
small/single-site samples, included only children presenting for clinical follow-up, or combined children with
OHCA with those with in-hospital arrest despite very different characteristics. Our team capitalized on the first
major multi-center clinical trial for children with OHCA (THAPCA-OH, 2009-2012) to yield the most detailed
data on 1-year adaptive functioning outcomes. One year after OHCA, child functioning was divided across 3
disability levels (1/3 with no disability, 1/3 with mild/moderate disability, 1/3 with severe disability). Family
burden was high in this cohort and associated with greater child disability. Almost a third of these children were
<3 years of age (and >60% were <6 years of age) at the 1-year follow-up, and thus it remains unknown how
these children will present at school age and later when additional cognitive and functional skills are expected
to be present. We now have the unique opportunity to capitalize on the NHLBI/NINDS funded P-ICECAP
(Pediatric Influence of Cooling duration on Efficacy in Cardiac Arrest Patients; NIH
UH3HL159134/U24HL159132) which aims to identify the shortest cooling duration that provides the best 1-
year outcome for survival and neurobehavioral function. P-ICECAP will enroll up to 900 children after OHCA
with an expected 450 survivors with a wide range of outcomes. We propose this ancillary study to build upon
P-ICECAP. Our overall objectives are to determine long-term adaptive functioning and neuropsychological
performance in children and caregiver/family burden after pediatric OHCA and to identify risk/protective factors
that could lead to interventions to promote improved outcomes. The aims are to 1a) detect trajectories in
adaptive functioning from 3 months to 4 years after OHCA; 1b) detect neurocognitive impairments 2 to 4 years
after OHCA in children >6 years of age at follow-up; 2) identify predictors of better child adaptive functioning 2
and 4 years after OHCA based on level of child disability at 1-year; 3) identify predictors of lower
caregiver/family burden at 2 and 4 years after OHCA based on level of child disability at 1-year. We will enroll
350 participants after the 1-year P-ICECAP follow-up is complete and collect data centrally at Kennedy Krieger
Institute via electronic interim surveys and 2- and 4-year telephone interviews. The subset of children >6 years
with functional communication will participate in centralized, virtual neuropsychological evaluation."

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most deleterious lesions. The cellular responses to DSBs
involve a sophisticated DNA damage response network that detects, signals and repairs the lesion; failure of
this system results in mutation, deletion and other alteration of genome and underlies many diseases. Post-
translational modifications by covalent attachment of ubiquitin to proteins, known as ubiquitination, play
important regulatory roles in the DNA damage response. Previous studies, including ours, have illustrated that,
upon DSBs detection and activation of the DNA damage response kinase ATM, Lys63-linked ubiquitination of
histone H2A/H2AX on damaged chromatin is critical in recruiting DNA damage repair proteins, including
53BP1 and BRCA1, to the damage sites. However, much remains unknown about the complexity of ubiquitin
modifications and their roles in the DNA damage response. We have discovered that Lys11-linkage–specific
ubiquitin modification occurs on damaged chromatin that regulates repression of transcription at DSBs,
revealing Lys11-linkage ubiquitin modification as a new signaling and regulatory platform in the response to
DSBs. We further showed that this modification is ATM dependent and catalyzed by RNF8 and Ube2S. In
addition, cells deficient in Lys11-linkage ubiquitin modification displayed increased sensitivity to ionizing
radiation. It indicates a model that DNA repair and transcription can be regulated by distinct linkage-specific
ubiquitin modifications at DSBs. However, it is not clear whether these two seemingly parallel linkage-specific
ubiquitination pathways are coordinated to regulate DNA repair and transcription in the cellular responses to
DSBs. The objective of this proposal is to identify the crosstalk between Lys63- and Lys11-linkage modification
on damaged chromatin and determine the underlying mechanisms through which it coordinates transcriptional
repression and DNA repair. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) determine the crosstalk between
Lys11- and Lys63-linkage ubiquitination mediated by Cezanne to regulate DNA repair; 2) determine additional
mechanisms underlying the coordination of DNA repair and transcriptional inhibition; 3) determine the role of
Lys11- and Lys63-linkage ubiquitination at defined DSB sites in regulating DNA repair and inhibition of
transcription. Our findings should provide novel insights into the understanding of how ubiquitin modification at
DSBs is involved in signaling events to regulate inhibition of transcription and repair. Our long-term goal is to
decipher the complex DNA response network that protects genome integrity, which is essential for design of
tools and treatment to improve human health."

from as early as 2005 to find that a majority pursued college education with a science emphasis, and many
also sought post-graduate training and terminal degrees. Pacific STEP-UP remains the only formalized hands-
on research training program for high schools in the US Pacific, amid the urgent need to build and foster a
pipeline of underrepresented individuals seeking health research careers in order to combat health disparity in
this region of the world. With confidence that Pacific STEP-UP has established roots in the region, we will
continue our research training and mentoring program but charting a new course under framework of One
Health. The new strategy and approach in research training, mentoring, and in capacity building will further
NIDDK STEP-UP’s reach into the Pacific communities by bringing awareness of the interdependency of the
well beings of humans, animals, and the eco-environment; and its impact on health-related issues. The goal is
to seed and shape a culture that values One Health research as the means to address pertinent health issues
in these communities, and grow a cadre of “home-grown” scientists readied to research for solutions. In doing
so, we will fulfill NIDDK’s STEP-UP mission to build and diversify a pipeline of future scientists interested in
tackling health and disease questions related to NIDDK from multiple angles of trans-sectorial and trans-
disciplinary approach under One Health. Accordingly, we propose three Specific Aims. (1). Recruit best
qualified high school students (11th and 12th grade) from the seven US State and Territories in the Pacific into
the STEP-UP Summer Research Program, and track the cohort’s academic progress for a minimum of 5
years. (2). Provide individualized research experience (and related education and training) that stresses One
Health approach, and local community or population relevance. Provide STEP-UP alumni with follow up, and
research-focused, mentoring extending for 9 months. (3). Seed and nurture interests in One Health in high
school students while strengthening local colleges’ capacity to enable laboratory-, field-, and community-based
research with a focus on One Health concepts, all in support of the Pacific STEP-UP program by expanding
application pool and research opportunities, and strengthening the research training program."

Health literacy refers to the skills needed to effectively access, understand, and use health resources.
Inadequate health literacy annually costs the U.S. $100-$200 billion and is observed among justice involved
adults (JIA)—a group of ~20 million U.S. persons who are disproportionately non-elderly and African American,
Black, and Hispanic due to systemic racism and over-policing. JIA face numerous barriers in accessing
healthcare which contributes to a high, lifelong burden of chronic and infectious disease. Healthcare access is
defined as 1) having health insurance coverage, 2) having a regular source of care and 3) obtaining healthcare
in a timely manner. Health literacy interventions for JIA are critically needed but are unavailable and NIH-
funded research that is inclusive of JIA is sorely lacking. This timely study addresses these gaps. We have
obtained promising results from a pilot study of a novel intervention that seeks to build JIA’s health literacy and
improve their healthcare access. Therefore, we propose to implement a longitudinal mixed-methods
randomized clinical trial (RCT) to assess the impact of the UCSD RELINK coach-guided health literacy
intervention vs. a self-study control group on JIA’s healthcare access. To achieve this aim, 300 JIA ages 18-50
will be recruited in San Diego, CA and randomized 1:1 to the Treatment Group (i.e., coach-guided health
literacy intervention) or the Control Group (i.e., self-study of the intervention). Researchers will assess JIA’s
use of healthcare within 6 months at 6-month follow-up as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include
assessing maintenance of healthcare access at 12-month follow-up. We hypothesize that participants in the
Treatment Arm will exhibit improvements in all healthcare access measures as compared to Control Group
participants (Aim 1) and specifically, that they will be more likely to report healthcare use within 6 months than
the control group. For Aim 2, we will conduct longitudinal individual interviews at 6- and 12-months to assess
JIA’s satisfaction with the intervention; healthcare attitudes, self-efficacy for healthcare use; factors impacting
maintenance of healthcare access over time; perceived contribution of the intervention to health and well-
being; and diffusion of the intervention to JIA’s social contacts. To achieve this aim, we will conduct semi-
structured qualitative interviews with 40 purposively sampled participants (20 per intervention arm) who
reported healthcare access barriers at baseline. This study is timely and may inform health literacy
interventions for JIA, policies to build health literacy among JIA in institutional and community settings, and the
service delivery models for JIA. The proposed intervention has great potential for increasing health literacy
among JIA and thus improving the well-being of this sizeable and underserved community. Findings from this
study may also have relevance for interventions seeking to build the health literacy of other low-income
communities."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has a complex neuropathology involving progressive alterations in brain centers
that process cognitive and emotional behaviors and consist of heterogeneous cell populations. The complex
spatiotemporal cell and molecular circuits underlying progressive TBI pathologies that can evolve into other
disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and posttraumatic stress disorder remain to be
understood. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the complexity of TBI
has been hindered by the lack of effective approaches to examine molecular events in individual brain cells
that drive the overall pathology. We recently conducted a single cell resolution study of the hippocampus at the
acute phase (24hr) of TBI using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and revealed cell-type specific
pathways and regulators of TBI. In particular, we found that depression of cell metabolism to be a key
pathogenic component in the hippocampus at the acute phase of TBI. This finding suggests that tracking
metabolic state of cells can be used to address key knowledge gaps on the spatial and time dependent
progression of key pathologic drivers of TBI. Here we propose to test the hypothesis that cell metabolic
regulators determine dynamic and spatial pathogenic pathways of TBI by harnessing the power of modern
high-throughput technologies. We propose a highly integrative team approach to profit from recent advances in
single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and multiplexed error robust fluorescent in situ hybridization
(MERFISH) along with advanced gene-gene and cell-cell network modeling to inform on targets for intervention
at specific time points or brain sites, a fundamental unsolved question in the TBI field. In Aim 1, we propose to
utilize a unique combination of scRNAseq, MERFISH, and network modeling approaches to assess and
validate the spatial and temporal vulnerability of each cell type to TBI in multiple brain regions at multiple time
points in a data-driven, unbiased manner, which can inform us about hidden regulators of TBI pathogenesis.
We will focus on the spatial and temporal changes in cellular metabolic pathways during TBI progression. Our
preliminary results support that mt-Rnr2, encoding a mitochondrial peptide humanin and involved in cell
metabolism, is a major site- and time-dependent driver of TBI. In Aim 2, we will functionally assess whether
modulating mt-Rnr2 (humanin) has therapeutic potential to mitigate TBI pathology and prevent progression.
We will also explore the cell-type specific mechanisms, especially the role of metabolism, underlying the
actions of humanin. The overall goal of the proposal is to elaborate on an innovative strategy that can offer a
comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the spatiotemporal cell substrates of TBI pathology and uncover
novel targets and mechanisms to redirect the courses of TBI to overcome subsequent neurological disorders."
10817750,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use has been identified as a major risk factor for the global burden of death, disease and
injury. Given the high levels of overall volume of alcohol use, detrimental drinking patterns, and high
levels of alcohol-attributable mortality and burden of disease, Lithuania recently implemented three of
the most effective alcohol control policies within a short time span: increase in taxation, reduction of
availability of alcoholic beverages, and a ban on advertisement. For the first time ever, the
implementation of these three best practices in alcohol control policy allows for an evaluation of their
combined effect on total amount of alcohol consumed, as well as alcohol-attributable hospitalizations,
deaths and violence in the subpopulations targeted by these policies. It also allows for a
comprehensive economic evaluation of the return on investment – that is, a comparison of the cost of
implementation and the economic benefits due to a reduction in alcohol-attributable hospitalizations,
deaths and violence – which has never been done before. Accordingly, the proposed study intends
to measure the effectiveness and economic gains of the interventions implemented in Lithuania, and
to compare Lithuania to two other Baltic countries (Estonia and Latvia) to ensure that any changes
observed within the country were not part of any regional trends that were independent of the
interventions. The proposed study will use a mix of different quantitative and qualitative methods,
based on high-quality data. Not only is this the first time that the three most effective alcohol control
policies have been implemented almost simultaneously, but, given the characteristics of Lithuania,
the effects of such interventions can be generalized to other high-income countries, such as the
United States. What we learn from the proposed study will inform and enhance our ability to prevent
alcohol-attributable deaths, diseases and injuries in the United States, including but not limited to the
so-called deaths of despair (i.e., liver cirrhosis, suicide and poisoning). The proposed proposal
involves a number of decision-makers and alcohol policy stakeholders, who will be intricately involved
in the interpretation, publishing and publicizing the findings."
10817753,"Negative regulators of endothelial regeneration in aging lungs and ARDS
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a complex, multi-factorial syndrome with a mortality rate as
great as 30-40%. A fundamental pathological change found in ARDS that results from sepsis, and pneumonia
is injury to the endothelial barrier, and, as a result, increased lung vascular permeability and intractable protein-
rich edema. Compared to young adult patients, the incidence of ARDS resulting from sepsis and pneumonia
in elderly patients is much higher and the mortality rate is 10-fold higher. However, the underlying causes of
aging-related high incidence and mortality of ARDS are poorly understood. There is no effective treatment of
ARDS. Employing genetic lineage tracing, our Supporting Data show that the endogenous endothelial
regeneration program was severely impaired in aged lungs following sepsis challenge, and restoration of
FOXM1 expression could normalize this regenerative and reparative program. Furthermore, our Supporting
Data show that FOXO1 is a suppressor of FOXM1 expression in aged lungs. Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) functions as an
aging-regulated epigenetic regulator of FOXO1. Thus, we hypothesize that epigenetic dysregulation of
endothelial FOXO1→FOXM1 expression by SIRT1 in aged lungs is responsible for the impaired endothelial
regeneration and vascular repair and thereby reactivation of the FOXM1-dependent regenerative and
reparative pathway through EC-targeted nanoparticle delivery of FOXM1 transgene may represent a novel
therapeutic approach for restoring lung microvessel integrity and resolving inflammatory edema and thus
improving survival of elderly ARDS patients. The proposed studies will address the following three Specific
Aims. Studies in Aim1 will determine the role of endothelial FoxO1 in regulating endothelial regeneration and
vascular repair in aged lungs following sepsis challenge and define FOXO1 as a transcriptional repressor of
FOXM1 in endothelial cells. In Aim 2, we will define the epigenetic mechanism of aging activation of FOXO1
via SIRT1. We will characterize the unexpected role of endothelial SIRT1 in inhibiting endothelial regeneration
and resolution of inflammatory injury in aged lungs through FOXO1-mediated suppression of FOXM1
expression. Studies in Aim 3 will develop novel biodegradable nanoparticles for endothelial delivery of FOXM1
transgene in aged lungs. This translational aim will explore the potential of novel nanoparticle delivery of
FOXM1 as an EC-targeted gene therapy approach for treatment of ARDS in elderly patients. Successful
completion of the proposed studies will provide novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms of impaired
endothelial regeneration and vascular repair and thus high incidence and mortality of ARDS in elderly patients
and provide fundamentally important preclinical data needed for future clinical and commercial translation of
our discovery into ARDS therapy in elderly patients. Thus, the translation potential of the proposed studies is
extremely high."

The overarching goal of our research program is to discover why some people age earlier and faster than
others, and what might be done to prevent this. Increasingly, prevention-minded gerontologists and
geroscientists look to midlife as the life stage offering a propitious opportunity to prevent or delay the multiple
diseases that shrink older adults’ health span. But because most studies of aging have enrolled participants
well past midlife, and most studies of younger adults have not measured aging as a process of change over
time, there is surprisingly little basic knowledge about aging during midlife. Our research program uniquely fills
this gap. This is a competing renewal proposal to follow up at age 52 a cohort of all 1037 infants born in one
city in one year and exhaustively studied ever since: the Dunedin Longitudinal Study. Some cohort members
are becoming biologically older than their peers as they pass through midlife, others remain biologically
younger. The proposed follow-up will allow us to quantify how fast or slowly each cohort member is aging in
each of 8 different domains: the pace of biological aging, functional aging, facial aging, social aging, sexual
aging, inflammatory aging, microvascular aging, and cognitive aging (Aim 1A). These 8 domains are typically
studied by different scientific disciplines in silos, but we will study them together in one cohort to attract
scientific recognition to the great heterogeneity within the whole-person experience of aging. We will develop
a measure of each of the 8 kinds of aging, by modelling 3 or more waves of data on each. Three data waves
are the minimum requirement to disentangle each person’s decline (aging-related decline, how people have
changed; their slope) from their level (initial health, where people started; their intercept). Studies with fewer
than 3 waves conflate decline over the years (aging) with low scores present since earlier life (not aging). The
proposed follow-up at age 52 is necessary to add the essential 3rd midlife wave for this cohort of participants.
This follow-up will create an unprecedented unique dataset. To amplify scientific progress, we will deliver to the
research community a reliable, valid, open-access DNA-methylation version of each of the 8 new measures of
how rapidly a person has been aging (Aim 1B). To evaluate generalizability of findings for under-represented
ethnic-groups, we will export the 8 new DNA-methylation measures to Black and Latinx cohorts with
methylation, where we have established collaborations to study the pace of aging. We will further generate
new knowledge about the early-life antecedents of each kind of aging (Aim 2). We will also generate new
knowledge about the risk each of the 8 kinds of aging poses for late-life disease (Aim 3). This involves testing
the hypothesis that fast-aging individuals show compromised capacity at age 52 to mount a healthy immune
response in vitro. It also involves testing the hypothesis that fast-aging individuals have elevated scores at age
52 on blood biomarkers for Alzheimers disease."

Nationally, South Carolina (SC) ranks among the worst for poor pregnancy outcomes and high maternal and
infant mortality rates, with vast racial/ethnic disparities present. Infection with the novel SARS-CoV-2 during
pregnancy has been associated with pregnancy complications and poor infant and maternal outcomes including
mortality. Moreover, the effect of social determinants and inequities in healthcare received and health outcomes
have been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2. Cardiovascular risk factors during
pregnancy (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) and pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia are
common, can result in morbidity and mortality for the mother and the baby, and are well-known risk factors for
maternal cardiovascular and vascular disease short and long-term. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 during pregnancy
has also been related to complications (e.g., intensive care unit (ICU) admission, invasive ventilation, myocardial
infarction, embolism). Less information is available regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or
specifically SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal and infant morbidity and mortality. The objective of our study is
to understand the impact of both the COVID-19 pandemic and infection with SARS-CoV-2 on the risk of maternal
and infant morbidity and mortality including pregnancy complications (e.g., pre-eclampsia, ICU admissions,
mechanical ventilation), adverse birth outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, small for gestational age), and maternal
cardiovascular events (e.g., coronary heart disease, stroke, embolism) during and post-pregnancy. Data from
statewide administrative datasets (e.g., hospitalizations, vital records, Medicaid, positive COVID-19 tests) will be
linked to create a diverse, longitudinal cohort of women who gave birth between 2018-2021 with at least one
year of follow-up through 2022. Approximately 45,000 live birth pregnancies take place in SC each year for a
total of ~180,000 deliveries anticipated over the 4-year study period. As of June 1, 2021, 2600 pregnant women
in SC were diagnosed with COVID-19. The proposed project aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic (Aim 1) and the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Aim 2) at the population level in SC on (1) pregnancy
complications, adverse birth outcomes, maternal cardiovascular events, and maternal and infant mortality; (2)
maternal one-year post pregnancy cardiovascular and mortality outcomes; and (3) to examine differences by
race/ethnicity, social vulnerability, distance to main medical facility, and pre-pregnancy obesity and diabetes.
This study will be among the first to evaluate the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 infection during
pregnancy in relation to maternal and infant morbidity and mortality in a population-based study. Determining
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 infection on infant and maternal morbidity and mortality

Loss of vision due to optic neuropathies, like glaucoma, is a common cause of blindness in the United States.
Unfortunately, these conditions are usually permanent because the central nervous system lacks the ability to
regenerate damaged axons. Mammalian models of optic nerve (ON) injury recapitulate the pathology seen in
patients making it difficult to understand what is needed for successful regeneration. In contrast, teleost fish,
such as the zebrafish, can successfully regenerate damage to the ON and recover lost vision. We are using this
organism to study the mechanisms of successful ON regeneration with the hopes of translating these findings
into novel therapeutics to improve regeneration in mammalian disease models and patients. In a transcriptome-
wide study of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) during zebrafish ON regeneration we identified the mevalonate and
cholesterol pathways as up regulated during this process. Our preliminary data suggests the master
transcriptional regulator of these pathways, srebf2, is necessary for successful ON regeneration. We hypothesize
that srebf2 mediates ON regeneration by activating the RGC intrinsic mevalonate and cholesterol synthesis
pathway and/or inducing expression of receptors for extracellular sources of cholesterol and lipids. Using the
powerful genetic and chemical tools available for the zebrafish system, we propose to identify the critical period
of srebf2 activity and the downstream mediator(s) of its function. Aim 1 will determine when srebf2 function in
RGCs is critical for ON regeneration and using novel reporter lines of srebf2 activity to delineate when
transcriptional activity occurs. We will also test if activation of srebf2 activity is sufficient to accelerate ON
regeneration. Lastly, we will use laser capture microdissection RNA-seq (LCM-seq) to identify differential gene
expression under gain- and loss-of-srebf2 function in RGCs. Aim 2 proposes to identify which RGC intrinsic or
extrinsic pathways downstream of srebf2 mediate its function. We will use combinations of drugs and gene
knockdown to determine if intrinsic mevalonate/cholesterol synthesis and external supplies are independent,
interdependent, and/or compensatory for successful ON regeneration. Depending upon the results of this study
we will further examine the downstream intrinsic synthesis pathways for cholesterol, ubiquinone, protein
prenylation, and protein N-glycosylation or low-density lipoprotein receptors and their downstream processing.
Aim 3 will test the sufficiency of Srebf2 expression to provide neuroprotection and stimulate axon regeneration
in a mouse model of acute ON injury. LCM-seq will be used to identify gene expression changes induced in
mouse RGCs by Srebf2 and compared to those identified in zebrafish to suggest mechanisms for success or
failure. These experiments will delineate the pathways downstream of srebf2 necessary for efficient ON
regeneration and suggest paths forward to enhance mammalian regeneration."

 Telomere-associated diseases, including telomere biology disorders (TBD), are prevalent
among the aging population. TBD represent a group of most common premature aging syndromes,
including dyskeratosis congenita (DC), aplastic anemia, and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), etc.
The diagnosis of TBDs can be challenge due to the variable, complex, and time-dependent nature of
clinical manifestations. Genetic testing may be inconclusive because a significant portion of patients
do not have an identifiable genetic cause. Telomere length testing has been shown to aid in DC
diagnostics. However, a low-cost and accurate telomere length test is not available as a first line
diagnostic or screening tool for the early detection of TBDs and other telomere-associated diseases.
 We propose to develop a DNA array and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)-based method
to measure the absolute lengths of individual telomeres. The goal is to develop a low-cost, accurate,
and high-throughput telomere test that uses a small amount of DNA, thus the test will be applicable to
any cell/tissue type which DNA can be extracted from. This next-generation telomere test not only
measures average telomere length, but also telomere length distribution, thus providing a detailed
telomere length profile for a patient. We anticipate that additional details in telomere length
distribution will enhance the diagnostic accuracy of telomere-associated diseases because it is well
documented that accumulation of critically short telomeres during aging or by environmental assaults
is responsible for the telomere-driven pathologies. In this phase I study, we propose the following two
aims: 1) validate the optimized experimental conditions for accuracy in the measurement of telomere
length; 2) determine the impact of DNA extraction methods on telomere length measurement.
 Phase I aims will lay the foundation for the Phase II study which will establish a new, accurate,
low-cost, and high-throughput telomere length assay and generate a marketable telomere diagnostic
test to enhance the diagnosis and management of telomere-associated diseases. Given the rapid
increase in the aging population and the relevance of telomere biology in human aging-related
diseases, we anticipate the potential market for the test will be large."

Career Goal. My long-term career goals are: (1) to obtain and secure a full-time tenure track appointment; and
(2) to become an independently funded community-engaged Latinx public health scientist to address immigrant
health as well as substance use/HIV risk in Latinx populations. This research and training grant will provide me
with the opportunity to fortify my research skills as a postdoctoral fellow at FIU to successfully transition to a
prevention intervention scientist that addresses prominent health inequalities faced by stimulant-using LMSM.
Career Development. This K99/R00 research and training plan will catalyze my efforts to acquire the advanced
training necessary to develop and test culturally informed behavioral interventions addressing the intersection of
stimulant use and HIV risk in LMSM. During the K99 phase, my training goals consist of (1) developing advanced
competencies in designing culturally informed evidence-based interventions;(2) pursuing advanced training in
Randomize Control Trial methods necessary to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of
a culturally informed behavioral intervention and (3) acquire knowledge in the application of SNA methods to
assess the effects of a culturally informed behavioral intervention on participant's social network composition.
Research Project. Latinx communities are the fastest-growing group in the US.24 LMSM (foreign and US-born)
are disproportionately affected by HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. The K99/R00 proposal will focus
on this underserved population of stimulant-using LMSM who are in desperate need of culturally informed
interventions to mitigate co-occurring stimulant use and HIV risk in the era of PrEP. Developing a behavioral
intervention that addresses cultural factors and social networks as key determinants of stimulant use and HIV
risk in LMSM represents a viable strategy to reduce stimulant use, decrease engagement in condomless anal
sex (CAS), and support PrEP uptake in LMSM. Specific Aims. (1) Conduct formative research through mixed
methods to develop a culturally informed intervention targeting co-occurring stimulant use and HIV risk in LMSM
who are not on PrEP and (2) Conduct a pilot Randomize Control Trial to test the feasibility, acceptability and
preliminary efficacy of a culturally informed intervention for optimizing PrEP uptake as the primary outcome with
60 stimulant-using LMSM. Mentorship Team: My efforts will be guided by an accomplished, interdisciplinary
team of mentors committed to support my transition to an independent investigator."
10817686,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Objectives: Developmental scientists frequently employ the Violation of Expectation (VOE) paradigm to
investigate two areas of infant development: cognitive and social-emotional. Cognitive scientists find that
infants look at VOEs, while social-emotional researchers find infants smile at VOEs. In addition to conflicting,
these findings remain siloed. The two sides also employ different methods suggesting the findings may be
methodological artifacts: cognitive researchers present infants with VOEs in which objects appear to behave by
themselves, while social-emotion researchers present infants with VOEs in which agents behave with objects.
The former may restrict infants to looking simply because the events are out of the range of typical perceptual
experience, yet have led to the inference that infants have an innate sense of natural laws. This project will
merge these lines of inquiry and extend the dependent measures to include behavioral, affective, and
physiological metrics to examine if and how infants distinguish between VOEs, contributing important
knowledge about early cognitive and social capacities. Specifically, the project will present infants with VOEs
from the cognitive literature but presented using the social-emotional protocol that involves social agents
(Specific Aim #1) and repetition (Specific Aim #2), two features that may resolve these problematic
discrepancies and explain how infants make sense of VOEs.
Design and Methods: In experiment #1, 6-month-olds (N=60) will observe two VOEs taken from the
literature (object disappearance & object switch; Baillargeon, 1994a & Dunn & Bremner, 2017, respectively) in
which a familiar object (e.g., ball) appears to behave by itself (asocial) or an agent behaves with the object
(social) in a 2x2 (social/asocial condition x control/VOE event) mixed factorial design. We expect an
interaction effect in which infants exhibit more smiling vs. ,more looking at VOEs performed with or without a
social agent, respectively. In experiment #2, another sample of 6-month-olds (N=60) will observe the same
VOEs and their corresponding control events (within-s’s factor) as described in experiment #1 but be randomly
assigned (between-s’s factor) to single or repeated exposure. We predict more smiling toward VOEs presented
with repetition (experimental), and more looking at VOEs without repetition (control). In both experiments we
expect smaller ratio of looking and larger ratio of smiling in the social/asocial and repetition/single-exposure
conditions, respectively. In both experiments heart rate deceleration is predicted to corroborate visual fixation
to VOEs and mean (beats/minute) HR decreases/RSA increases in conjunction with looking and/or smiling."

10818496,"Clinical Component - Abstract
The goal of the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Digestive Disease Research Core Center (DDRCC)
Clinical Component (CC) is to establish a research support infrastructure of biostatisticians and research
operations to promote the effectiveness of research performed by Center members. This will be accomplished
by supporting the design, implementation and analysis of research studies in digestive and liver diseases that
fall thematically into the DDRCC’s major research priorities.
The CC has several unique features, including an extensive track record of prominent, collaborative research in
digestive and liver diseases, led by Dr. Valerie Durkalski, Professor of Biostatistics and Director of the Data
Coordination Unit (DCU) in the Department of Public Health Sciences at MUSC. Dr. Durkalski and her team are
ideally positioned to fill this role based on their experience as the statistical and data coordinating center for
many NIH-funded multicenter clinical trials and research studies. Further, CC team members are already heavily
involved with Center investigators on a number of NIDDK-funded multicenter studies in gastrointestinal disease.
The CC has two Specific Aims: In Aim 1, the CC will collaborate with DDRCC Biomedical Research Cores and
DDRCC members to support basic, translational and clinical digestive and liver disease research, and to facilitate
the translation of basic research into the clinical setting. The CC members will utilize their expertise in the design
and coordination of digestive disease basic, translational and clinical research studies to collaborate with
DDRCC members in the planning and execution of proposed research projects. In Aim 2, the CC will provide
statistical expertise and support for DDRCC members. The CC will apply their statistical expertise to contribute
to the design of innovative and efficient research studies (basic research studies, clinical trials, translational and
observational studies), analysis and presentation of pilot data, and the development of grant submissions that
will address proposed research questions.
The CC will also foster the professional development of New Investigators. In summary, the CC is ideally poised
to provide a cohesive platform for facilitating the proposed aims and is well-prepared and committed to ensuring
a successful and productive collaboration with the DDRCC Research Cores and members."
10818499,"Pilot & Feasibility Program - Abstract
The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program is an integral component of the Digestive Disease Research Core Center
(DDRCC) and supports the center’s mission to facilitate and promote digestive and liver disease research at the
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). The overall objective of the P&F Program is to provide and
prioritize short-term funding for scientifically meritorious and innovative projects through a competitive program
which incorporates an open solicitation and peer review process. The primary goals of the P&F Program are to:
1) encourage and support promising New Investigators with an interest in digestive disease research to develop
independent research programs; 2) attract accomplished investigators from other fields who would like to apply
their research skills and expertise to a digestive disease-related problem; and 3) enable established investigators
active in digestive disease or related disorders to test the feasibility of a novel idea, particularly if this constitutes
a departure from their current funded research that will likely have a significant impact on the field. The P&F
Program will be an important vehicle for promoting multidisciplinary collaboration and establishing a strong
supportive scientific network for early career investigators funded by the program. The P&F program plans to
fund 3 projects per year of up to $35,000 each. Decisions related to the awarding of funds will be based on a
rigorous and independent three-phase peer-review process that is modeled on the NIH system. The initial level
of review will involve screening of proposals to verify that applications meet the eligibility criteria. The second
level of review will involve a panel of MUSC experts whose primary function will be to evaluate the scientific and
technical merit of P&F applications. The third level of review will be performed by the DDRCC External Advisory
Board. Applications will be prioritized according to four criteria: 1) quality of the research (scientific merit,
innovation, and impact); 2) qualifications of the research team and ability to lead the research effort toward
securing extramural funding within a reasonable timeframe; 3) relevance to MUSC DDRCC goals and themes
as well as projected use of DDRCC cores, and 4) stimulation of collaborative efforts with DDRCC members
and/or projects. Funded investigators will receive one year of support along with free use of DDRCC core facilities
to explore investigator-initiated projects related to the mission of the DDRCC. Thus, the P&F Program will enable
investigators to form interdisciplinary, interactive, and sustainable research studies that will impact digestive and
liver disease research."
10823312,"This application is for renewal for a third cycle of a Predoctoral Training Program in Developmental Biology,
Stem Cells, and Regeneration at the University of Southern California (USC). This training program has both
benefitted from and contributed to the dramatic growth of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine research
at USC Keck School of Medicine. The presence of a dedicated Department of Stem Cell Biology and
Regenerative Medicine that has been actively recruiting new faculty, a highly successful PhD Program in
Development, Stem Cells, and Regeneration (DSR) that now averages ~15 new entering students per year, and
a university-wide USC Stem Cell initiative makes for a highly dynamic, ideal training environment for students.
The training program is designed to provide cohesive, structured training in developmental and stem cell biology,
coupled with training-grant-specific courses and activities that provide in-depth exposure to clinical problems and
advanced bioinformatics. Such a program will best train a future generation of scientists that wish to apply their
foundational research in developmental and stem cell biology to the field of regenerative medicine. A unique
strength of this training program is that it provides added value, beyond the DSR program, in the form of clinical
exposure. Each trainee is paired with a Clinical Co-Mentor, who guides the student in learning about the diseases
to which their primary research relates. Trainees take a T32-specific seminar class led by clinician scientists, as
well as a hands-on workshop in USC’s new GMP facility that exposes students to manufacturing of clinical-grade
stem cells and gene therapy reagents. This exposure of students to how stem cells can address unmet clinical
needs is aided by close ties of USC with one of the largest public hospitals in the country, and the extensive
participation of clinician-scientists in all aspects of the training program. Recently, we have also partnered with
the Department of Quantitative and Computational Biology to offer specialized computational biology training, in
direct response to feedback from trainees. During the previous four years of the training program, the 16 funded
trainees have published 30 manuscripts in journals such as Cell Stem Cell, Developmental Cell, PNAS, Neuron,
and PLoS Biology, and have received four NIH F31 fellowships. Of the 30 trainees since T32 inception, 16 have
graduated and 13 remain in training. All graduates have remained in science-intensive positions, with 7
performing postdocs, 6 entering industry, 3 pursuing science policy and journalism, and 1 recently accepting a
tenure-track assistant professorship at UCLA. From the first to second funding period, we have increased
diversity in our program (12.5% to 25% URM), success of NIH F31s (2 to 4), and the number of students in the
main DSR feeder program (~6 to ~15 per year), while decreasing time to degree (6.5 to 5.1 years). The students
have hosted a major symposium each year, including virtually during the pandemic, and we have instituted an
overnight Annual Retreat as of 2019. The cohesive structure of this training program provides an extra level of
clinical fluency that the trainees would not otherwise have obtained through the DSR feeder program alone."

10820011,"Project Summary
The long-term objective of the proposed research is to develop a new drug for Chagas disease,
an infectious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is estimated to
effect 6-8 million people, mainly in Latin America. The work is motivated by the inadequacy of
current therapies with respect to their poor efficacy and tolerability. In the previous grant period,
we made excellent progress advancing an early lead series (benzothiazoles) to the late
preclinical-candidate stage while defining the mechanism of action of mitosis inhibition in the
trypanosome. This novel mechanism of action is uniquely associated with parasite clearance in
both in vitro (washout) assays and in the chronic mouse model of T. cruzi infection. In this
proposal, we will focus on three new compounds scaffolds discovered in high-throughput
phenotypic screening assays against T. cruzi (EC50 values ~1 µM). The compounds were
selected because of follow up experiments showing that they work by the same mechanism of
action as the aforementioned benzothiazoles. The goal of the project will be to bring forward
these compounds as backup series in lieu of the benzothiazole compounds which were
associated with unexpected genotoxicity in Ames testing. The new compounds series (oxazoles,
thienopyrimidinones, and diazines) will go into medicinal chemistry lead optimization campaigns
for Chagas disease, an area in which we have over two decades of experience. With over 100
analogs of each scaffold already synthesized, we are developing a detailed understanding of
structure activity relationships. Compound testing will include in vitro assays for anti-
trypanosomal activity, mammalian cell cytotoxicity, solubility, mouse pharmacokinetics, and
murine efficacy models following a screening cascade with defined go/no-go criteria. At the end
of this three-year project, one to two drug candidates will be selected for late-stage preclinical
development for Chagas disease."
10819884,"Project Summary
Relapse to cocaine use, and the underlying failure to inhibit cocaine-seeking behavior, remain significant barriers
to the treatment of cocaine use disorder. However, our understanding of the neural pathways and network
mechanisms underlying the inhibition of cocaine seeking remain insufficient. Previous studies investigating fear
conditioning and drug seeking suggest that, often, the infralimbic cortex (IL) inhibits and the prelimbic cortex (PL)
promotes such behaviors. Although downstream projections from these brain regions have been identified in the
involvement of regulating fear conditioning and drug seeking, it is unknown what inputs to these regions
determine their influence over cocaine-seeking behavior. Evidence from fear conditioning studies suggests that
separate subpopulations of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons project to the PL vs. IL and oppose each other
for control over fear conditioning vs. the extinction thereof. These findings raise the possibility that the BLA is a
key region influencing PL and IL activity and determining the degree of cocaine-seeking behavior. Indeed, global
manipulations suggest that the BLA promotes cocaine seeking as well as fear conditioning, but more recent
reports suggest the BLA may also have a role in extinction and inhibition of drug seeking. However, whether the
BLA separately regulates the IL and PL to extinguish or engage in cocaine seeking and how these regions
engage in complex network interactions during cocaine seeking has never been investigated. Therefore, the
goal of this proposal is to examine BLA→IL and BLA→PL pathways in cocaine extinction learning using
optogenetics (Aim 1) and examine network activity in the BLA, IL, and PL simultaneously during cocaine
seeking via multi-site electrophysiological recordings (Aim 2). The overall hypothesis is that the BLA-IL
system is critical for the extinction of cocaine seeking, whereas the BLA-PL system opposes this effect and that
neural activity between these systems during cocaine seeking will reflect the degree of cocaine-seeking
behaviors. The findings from these experiments will provide fundamental knowledge regarding the neural
systems that regulate cocaine-seeking behaviors. The sponsor (Dr. Ryan LaLumiere) and co-sponsor (Dr.
Rainbo Hultman) for this proposal are leaders in the field of drug-seeking behavior and mood disorder,
respectively, and have expertise in all techniques needed for the proposed research. Moreover, the University
of Iowa and the Psychological and Brain Sciences Graduate Program provide an excellent environment and
resources for neuroscience research. The training plan for this work includes training in the technical and
conceptual skills for the proposed research along with development of teaching and mentoring skills, networking
through neuroscience conferences, scientific writing and presentations. Therefore, the applicant will receive first-
rate training that will propel her forward in her career and help to achieve her goals of becoming an independent
investigator."
10854983,"ABSTRACT
Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability, affecting almost 800,000 patients per year in the US. Most
stroke survivors have some degree of spontaneous recovery, but this recovery is unpredictable and in many
cases incomplete. Successful recovery requires plasticity at the synaptic and cellular level to collectively
“rewire” damaged brain networks, in a process called remapping. On a global scale, plasticity in brain networks
can be observed in the restoration of functional connectivity (fc) between repaired circuits and distant brain
networks. Fc likely contributes to recovery of more complex. However, little is known about the mechanisms
underlying network plasticity in remapping and fc. The overarching goal of this proposal is to understand
mechanisms of plasticity in brain networks after stroke. Enhancing these mechanisms of repair may be key to
designing therapies to improve recovery and attenuate disability after stroke.
Many of the processes underlying plasticity in the injured brain mirror those that occur in the developing
brain. Most saliently demonstrated in the visual cortex (V1) during development, binocular vision leads to
balanced segregation of eye inputs into ocular dominance (OD) columns in V1. Monocular deprivation (MD,
suturing one eye shut) during development leads the OD columns of the spared eye to competitively take over
the OD columns of the deprived eye, similar to remapping after stroke. This plasticity dissipates in adulthood
due to the maturation of inhibitory parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) in V1. PV-INs are the most prevalent
inhibitory neurons in the brain, and act as ‘brakes’ to close critical periods of developmental plasticity,
cementing in place mature spatial/temporal patterns of brain activity. However, recent studies have shown that
juvenile-like OD plasticity can be restored in adult mice by selectively reducing firing rates in PV-INs, or by
weakening the strength of excitatory synapses onto PV-INs (thus weakening their feed-forward inhibitory
activity). PV-INs have been further implicated in restricting plasticity in the hippocampus, striatum, prefrontal
cortex, and auditory cortex. Given the prevalence of PV-INs throughout the brain, these findings invite the
exciting possibility that PV-INs are “gate-keepers” of neuronal plasticity, and potential targets for therapeutic
intervention in the injured brain.
The central hypothesis of this grant is that activity in PV-INs regulates network plasticity during sensory
deprivation and after stroke. We will employ cutting edge non-invasive optical neuroimaging of cortical calcium
dynamics in mice to probe changes in local sensory maps and global fc, in combination with viral gene transfer
targeted to PV-INs, to understand the role of activity (Aim 1) and synaptic inputs onto PV-INs (Aim 2) in
mediating deprivation-induced cortical plasticity and recovery from stroke. Aim 1: To determine if modulating
PV-IN activity can enhance cortical plasticity during whisker sensory deprivation and recovery after ischemic
injury. Aim 2: Todetermine the mechanistic role of excitatory synapses onto PV-INs in regulating cortical
plasticity during whisker sensory deprivation and recovery after ischemic injury. Aim 3: To identify the
translatome of plasticity in PV and Pyramidal neurons during whisker deprivation and after ischemic injury."
10823251,"Background: Many Veterans live far away from a VAMC with substantial electroencephalography (EEG)
expertise. Travel is difficult for epilepsy patients since they often cannot drive. We propose to study a novel dry
electrode system (DES) which does not require EEG technologists to operate and can be operated by a nurse
assistant. This DES integrates the electrodes and EEG amplifier into a compact headset which is easily placed
on the head (without skin preparation) and could be used in an epilepsy telemedicine outreach program along
with clinical interviews. We have performed three preliminary studies with DES headsets. In our first two
studies in 33 Veterans performed at a VAMC, we found that the DES was quick to apply, taking only 5-6
minutes to put on by a research subject with the assistance of a neurologist. Subjects preferred the DES
headset over the standard EEG system (SES). In our third study a nurse performed 30 DES recordings in a VA
community based outpatient clinic (CBOC). Rating of the EEG recordings on a five point scale by three board
certified clinical EEG experts (after automated EEG artifact reduction was applied to the recordings) showed
that all 30 recordings were of acceptable quality (rated 3 out of 5 or higher with some artifact present) and 18
of 30 recordings were of good quality (rate 4 or above with only minor artifacts present).
Significant Impact: This study will improve access of Veterans with epilepsy living in rural areas to the most
important diagnostic procedure for the care of patients with epilepsy: the routine EEG. Being able to perform
routine EEG in CBOCs can decrease cost to the VA system since DES EEG systems are less expensive and
because Veterans will not have to travel to VAMCs for EEG. This study will also test the DES system to make
sure it can record epileptiform transients (ETs), the pattern in EEG which indicates that patients have epilepsy.
Innovation: This study is innovative because it will use a new recording system for EEG that just got FDA
approval. This new DES EEG recording system provides a method for recording EEG which is cheaper and
much easier to perform than conventional EEG. This study is also innovative because it will test for the first
time if a DES can reliably record ETs. (The FDA approval for the DES system was based on EEG signal
quality only and not whether it could reliably detect ETs.) The study will also use a new FDA-approved method
for automatically removing artifactual signals which can obscure DES EEG recordings.
Specific Aims: The first aim of the project is to test the ability of the DES to record ETs versus the SES. The
second aim is to collect data on appointment wait time, appointment cancellation rate, and procedure cost of
DES versus SES to project the improvement in Veteran access and potential cost-benefit of DES EEG
performed in CBOCs versus SES EEG performed in VAMCs.
Methodology: This is a randomized controlled trial which will be performed at three sites: the Charleston
VAMC, Durham VAMC, and Miami VAMC. For Specific Aim 1, 400 Veterans (200 with a history of an abnormal
EEGs in which ETs were recorded and 200 prospective Veterans scheduled for an outpatient EEG) will be
recruited to have a DES EEG procedure and a SES EEG procedure performed during a single study visit in a
VAMC by an EEG technologist. Each EEG recording will be interpreted and rated for technical quality by three
study investigators, who will also annotate the location of ETs in each EEG recording. The fraction of EEGs
which demonstrate ETs and the technical quality ratings will be compared. For Specific Aim 2, data will be
collected on 300 prospective Veterans scheduled for an outpatient routine EEG, including appointment
cancellation rate, travel cost, and other patient factors. Costs for EEG equipment/supplies as well as technician
effort/salary and nurse and nurse assistant effort/salary will also be collected. This will be used to project the
potential improvement in patient access and potential cost savings of a nurse or nurse technician performing
outpatient DES EEG in a CBOC versus an EEG technician performing outpatient SES EEG in a VAMC."
10823252,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biases in whether and how social interactions are perceived are a hallmark symptom of most major mental
illnesses (e.g., people with autism tend to under-perceive social interactions, people with paranoid schizophrenia
tend to over-perceive social interactions, and people with depression tend to perceive social interactions in a
negative light). These biases likely reflect the extreme end of a continuum that exists in the normative population,
suggesting that characterizing individual differences in social-perceptual styles is critical to furthering our
understanding of disease. That humans are primed to perceive social interactions even in stripped-down,
unlifelike stimuli (e.g., animations of geometric shapes) is a phenomenon that has long been recognized and
exploited to study social cognition in both normative and patient populations. However, when it comes to these
basic stimuli, while we may have the intuition that we “know it when we see it”, we do not understand what it is
about stimuli deemed social that makes them social—in other words, which specific visual features are required,
and in what doses. Furthermore, because task paradigms are often a simple binary choice (i.e., ‘social’ or
‘random’), we do not understand heterogeneity across individuals in terms of their thresholds for deciding if a
given stimulus represents a social interaction, and if so, what kind of social interaction (i.e., positive or negative).
A critical step toward understanding and correcting biased social cognition in mental illness is to define the
fundamental sensory features of basic social interactions, and determine how and why different people compute
differently on these features to give rise to different social percepts. This will open the door to interventions that
can prevent an individual from going down a biased path. In this project, we will establish a social stimulus class
for which we have precise, parametric control over low-level visual features. This will allow us to construct
individual “social tuning curves” for various types of social interactions and determine how variability in these
tuning curves relates to trait phenotypes. Combining these stimuli with simultaneous neuroimaging (fMRI) and
eye-tracking will shed light on where in the processing hierarchy percepts diverge within and across individuals,
and allow us to test the hypothesis that social percepts emerge earlier in the cortical hierarchy than previously
thought. This would indicate that idiosyncratic social cognition is more closely linked to automatic, sensory-driven
processes than controlled reflection, a distinction that is important for informing diagnostic and interventional
tools. Finally, within a set of densely sampled individuals, we will directly test causality between stimulus features,
brain activity, and percepts using real-time fMRI to implicitly steer individuals toward a given percept based on
ongoing patterns of brain activity. The outcome of the proposed research will be a causal model of how stimulus
features and brain dynamics interact to give rise to a given social percept within a given individual. This model
will provide testable hypotheses regarding targeted therapies to normalize biased cognition in mental illnesses."
10823255,"Macrophages play a key role in the pathogenesis of various autoimmune and rheumatic diseases.
An important mechanism by which activated macrophages contribute to disease pathogenesis is production
of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-1 and IL-6. These cytokines are canonical NF-B target genes
and validated therapeutic targets. The long term goals of this project are to understand how inflammatory
macrophage activation is regulated, with the associated goal of developing new therapies that selectively
suppress pathogenic macrophage functions, while preserving homeostatic functions and host defense.
 Type I IFNs and IFN- are important regulators of immunity and inflammation. IFNs activate the JAK-
STAT signaling pathway to induce canonical interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Expression of IFN target
genes (termed an ‘IFN signature’) is one of the most prominent molecular pathways activated in several
autoimmune diseases including RA, lupus nephritis, and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) (and
related familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (fHLH)). IFNs are clearly pathogenic in monogenic
‘interferonopathies’ and fHLH, where patients are responsive to JAK inhibitors and IFN- blockade. JAK
inhibitors, which target IFNs amongst other cytokines, are effective in RA and are being tested in SLE.
 Although IFNs do not directly activate pathogenic non-ISG inflammatory NF-B target genes such
as TNF, IL1B and IL6, they potentiate induction of these genes by TNF and TLRs. This supports the
possibility that the therapeutic efficacy of IFN blockade or Jak inhibitors may be mediated at least in part by
direct suppression of inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages. In accord with this notion, JAK
inhibitors decrease inflammatory responses and cytokines in RA patients, primed human macrophages, RA
synovial macrophages and tissue explants, and in preclinical models of arthritis and MAS/fHLH.
 In the previous project period we found that IFN-JAK-STAT signaling induces chromatin remodeling
at inflammatory NF-B target genes to make these genes hyper-responsive to inflammatory signals and
resistant to suppression. IFNs also selectively suppressed components of the macrophage response to the
suppressive cytokine IL-10 by deactivating enhancers. These data provide insights into pathways that
connect IFN-JAK-STAT signaling to inflammatory NF-B target genes and support our overarching
hypothesis that IFNs help drive inflammatory non-ISG gene expression via chromatin-based mechanisms.
 In this project we will investigate epigenetic mechanisms by which IFNs drive macrophage activation
and expression of pathogenic NF-B target genes such as TNF, IL1B and IL6, and mechanisms by which
JAK inhibitors suppress these genes. We anticipate that our studies will yield insights that can be used to
develop novel therapeutic strategies to suppress inflammatory responses, and help understand how
epigenetic mechanisms can contribute to poor efficacy of therapies that target upstream signaling pathways."

 Decades of neuroprotection clinical trials for large vessel occlusion (LVO) acute ischemic stroke (AIS) failed to translate
clinically. While these clinical trials were conducted, two treatments were approved for LVO AIS: 1) tPA thrombolysis within
6 hrs; and 2) Endovascular Arterial Thrombectomy (EAT) within 24 hrs of stroke onset were developed with strict
imaging guidelines and only 25% qualified for treatment. A tacit assumption in Neuroprotection is tissue to protect.
Neuroprotection clinical trials in AIS did not qualify patients by imaging. In ""A New Paradigm for Neuroprotection

Shearit, LLC, promotes Lamiflo™ a 4000kDA drag reducing polymer (DRP) of polyethylene oxide (US Patent
9,763,975 B1, Sept. 19, 2017) for cerebrovascular disease. and cancer (U.S. Patent No. 10,792,304 issued
October 6, 2020). Lamiflo™ is the only treatment for AIS enhancing flow by the physical dynamics blood and red
blood cell (RBC) flow, not pharmacologically and does not rely on tissue or vascular viability. It converts turbulent
to laminar flow occurring at blood vessel bifurcations, vascular calcifications. It reduces near vessel wall cell free
layer, axial RBC flow, plasma skimming and increases capillary RBC density to improve tissue oxygenation.
Increased microvascular flow increases capillary endothelial wall shear rate, (highest in capillaries). Low
endothelial wall shear rate detected by the glycocalyx wreaks havoc on endothelial function--increased water
permeability, leukocyte endothelial adhesion and transendothelial transport, decreased nitric oxide synthesis, and
increased cytokine, chemokine and microglial activation. Specific Aim: Demonstrate that Lamiflo™ at plasma levels
of 5, and 10 ppm injected i.v.at 1 hr after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) decreases the ischemic
penumbra and core volumes after 2.5 hrs of tMCAO by monofilament (MFO) and embolism thrombus occlusion
(EBO) without increasing the rate of hemorrhagic transformation (HT) and with 20% improved neurobehavioral
recovery. One year old Sprague Dawley (SD) male and female rats are treated with Lamiflo™ i.v. at 1 hr after tMCAO
by: 1) monofilament occlusion (MFO) or 2) embolus occlusion (EBO) with revascularization at 2.5 hrs, by MFO
filament withdrawal and rtPA infusion for EBO. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at baseline, at 2.5 hrs before
reperfusion to quantitate Lamiflo™ reduction of penumbra and core volumes (Aim #1); and at 10 days recovery for
final core volumes (Aim #2). HT is quantitated by MRI susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) and quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) after 10 days recovery and Perl's iron stain. These studies will show the efficacy of
Lamiflo™in reducing the volume of core and penumbra and improve neurologic recovery without increasing HT
after tMCAO. Lamiflo™ is potentially useful in stroke prevention, patients not qualified for either therapy or even
after a stroke when a second stroke is likely. Positive results in this Phase I study will provide the basis for a Phase
II application with a start date of: April 5, 2024 and FDA approval for an Investigational New Drug (IND)."

The neural circuit that controls mammalian reproduction delivers circadian information from the suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN) via the neuropeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) to the
kisspeptin (Kiss) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons, respectively. Infertility can be caused
at the neuroendocrine level by genetic defects in GnRH neurons, Kiss neurons, and/or circadian pacemaker and
neuropeptide neurons in the SCN. GnRH neurons arise in the olfactory placode, migrate into the hypothalamus,
and extend their axons to the median eminence to deliver GnRH to the pituitary in response to Kiss signals.
Disrupted migration, neurite pathfinding, and/or disregulated secretion of Kiss or GnRH neurons result in failures
of puberty, fertility, and reproductive function. We have determined that the homeodomain transcription factors,
Vax1, Six3, and Six6, are all crucial for reproduction. Six6 Knock-out (KO) mice exhibit strikingly decreased
fertility, while heterozygote Vax1 and Six3 mice are subfertile (Vax1 and Six3 KO mice are perinatal lethal).
Though GnRH neuron numbers are normal at e13.5, all three of the KO embryos have ~90% reductions in
hypothalamic GnRH neurons by e17.5. Vax1, Six3, and Six6 are found in Kiss neurons and regulate expression
of the Kiss promoter in Kiss-expressing cell lines. In addition, deletion of Six3 from Kiss neurons causes
subfertility. Furthermore, all three KO e17.5 embryos lack SCN morphology and fail to express AVP and VIP,
and Six6 KO adults lack circadian rhythms. The overall goal of this application is to elucidate the development
of this fundamental reproductive neuroendocrine circuit (SCNKissGnRH) at the molecular, developmental,
and physiological levels. We propose three Specific Aims: Aim 1 will investigate differentiation and maturation
of GnRH neurons during migration by determining the fate of neurons lacking these factors and effects on their
migratory pathway. Aim 2 will focus on the roles of Vax1, Six3, and Six6 in the development and function of Kiss
neurons in vitro and in vivo with a focus on direct regulation of Kiss gene expression and effects on fertility. Aim
3 will address the fundamental mechanisms of SCN development, the contribution of Vax1, Six3, and Six6 to
AVP and VIP gene expression, and investigate the roles of SCN circadian function in fertility. Our overarching
hypothesis is that infertility due to defects in Vax1, Six3, and Six6 is caused by alterations in specific
hypothalamic neuroendocrine cell populations within the hypothalamic SCNKissGnRH reproductive
neurocircuit by regulation of development, hormone synthesis, and circadian rhythms. We believe that studies
of these key homeodomain proteins will reveal fundamental mechanisms in the control of reproductive function
and circadian rhythms and provide valuable insight into novel regulatory pathways important for the development
and function of this neuroendocrine circuit. This multifaceted approach will yield a comprehensive understanding
of their roles in fertility and circadian rhythms in vivo and in vitro, and provide further insight into the fundamental
genetic control of infertility and circadian rhythms."

This training grant is founded on the belief that a new model is needed for training the cutaneous biologists of
the future. The model of being either a researcher or a clinician ought to be supplanted by one where talented
and enthusiastic individuals have exposure to the information, techniques and colleagues necessary for the
growing need for collaborative science. In addition, there is a clear need for a program that is suitable for
physician postdoctoral fellows, especially since CTSA funded K awards are extremely limited. We will continue
to develop such a cadre through our novel training program with a customized curriculum of investigative
and clinically relevant experiences, individually tailored to each trainee and focused on a clinical area
or disease process. Specifically, each curriculum will comprise 1) laboratory-based research, guided by their
Mentor and Mentoring Committee composed of program members with complementary strengths and
expertise; 2) didactics chosen with the translational aspects of that research project in mind; and 3) focused
clinical involvement (for physician trainees) complementary to the research project. In addition to providing our
trainees with rigorous scientific instruction in the specific area of their choosing, we shall mentor and guide
them to ensure a successful transition to productive investigative careers, preparing them for independent skin
biology and skin disease related biomedical research. We propose to engage two MD, PhD or MD/PhD
trainees annually into a two-year postdoctoral training program with an optional third year. We have assembled
a stellar team of mentors in broad areas relevant to cutaneous biology and skin diseases, and an innovative
guidance program to ensure that we grow mentors as well as trainees."
10816836,"Human glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and deadly primary human adult brain cancer, remains incurable
with median survivals of 12-20 months. Despite numerous clinical trials, the standard of care temozolomide and
radiation treatment has been unchanged since its introduction in 2005. Arguably, the major contributor to GBM
malignancy is the glioma stem-like cell (GSC). Although a relatively small minority cancer cell population, GSCs
have a disproportionately large role in driving GBM progression by their inherent treatment resistant and diffusely
invasive growth capacity that limit the effectiveness of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Conversely, the
larger pool of non-stem glioma cells (NSGCs) are more responsive to standard chemo-radiation and less
invasive. These properties underlie an emerging interest in strategies to reprogram GSCs to less malignant and
more treatment responsive NSGC phenotypes. The role of GSC intrinsic electrical signaling or bioelectricity
(BioE) has fundamental influences on cell states with relevance to therapeutic GSC reprogramming. For
example, BioE signaling is largely regulated through ion channel mediated regulation of voltage membrane
potential (Vmem) whereby depolarization promotes undifferentiated stem-like phenotypes and increased
proliferation while hyperpolarization drives differentiated (i.e., non-stem) and less proliferative states. Here we
test the hypothesis that patterned optogenetic neuro-modulation (PONM) of Vmem can reprogram GSC
phenotypes. Optogenetic techniques provide unprecedented temporal and spatial control of BioE regulation not
possible with genetic, pharmacologic or transcranial electrical stimulation. Using in vitro and in vivo orthotopic
human GSC xenograft models, we will determine how chronicity, intensity, and temporal-spatial modulation of
activating and inhibitory optogenetic channels in GSCs impacts proliferation and stem cell properties. The system
functions through expression of activating channel rhodopsins and inhibitory halorhodopsins, cell cycle sensors,
and novel light delivery platforms that permit facile temporal-spatial regulation of BioE/Vmem and real-time or
post-hoc analysis of GSC phenotypes. Aim 1 will quantify the parameters of PONM that reprogram GSC
phenotypes in vitro while Aim 2 tests the impact of PONM on GSC phenotypes in vivo in GSC xenograft models.
GSC reprogramming will be assessed by quantitation of changes in malignant phenotypes (proliferation, and
invasion) and stem cell properties (self-renewal and quiescence) through a combination of real-time or post-
stimulation assays and gene expression profiling. Stability of reprogrammed phenotypes will be assessed by
delayed in vitro and in vivo analysis after termination of photo-stimulation. The effects of Vmem modulation on
reprogramming GSC xenografts will be measured by histologic, cellular, and molecular profiling analysis of
tumors treated with intratumoral optogenetic stimulation. These studies are expected to provide novel proof of
principle that electrical modulation can reprogram GSC states and support further investigation of targeting
Vmem as a therapeutic adjunct to improve GBM treatment responses and outcomes."

Stroke commonly disrupts the corticospinal tract (CST) and impairs hand function, but current rehabilitation
approaches incompletely restore pre-stroke hand motor control. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
interventions that target the residual CST and strengthen its neural transmission are promising candidates for
enhancing paretic hand muscle activation during rehabilitation and promoting true hand motor recovery. To
maximize their therapeutic effects, poststroke TMS interventions must reliably activate the residual CST and
enhance residual CST transmission. We and others recently showed that neurotypical adults exhibit
spontaneous resting brain activity patterns during which TMS most strongly activates the CST (i.e., strong CST
states). When TMS interventions are delivered during these strong CST states, they preferentially enhance CST
transmission and enhance motor learning. However, virtually all poststroke TMS interventions are uncoupled
from strong CST states, such that only a fraction of TMS stimuli occur when the residual CST is best activated
by TMS and neural transmission within it is most likely to be enhanced. Instead, poststroke TMS interventions
should be delivered solely during strong CST states. Because each stroke survivor has a unique pattern of brain
damage, recovery-related brain reorganization, and motor impairment, these strong CST states must be fully
personalized. To address these issues, we developed a novel real-time EEG-informed TMS system that delivers
stimulation during personalized strong CST states. Our system uses personalized machine learning classifiers
and participant-specific datasets to identify multivariate EEG activity patterns that predict strong CST activation,
indexed by large motor-evoked potentials (MEPs). Once these EEG activity patterns are detected in real-time,
TMS is delivered. In this project, we will demonstrate the feasibility of real-time EEG-informed personalized brain
state-dependent TMS in chronic stroke survivors while also determining hand impairment inclusion criteria for
future clinical trials that investigate this promising personalized brain stimulation approach. In Aim 1, we will
establish feasibility of real-time personalized brain state-dependent TMS in the poststroke CST system by
comparing MEP amplitudes elicited during strong CST states to those elicited during random CST states. In Aim
2, we will correlate differences in MEP amplitudes elicited during strong versus random CST states with
poststroke hand impairment. We will then identify the hand impairment levels of stroke survivors who exhibit
larger MEPs during personalized strong than random CST states; previous literature suggests that these stroke
survivors are most likely to benefit from future personalized poststroke brain state-dependent TMS interventions.
Overall, this project will demonstrate feasibility of personalized poststroke brain state-dependent TMS and
establish hand impairment inclusion criteria for future clinical trials that test this novel approach. Our results are
expected to motivate an R01 proposal that investigates the therapeutic effects of personalized poststroke brain
state-dependent TMS interventions."

Obesity worsens asthma severity, and nonatopic asthma that presents late-onset in obese individuals is a distinct
asthma phenotype. Obesity-associated asthma poses a challenge to clinical management due to poor
therapeutic response to asthma controller medications, resulting in increased frequency of asthma exacerbations
and elevated risk of hospitalization. The microbiome-metabolome is a promising target for obesity-associated
asthma. Numerous studies support that obesity-associated perturbations to the gut microbiome are
mechanistically involved in enhanced airway responsiveness in asthma. Airway hyperresponsiveness is elevated
in asthma patients with obesogenic microbiomes. Alterations to host-microbial metabolism in obesity include
short-chain fatty acids and other small metabolites involved inflammatory signaling pathways along the gut-lung
axis. We have established that nitro-oleic acid, a nitrated fatty acid, targets systemic inflammation in both the
host and the gut microbiome. Nitro-oleic acid activates anti-inflammatory (Nrf2) and inhibits proinflammatory (NF-
κB) cell signaling pathways in the host while reducing the abundance of unclassified Oscillospiraceae bacterial
species associated with detrimental increased small airway resistance in obese asthma. This proposal aims to
test the hypothesis that exogenous administration of nitro-oleic acid will modify gut microbiota
composition and function to restore microbial-derived metabolites and produce endogenous anti-
inflammatory mediators. In Aims 1-2, I will identify contributions from the microbiome, metabolome, and nitro-
oleic acid treatment to pulmonary function in a murine model of obesity-associated asthma. Aim 1 will
characterize changes to the microbiome, metabolome, and inflammatory gene expression in the lungs following
nitro-oleic acid treatment in order to determine how nitro-oleic acid modifies host-microbial anti-inflammatory
signaling and metabolism. I have recently adapted a new technique of profiling changes to the microbiome and
microbial-derived metabolites with stable isotope probes. Aim 2 will apply this method to track nitro-oleic acid-
driven changes to gut microbiota composition and to discern which disease-modifying metabolites are derived
from the microbiome. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop targeted therapy options for obesity-
associated asthma and reduce patient morbidity and mortality through improved control of airway
hyperresponsiveness. The proposal findings will be translated into the clinical setting to leverage the gut
microbiome and microbial-derived metabolites to manage symptoms and recover lung function in patients with
obesity-associated asthma."

Despite the benefits of physical activity (PA) to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic
diseases, few adult Latinas meet PA guidelines. Given the central role of faith-based organizations (FBOs)
within the Latino community and their commitment to the well-being of their members, FBOs are ideal settings
for health promotion. Evidence-based approaches for increasing PA and reducing obesity such as Faith in
Action exist, but few PA interventions go to scale. Implementation strategies that enhance the capacity of FBO
leaders and community health workers (promotoras) to implement EBIs can facilitate their uptake. We propose
to enhance Faith in Action with three organization-level strategies designed to increase program fit and
effectiveness: 1) training FBO leaders in health promotion 2) tailoring messaging to enhance fit between Faith
in Action and each unique FBO context, and 3) empowering promotoras to advocate for organizational change.
Given the need to improve strategies to sustain health programs in community settings, we propose to test the
influence of two additional sustainment strategies: 1) strengthening community collaborations and 2) providing
technical support. We will conduct a hybrid type II effectiveness-implementation trial using a clustered RCT
design to test the impact of the proposed implementation strategies on organization-level change and
individual behavior in diverse FBOs for a 12-month intervention and 6-month follow-up. Thirty-two FBOs will be
randomly assigned to a Standard EBI condition (Faith in Action as originally implemented), an Enhanced
condition (Standard condition + organizational-level implementation strategies), or Enhanced + Sustainment
condition (Enhanced implementation condition + sustainment strategies). We will collect quantitative and
qualitative data at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months post baseline. The proposed study aims to:
1) Test the short and long-term impacts of organization-level implementation strategies in 2 Enhanced
conditions on organizational outcomes compared to the Standard EBI condition, 2) Examine individual reach
and effectiveness among Latinas (n=812) in FBOs in the 2 Enhanced conditions compared to the Standard
EBI condition. Secondary aims examine theoretical mechanisms of action (e.g., organizational climate) and the
additional impact of two sustainment strategies. Informed by the Practical Robust Implementation and
Sustainability Model (PRISM) and Reach Effectiveness-Adoption Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM)
frameworks, the current study will use mixed methods to adapt Faith in Action to diverse FBOs. This research
is innovative because it experimentally tests organization-level implementation strategies and their associated

providing rigorously derived evidence for the scale-up of innovative EBIs in FBOs. If successful, findings from
the current study will provide evidence of organizational-level strategies for uptake, sustainment, and
generalizable implementation strategies for scale-up of PA interventions to increase PA and reduce chronic

Clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated perturbations to the cerebrovascular network in
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) in sex-specific manner. Altered blood flow, cerebrovascular reactivity, and vessel
topologies are all hallmarks of progressing AD in animal models and in human subjects. Blood-borne protein
biomarkers have reported altered profiles in humans and mouse models of AD. AD research has
predominately focused on neuronal, inflammatory and glial markers of disease progression. At the present
time there are no studies that directly relate AD-induced changes in angioarchitecture to blood-borne protein
biomarkers of endothelial stress and vascular dysfunction. Similarly, there are no studies linking blood borne
protein biomarkers to vessel genomics, specifically targeting endothelial cell genes. This is a critical gap with
significant clinical value because several studies suggest that vascular abnormalities precede AD onset.
Therefore, blood-borne protein biomarkers could be used to predict likelihood of vulnerability to AD, disease
onset and progression. This gap in knowledge will be addressed by this proposal, with the goal of describing
the temporal evolution and relationships between damaged vascular networks and blood-based protein
biomarkers and vascular genes. We have previously reported in AD mouse models there is an altered
vascular density and complexity with increasing age. Sex differences have also been poorly studied within
the context of vascular biomarkers, a gap we will also directly address in this proposal. Four interrelated but
not interdependent Aims will elucidate the relationship between vessel genomics, cerebrovascular structure
and function modifications and blood-borne protein biomarkers of endothelial and vascular functions. Aim 1
will examine in fine detail the timeline of vascular function structural changes over the lifetime (4, 12, >18mo)
in 5xFAD mice of both sexes. Known risk variants will be added to clarify the effects of amyloid β seeding.
The blood-based biomarkers will focus on proteins of endothelial stress, vascular damage and recovery
(VEGF, vWF, Claudin-5, etc), glial (GFAP), inflammation (IL-1b, TNFa, HMGB1, IL6, MMP9) and neuronal
damage and neurodegeneration (NF-L, Tau and its various phosphorylated forms and Abeta40 and 42). We
believe that a panel of blood-borne biomarkers will accurately reflect the underlying cerebrovascular
abnormalities with increasing age. Aim 2 will utilize the 3xTg AD mouse that has early amyloid β followed by
tau deposition and 3xTg mice with the addition of risk variants. Aims 1-3 will utilize the identical methods
biomarkers, genomes and structure/function assessments. Aim 4 will model all the findings to identify a
unique biomarker set that has predictive capabilities for AD onset. The proposed project will provide technical
and conceptual innovations through using a unique combinatory approach to establish direct relationships
between blood-borne biomarkers and vascular function and topology, as well as genomic markers from the
same animals of both sexes using PWI MRI, 2-photon microscopy, vessel painting, state-of-the-art spatial
transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA-seq and blood-borne protein biomarkers. Such innovative
biomarkers would enable early identification of patients with elevated risk for AD, prediction of AD onset and
severity, and objective monitoring treatment efficacy, our long-term research objectives."
10808951,"Cellular senescence is now recognized as one of the fundamental aging mechanisms contributing to multiple
age-related degenerative conditions, including osteoporosis. In previous studies, we have systematically
identified senescent cells in the bone microenvironment and demonstrated a causal role for senescent cells in
mediating age-related bone loss in mice. In recent studies, we used a novel transgenic mouse model, p16-
LOX-ATTAC, capable of temporal- and cell-specific senescent cell clearance, and found that in contrast to
global clearance of senescent cells using the (p16)-INK-ATTAC model, clearance specifically of senescent
osteocytes only partially replicated the beneficial skeletal effects of global senescent cell clearance, suggesting
an important role for other cells in the bone microenvironment (e.g., immune cells) in contributing to skeletal
aging. In addition, in our previous work, we demonstrated a dramatic upregulation of the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in bone marrow myeloid cells with aging, and more recent studies by
our investigative team have shown that with aging, activated neutrophils can induce senescence in multiple
tissues in a paracrine manner. Conversely, senescent cells are capable of attracting neutrophils, which then
further propagate senescence to other cells. Collectively, these studies point to previously unexplored cross-
talk between skeletal and immune cells, specifically in the context of cellular senescence. Thus, our central
hypothesis is that senescence of immune cells contributes to skeletal deterioration and conversely, senescent
skeletal cells attract and contribute to an inflammatory and/or senescent phenotype of immune cells. We will
test this hypothesis by examining the effects of senescent immune cells on bone and in the reverse
experiment, evaluating the effects of senescent skeletal cells on immune cells. Our proposed studies make use
of novel mouse models: p16-LOX-ATTAC mice, developed in the Khosla/Monroe laboratory, which are capable
of temporal- and cell-specific (when crossed with a Cre mouse) senescent cell clearance; and Ercc1-/fl mice,
developed by Drs. Niedernhofer and Robbins (Co-Is), where we can induce a tissue-specific DNA repair defect
leading to premature cellular senescence only in that tissue (e.g., immune or skeletal cells). Collectively, our
studies will address a number of fundamental questions relevant to osteoimmunology: (1) What are the specific
populations of bone marrow immune cells that undergo senescence with aging using strictly defined criteria for
cellular senescence (rather than the much broader umbrella of “immunosenescence” that includes
inflammatory, but not necessarily senescent cells); (2) Does chronological or premature aging of the immune
system cause skeletal deterioration?; (3) Conversely, do senescent skeletal cells lead to senescence, or at
least inflammation, in bone marrow immune cells and does this further propagate senescence to other skeletal
cells and perhaps systemically?; and (4) What are the potential mediators of the cross-talk between senescent
skeletal cells and senescent/inflammatory immune cells?"
10808953,"Summary
Peripheral nerve injury activates pattern recognition receptors (i.e. Toll-like receptors) in immune cells, thus
triggering and maintaining inflammation, and ultimately determining the perpetuation of pain. Immune cell
activation demands high levels of protein synthesis, folding and secretion, which are regulated by the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). An excessive demand in protein handling can evoke ER stress (accumulation of
misfolded proteins) and consequently trigger robust activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). IRE1α-
XBP1 is the most evolutionarily conserved arm of the UPR and can be directly activated via Toll-like receptor
engagement to promote the expression of pro-inflammatory factors. We have unveiled that conditional knockout
(cKO) mice devoid of IRE1α/XBP1 in immune cells (Ern1/Xbp1f/f-Vav1cre), display decreased PGE2 production
in vivo, reduced nociceptor responsiveness, and faster resolution of non-reflexive pain-related behaviors
following paw incision. Similarly, these cKO mice exhibit improved recovery after partial sciatic nerve ligation
(PSNL). Through unbiased genome-wide transcriptomic analyses we found that IRE1α-XBP1 signaling in
leukocytes is critically required for the induction of prostanoids, cytokines and other novel factors such as Nupr1
(associated with chronic inflammatory diseases in humans). Of note, IRE1α-XBP1 overactivation has been
correlated with painful or inflammatory conditions in humans. Therefore, we hypothesize that IRE1α-XBP1
signaling in leukocytes governs peripheral neuro-immune interactions and the development of chronic
pain. Using cutting-edge experimental approaches, we will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Determine
how IRE1α-XBP1 signaling dictates the dynamics of immune cell infiltration and molecular changes that drive
behavioral non-reflexive hypersensitivity following peripheral nerve injury. We postulate that the IRE1α-XBP1
arm operates as a key modulator of pro-algesic factors in immune cells, and that Nupr1 is a novel XBP1-
dependent factor (using ChIP PCR) implicated in PSNL. 2) Establish how IRE1α-XBP1 activation governs
individualized immune cellular reprogramming and how this drives the cross-talk with nociceptor afferents
following peripheral nerve injury. Our hypothesis is that the reduced hypersensitivity observed in our cKO mice
following PSNL is determined by discrete gene signatures in specific injury-infiltrating leukocyte subsets (using
single cell RNA sequencing), and by the acquisition of a less responsive phenotype in nociceptors (via in vivo
intracellular DRG recordings). 3) Define the therapeutic potential of inhibiting IRE1a to accelerate recovery from
PSNL. We posit that pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α using MKC8866 (RNAase domain inhibitor) or KIRA6
(kinase domain inhibitor) will prevent or treat chronic neuropathic pain. Our team has expertise in pain biology
and neuroimmune interactions (Romero-Sandoval), immunology and ER stress biology (Cubillos-Ruiz), in vivo
electrophysiology (Boada), and scRNAseq and bioinformatics (Miller). Thus, we are uniquely positioned to test
our innovative hypothesis and contribute to the development of novel non-narcotic treatments for chronic pain."
10805685,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Renal cysts are the hallmark of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD; the fourth major
cause of end-stage kidney disease). The current paradigm of the disease pathogenesis is based on
progressive growth of renal cysts over the life of an ADPKD patient, with the most prominent cysts being
those that emerged in utero. Data obtained with our new image analysis tools, new animal model, and
ADPKD patients show instead that individual cysts' growth rates are highly variable and change over time.
In fact, the proportion of growing cysts is nearly matched by those that are regressing, and an index that
quantifies this growing and regressing cyst phenotype predicts better renal outcomes than total kidney
volume (TKV; an FDA-approved ADPKD biomarker). The use of this new individual cyst-based biomarker
in future studies is likely to transform ADPKD classification and staging to achieve earlier and more accurate
identification of high-risk patients with ADPKD, including children (who have relatively small TKVs).
However, fundamental questions for understanding disease pathobiology and developing new ADPKD
therapeutics remain unanswered. For example, why do some cysts grow faster than others, and why do
some disappear? Since these questions cannot be answered in mouse models (they require two affected
PKD gene alleles to develop cysts and their cysts appear to grow progressively over time without
regression), we propose to study these concepts in our new Pkd2K874A*1/+ rat that develops the growing and
regressing cysts as a heterozygote (like humans). However, since the cyst growth rates are variable and
change over longer time intervals, we propose to use acute kidney injury (AKI) as a model for the initial
dynamic phase of individual cyst growth and the later phase of cyst regression. Since complement C3 is
one of few factors that modulate AKI and cystogenesis and were associated with the rate of human ADPKD
progression, our central hypothesis is that C3 regulates the injury-induced dynamic growth phase of
individual cyst growth in carriers of pathogenic ADPKD gene variants. We will address this central
hypothesis in two Aims: Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that the injury-induced dynamic growth phase of most
renal cysts in heterozygous carriers of the Pkd2 gene defect is mediated by C3 activity - by testing the
effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in animals generated from crosses of the available Pkd2K874A*1/+
and C3 knockout rats. We will complement our advanced MRI imaging techniques (allowing individual renal
cyst monitoring through their co-registration over time) with a single cell and spatial transcriptomics to reveal
which cells and pathways define the dynamic vs. regression phase of individual cyst growth, and how they
are affected by C3 deficiency. Aim 2 will replicate Aim 1 in the already available Pkd1 knockout rat model
(PKD1 and PKD2 genes are the two major ADPKD genes and their protein products form a heterotrimeric
complex)."

Growing evidence supports a robust and likely causal association between cardiovascular disease (CVD), and
its risk factors, with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, standard paradigms such as “head to heart connection”,
where heart failure leads to cerebral hypoperfusion, neuronal damage and, subsequently AD are questionable,
and they should be reviewed with a critical approach.
Here, we claim that vascular endothelial cells have a central role in the development and progression of AD and
hypertension. Over time, as the body ages, the vasculature becomes less susceptible to repair. One of the
reasons is an exacerbated endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT). EndMT is a cellular
transdifferentiation program in which endothelial cells partially lose their identity and acquire mesenchymal cell-
like features and this reduces blood flow and organ perfusion. One of the triggers of EndMT is endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, which also releases misfolded proteins, including amyloid-β protein oligomers (AβO), the
most potent neurotoxin in AD. Here, we observed that 1. dysfunctional vascular tissue from humans and rodents
releases and senses AβO. 2. Vascular dysfunction is prominent prior to the onset of AD. 3. Increased plasma
levels of AβO are present in hypertensive mice. 4. AβO induced ER stress in endothelial cells and ER stress
caused the further release of AβO, showing a positive feedforward mechanism. These unconventional
observations call for further analysis of the causative connection between endothelial dysfunction and AD.
Therefore, the overall goal of this Exploratory and Developmental Grants (R21) project is to reprogram
endothelial cells for the treatment of AD and hypertension. For this, we will test the hypotheses that the cause
of AD and hypertension is the exacerbated formation of EndMT via ER stress which increases the secretion of
AβO. By overexpressing Yamanaka factors (OSK) to induce partial cellular reprogramming, without passing
through the pluripotent state, we will reduce EndMT formation to prevent and reverse AD. We also want to
determine whether artery dysfunction in hypertensive mice present with similar phenotype seen in AD mice.
This planned research is uniquely suited to the R21 program, rather than to a traditional grant (e.g., R01),
because it explores and opens a new area of research in my laboratory, by studying EndMT and Yamanaka
factors as the underpinning of AD. If our hypothesis is correct, this project will produce a major impact on AD
and CVD."

Immune cells at the maternal/fetal interface play dual roles of orchestrating immune tolerance required for
pregnancy maintenance, while also protecting against placental pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV).
Specialized inhibitory immune cells, known as natural killer (NK) cells, are predominant and dynamic immune
cells populating the decidua throughout gestation. Yet, there is a major gap in our understanding of the role of
NK cells in protection of the fetus against immune rejection and pathogen invasion. The role of NK cells,
including recently identified cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific memory NK cells, in the interplay between fetal
tolerance and protection against congenital CMV transmission is poorly defined. This study aims to define the
role of maternal NK cell populations in regulation of fetal tolerance and protection against placental CMV
transmission in the setting of chronic maternal CMV infection. Our group is uniquely equipped to dissect the
immunologic functions at the maternal-fetal interface with significant expertise in both a nonhuman primate
(NHP) model of pregnancy and placental CMV transmission as well as investigations of immune cells at the
maternal-fetal interface in human placenta and cord blood. The NHP model affords the opportunity to study the
immunology and physiology of pregnancy across the gestational stages through elective fetal harvest and
access to the immune cells at the maternal-fetal interface, as well as validated strategies for peripheral and
tissue depletion of effector NK cells in vivo. We hypothesize that maternal NK cells are critical to both
pregnancy maintenance and prevention of CMV reactivation in early pregnancy. Understanding this
intersection between maintaining immune tolerance while protecting against placental pathogens is critical to
developing immune-based strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality resulting from adverse pregnancy
outcomes."
10795933,"Former preterm infants are exposed to oxygen (O2) after birth which results in long-term developmental
impacts on the lung. Approximately 70% of infants born extremely prematurely (<29 weeks’ gestational age) will
have increased pulmonary morbidity and/or early childhood wheezing disorders even though many are not
diagnosed with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). These infants are especially vulnerable to airway
hyperreactivity (AHR) after respiratory viral infections through poorly understood mechanisms. Herein, we utilize
a low-dose hyperoxia mouse model and a unique pediatric human tissue repository grounded on a new discovery
that neonatal O2 increases the abundance of lung megakaryocytes (MKs), an understudied myeloid cell biased
toward immunomodulatory functions. After respiratory viral infection, lung MKs release profibrotic cytokines such
as Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a critical inflammatory regulator and activator of transforming growth factor beta
1 (TGFβ1) that drives fibrosis. We hypothesize that neonatal hyperoxia primes the lung for AHR by increasing
the recruitment of lung MKs and predisposing MKs to release pro-fibrotic factors (e.g. TSP-1) after infection. Aim
1 will determine how the hyperoxic lung environment after birth effects lung MK recruitment and seeding including
how O2 at different developmental ages and MK depletion affect the lung MK population. Aim 2 will determine
how neonatal hyperoxia effects lung MK transcriptome before and after activation using in vitro cytokine assays
and RNAseq. Experiments will also determine if AHR is MK or TSP-1 dependent by comparing Influenza
infection models of MK-depleted mice to transgenic mice with the TSP-1 gene deleted from MKs. Aim 3 will
determine how neonatal O2 effects the bone marrow MK pool, including its effects on platelet production.
 This proposal is a five-year mentored research award and training plan for Dr. Andrew Dylag, MD to
investigate oxygen-induced mechanisms of airway dysfunction in both mice and procured human tissues. Dr.
Dylag is an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics (Neonatology) at the University of Rochester Medical Center. The
research herein builds on Dr. Dylag’s experience as a clinical neonatologist and a basic scientist interested in
O2 injury and post-hyperoxia airway hyperreactivity (AHR). As part of his career development plan, Dr. Dylag will
attain expertise through four (4) career aims: 1) Increase knowledge and technical skills in the investigation of
lung development and repair after injury using translational in vivo models, 2) Targeted training in bioinformatics
analysis including transcriptomics, 3) Develop expertise in applying in vivo laboratory discoveries to human
tissues and clinical human disease, and 4) Develop the necessary skills to lead an effective translational research
program. Dr. Dylag will attain his stated goals by applying new skills in flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry,
transcriptomics, and targeted bioinformatics training to a mouse and human tissues. At the completion of this
career development award, Dr. Dylag will have interrogated one mechanistic role of how early life O2 drives AHR,
advancing our understanding of how neonatal O2 exposures drive longer-term pulmonary morbidity."

Substance use (SU) and substance use disorders (SUD) cause extensive morbidity and mortality but have
been neglected historically by mainstream health care. The Health Systems Node joined the National Institute
on Drug Abuse’s Clinical Trials Network (CTN) in 2015, led by Drs. Campbell, Weisner and Bradley, addiction
research leaders in innovative implementation research and pragmatic trials in medical settings. Our node
includes 16 Learning Health Systems with national representation and rich population diversity, and represents
over 26 million patients. Our faculty are researchers who are embedded in their health systems and committed
to cutting-edge addiction research. They bring multidisciplinary expertise in conducting research using
innovative methods in different medical settings (e.g. primary care, addiction medicine, OB/GYN, psychiatry,
rural communities), and with diverse populations (e.g. under-represented minorities, adolescents, pregnant
women, patients with HIV). The node had an outstanding track record in its first 5 years leading 6 multi-site
studies, including the CTN’s first entirely electronic health record (EHR)-based pragmatic implementation trial
as well as participating in several studies led by other nodes. This renewal application builds upon that success
to address the CTN’s objectives over the next 5 years through 3 broad Research Agendas: 1) To test
approaches to increasing identification of SU and SUD, and engagement in treatment. For example, we
propose a multisite implementation trial to test an innovative approach to implementing cannabis and other
drug screening and assessment for SUD; 2) To test new approaches to improve SUD outcomes in medical
settings. For example, we propose a point-of-care pragmatic effectiveness trial of telephonic nurse
collaborative care and an efficacious smartphone-based SUD treatment, in patients with newly diagnosed
SUD; and 3) To develop novel measures and methods for SUD research using EHRs. For example, we
propose to validate a 7-item SU severity measure developed by the NIH Roadmap initiative Patient Reported
Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) for use in measurement-based care of SUD. These
agendas emphasize population-based studies, including pragmatic randomized controlled trials, comparative
effectiveness studies, and implementation research, and leverage EHRs. Public Health and Clinical
Practice Impact. Over 14.9 million patients with untreated SUD have health care visits annually in the US. If
10% of these patients were identified, engaged and successfully treated, it would translate to 1.5 million
patients with resolved SUD each year who otherwise would have gone untreated. The Health Systems Node
faculty and infrastructure, in collaboration with the CTN, are uniquely positioned to conduct and disseminate
research that advances the integration of SUD treatment into routine medical care, and ultimately to improve
patient outcomes and public health."

Breast cancer (BC) is a complex and heterogeneous neoplastic disease with a high incidence and mortality. BC
can be divided into clinical, histopathologic, and molecular subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)
accounts for approximately 15% of all breast cancer cases and is characterized by tumors that do not express
the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
TNBC is thought to be the most aggressive subtype and is associated with a poor prognosis, as well as a high
risk of distant recurrence and death within the first 3–5 years of follow-up. The absence of these receptors
renders TNBC resistant to treatments targeting those pathways. Thus, TNBC still remains a neoplastic disease
with unmet clinical challenges. Our laboratory has previously demonstrated an integral tumor-intrinsic role of
TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; also known as WWTR1), which is a key component of
the Hippo signaling pathway found in TNBC progression/metastasis. New preliminary data in our laboratory
indicate that tumor TAZ expression inhibits tumor progression in mouse models of TNBC cells in immune system
intact mice, thus indicating that TAZ expression also plays an underappreciated extrinsic role in TNBC biology.
We further revealed that TAZ regulates the recruitment and/or function of immune suppressive cells, such as
myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), macrophages and regulatory T cells (Tregs). The overall objective
of this proposal is to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms by which TAZ expression in tumor cells
regulates immune suppressive cells in TNBC. Our central hypothesis is that tumor TAZ expression regulates the
TME landscape via cross-talk between cancer cells with non-cancer immune suppressive cells. Our long-term
goal is to decipher TAZ regulated crosstalk between breast tumor cells and the immune components within the
tumor microenvironment (TME) to uncover new prognostic or therapeutic targets for TNBC. To achieve these
goals, we propose the following two aims: 1) To determine the impact of tumor-intrinsic TAZ expression on the
immune-TME; and 2) To understand the molecular mechanisms of TAZ expression driven immune suppressive
cells recruitment in TME. A major impact of this study is to identify previously undescribed TAZ-mediated
mechanisms that will unveil new biomarkers or inform novel therapeutic interventions for advanced TNBC."

10793374,"Tufts’ Building Diversity in Biomedical Sciences (BDBS) Program builds on a 30-year tradition of excellence in
preparing students from under-represented groups (URG) for careers in the biomedical workforce. BDBS has
an outstanding history of providing immersive summer research experiences in areas of NHLBI focus. Based
at Tufts University’s Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS), BDBS has trained 220 students in the
past 15 years, all of whom have either completed or are still enrolled in undergraduate training. Among those
who have completed college, 129 have entered health-science-related graduate programs. Another 74 have
completed their degrees and 51 remain enrolled, while only four have left the programs without a degree. In
the coming period, we will build on this high record of success using insights from current education literature
on successful training approaches for URG students in the sciences, as well as formative and summative
evaluations and other surveys. Specifically, BDBS will build on the principle that independent research in an
inclusive welcoming community improves student self-confidence, persistence and success in a science major,
and overall interest in pursuing a research career. The core of our program is a rigorous and intensive 10-week
mentored summer lab experience focused on NHLBI research. A merger of Tufts Medical School with its major
clinical affiliate permits us to increase the number of preceptors – especially those in NHLBI research (from 40
to 52), and we provide them with culturally-aware mentor training. These preceptors are clustered into seven
areas of focus, such that trainees can further learn the value of interdisciplinary collaboration in small groups.
Their lab experience is complemented by Skills Workshops for training in scientific skills that enhance self-
confidence and identity as a scientist. Lunch with a Professor and Meet the Scientist introduce trainees to the
breadth of biomedical science careers and provide career models through interactions with faculty (beyond
their own preceptor), GSBS alumni who are biomedical leaders, BDBS alumni, graduate students, post-
baccalaureate, and postdoctoral scholars. BDBS trainees are housed together close to labs and public
transportation at the Tufts University Medical School residence, building their cohort community, while social
events that include GSBS students, faculty and alumni provide a diverse and welcoming community (25% of
our PhD students are from URG compared to 11% in 2018). A novel aspect of our social events are our
STEAM-based activities (STEM+Art to inspire our trainees to creative thinking), taking advantage of the Tufts
School of the Museum of Fine Arts and an outreach program for near-peer mentoring. By achieving our aims,
BDBS gives trainees the skills and confidence needed to persist and compete effectively for advanced training
positions, and eventually to assume leadership roles in the biomedical workforce. Our record demonstrates
that BDBS is making a strong contribution toward diversifying the biomedical workforce, and we anticipate that
our new approaches will build on this strong foundation to continue enhancing diversity in the biomedicine."

This is an application for years 21-25 of NIDA's CTN Florida Node Alliance (FNA). The FNA covers Florida,
Georgia and Puerto Rico, areas of the US that continue to suffer from high rates of drug overdoses and
unceasing opioid, cocaine and methamphetamine epidemics. These areas have unmet treatment needs and
experience disparities in the implementation of evidence-based treatments. The FNA aims to build on our
record of success in leading and implementing trials in healthcare settings and integrating substance use into
mainstream of healthcare. We propose to bring to the CTN the FNA's considerable expertise in adolescent
treatment, the HIV and HCV care continua in substance-using populations, mental health comorbidities, e-
Health, data science, culturalized science, health economics, training, implementation/dissemination, and work
with Hispanic populations. The FNA's research agenda will provide scientific leadership to develop, test, and
implement interventions for the full spectrum of substance use in adolescents and adults, and strategies for the
integration of SU prevention/screening/treatment services into mainstream adolescent and adult health care.
The FNA also aims to apply our expertise in implementation science, data science, and use of electronic health
records (EHRs) to promote learning health care systems that build on precision medicine principles by
implementing and refining methods to predict individual response to treatment. Building on a foundation of
bidirectional collaboration, the FNA proposes to develop, test and implement interventions that address the
service delivery continuum in the FNA's clinical and research networks. These networks consist of SUD
treatment and general medical settings, health systems, clinical research networks, and practice-based
research networks. To achieve its aims, the FNA is proposing an innovative research agenda of concepts that
(1) integrate behavioral health and family focused interventions in pediatric care with the use of e-technologies,
(2) deliver integrative models of care for comorbid SU and HIV in hospital settings, (3) address the
comorbidities of mental health and stimulant use, (4) use EHR, registry and environmental data to improve
treatment precision, and (5) use context and culture to improve treatment outcomes. The FNA proposes to
collaborate with other Nodes on the design and implementation of CTN trials and by providing the
infrastructure and capabilities required for successful study execution. FNA network partners have
demonstrated experience in conducting point of care trials and studies that leverage the use of EHR and
claims data. The University of Miami CTSI, University of Florida CTSI, and the Georgia CTSA, will bring to the

10796940,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A critical barrier to treating Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), an autoimmune disease in which the islet beta cells are
destroyed by immune cells, is understanding the heterogeneity of disease. One source of immune
heterogeneity recently identified across recent onset T1D subjects is the presence of partially exhausted CD8
T cells in subjects with beneficial response to anti-CD3 therapy (Long, et.al Science Immunology). Likewise,
subjects with slower disease progression have great frequencies of islet-specific CD8 T cells with more
features of exhaustion. Yet, the mechanisms underlying exhaustion in T1D are not well understood. By
contrast, in chronic viral settings it is well established that the IL-2/IL-15 axis is involved in differentiation and
persistence and CD8 exhaustion: increased IL-2 availability prevents differentiation, while response to IL-2/IL-
15 is required for persistence. In T1D, we published seminal studies along with others that link alterations in
the IL-2/IL-15 axis with T1D. Here, we find that T1D subjects with lower frequencies of exhausted CD8 T cells
have higher levels of CD4 IL-2 production and lower levels of IL-15 response in CD8 exhausted cells. Thus, IL-
2/IL-15 defects associated with T1D present a unique opportunity to elucidate the role of IL-2 on CD8
exhaustion. We hypothesize that alterations in the IL-2/IL-15 axis in T1D lead to decreased
differentiation into islet-specific exhausted CD8 T cells and reduced persistence. We will test this
hypothesis in two focused aims using samples from well curated human cohorts of established T1D, pre-
clinical T1D and healthy control (HC) subjects, and multi-dimensional single cell approaches including mass
cytometry (CyTOF), RNA-seq and ATAC-seq combined with innovative systems immunology approaches. In
Aim 1, we propose to elucidate mechanisms of increased CD4 IL2 production that lead to reduced exhaustion
at different stages of disease. In Aim 2, we will elucidate mechanisms of reduced IL-12/IL-15 response in
exhausted CD8 T cells that results in limited persistence of exhaustion. Successful completion of these aims
will 1) advance our understanding of CD8 T cell exhaustion as an understudied form of tolerance in T1D, 2)
improve our understanding of immune factors contributing to T1D disease progression, and 3) provide the
foundation for the development of therapies designed to promote exhaustion."
10796941,"All eukaryotic cells produce and respond to prostaglandin (PG) signaling. PGs are lipid signaling molecules that
have a wide range of functions from inflammation to fertility to wound healing. Imbalances in PG signaling underly
many diseases, such as birth defects, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. PGs have such wide effects because
there are 5 types of PGs, and each activates multiple signaling cascades. All PGs are produced by a multistep
process that requires cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. COX enzymes are the targets of the commonly used
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin and ibuprofen. Thus, NSAIDs block all PG
synthesis and signaling. To develop more specific therapies and to better understand the functions of PGs, it is
essential to uncover the cellular roles of PG signaling. One understudied cellular function of PGs is to regulate
actin remodeling to promote collective cell migration. While over 50,000 studies have uncovered critical
regulators of cell migration, less than 60 studies have focused on the roles of PGs in this process. Thus, how
PGs regulate actin remodeling and migration remains elusive. The roles of individual PG signaling pathways,
and whether they act in the migratory cells or their substrate to coordinate cell migration are poorly understood.
Further, the specific actin regulators that are the downstream effectors of PG signaling, and how they are
modulated, are largely unknown. To overcome these knowledge gaps, we take advantage of the robust system
of Drosophila and the in vivo, collective migration of the border cells during oogenesis. In the last five years, we
found that PG synthesis in the border cells promotes on-time migration, whereas PG synthesis in the substrate
controls border cell cluster cohesion. We identified that one downstream target of PGs in both the border cells
and their substrate is Fascin. In addition to bundling actin, we found Fascin regulates the transmission of force
to the nucleus by promoting the activity of the Linker of the Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) Complex,
and the transmission of force between cells by inhibiting myosin. Using genetic, cellular, biochemical, and
biophysical approaches, the proposed studies are expected to build a new paradigm for how PG signaling, and
its effects on Fascin, coordinate the behaviors of migrating cells and their cellular substrates to promote collective
cell migration. We propose to address: 1) Which PG signaling cascades act in the migratory cells versus their
substrate to regulate collective cell migration? 2) How does PG signaling regulate Fascin? 3) What is the role of
PG signaling in LINC Complex-mediated mechanotransduction during migration? 4) How does PG signaling
control the balance of forces between the migratory cells and their substrate during collective cell migration?
Through this work, we expect to fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of how multiple PG
signaling pathways and Fascin mediate force transmission both inside cells to control nuclear dynamics and
within tissues to control collective migration. This increased understanding can be applied to develop novel
therapeutics to prevent/treat birth defects, wound healing complications, and cancer metastasis."

Oral modified-release (MR) drug products with modulated drug release characteristics (e.g., rate, duration, and
the site of drug release) have been widely used to achieve desired therapeutic effects, reduced adverse effects
and/or improved patient compliance than conventional oral solid dosage forms. More than half of the FDA
approved oral MR drug products are extended-release (ER) tablet products with multiple strengths. Until now,
appropriate factors to scale the formulation for additional strengths for oral MR tablets have yet to be determined.
Moreover, the key variables affecting drug release mechanism and formulation design spaces for different MR
technologies have not been fully understood and identified. The main objectives of this project are to: 1)
determine the impact of formulation variables (e.g., drug properties and excipients) on the drug release
mechanism of in-house made ER tablets based on quality-by-design (QbD) principles; 2) develop mechanistic
models parameterized with dissolution data obtained using comprehensive dissolution testing technologies to
compare the ER tablets and the corresponding reference drug products across multiple strengths to establish
dissolution safe spaces and to identify critical quality attributes (CQA’s); and 3) construct a “proof-of-concept”
machine learning model leveraging the database of complex oral MR drug products to identify key variables that
affect drug release mechanisms for different formulation design strategies. The proposed research builds upon
our extensive research on the formulation development, comparative product characterization, in vitro dissolution
testing as well as bioequivalence assessment and mechanistic modeling of complex oral MR solid dosage forms.
Biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) Class I and Class II compounds ropinirole hydrochloride and
nifedipine will be studied as model drugs, respectively. ER tablets across multiple strengths with formulation and
process variables will be produced and comparatively characterized using the corresponding reference drug
products as controls. The drug release mechanism and in vitro dissolution profiles of the ER tablets across
multiple strengths will be characterized under different testing conditions including fasted and fed conditions with
simulated gastrointestinal motility. Moreover, mechanistic models (e.g., physiologically based pharmacokinetic
(PBPK), physiologically based biopharmaceutics models (PBBM)-PBPK) parameterized with the in vitro data
obtained will be developed to identify appropriate factors to scale the formulation for additional strengths for oral
MR tablets. Lastly, a comprehensive database of the approved oral MR drug products will be established, and
ML techniques will be employed to identify the key variables that impact drug release mechanism. The proposed
research will help advance the regulatory review and approval processes of oral MR tablet products, and support
the approval of additional strengths for such drug products. Facilitating the development of complex generic oral
MR drug products will ultimately help increase the public access to high quality and affordable oral medications."

Rural Americans experiencing an ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) are eight times less likely to
receive timely definitive treatment than their urban counterparts. This disparity exists even after percutaneous
coronary intervention (PCI) times are adjusted for distance to the hospital and exposes rural patients to excess
morbidity and mortality. A major obstacle to timely rural STEMI care is a lack of tools available to assist
paramedics in providing a consistent evidence-based approach to prehospital STEMI. Our proposal will
translate evidenced-based rural Emergency Medical Services (EMS) STEMI best practices into a multifaceted,
digital, clinical decision support tool to address this obstacle. This study builds on our team’s foundational
mixed methods research that identified (i) previously poorly quantified complexities of rural EMS STEMI care,
(ii) barriers to timely care, and (iii) opportunities for improvement. The Rural STEMI Application will be
developed, implemented, and refined using an open-source, cross-platform mobile application developed
internally by our team. Initially, we will develop and test the usability of the Rural STEMI App in a rural North
Carolina County EMS agency to improve prehospital providers’ ability to reduce first medical contact (FMC) to
reperfusion (PCI or thrombolytic) times. This will be the first smart device application to provide real-time,
evidence-based, guideline-driven, patient-specific treatment assistance for EMS patients with STEMI. We
anticipate that the final App will incorporate specific real-time data, including EMS arrival on scene, ECG time,
map integrations of nearby emergency departments and catheterization labs, and catheterization lab
availability. This novel digital tool will assist the EMS team by providing a scene time countdown, hospital
activation metric countdowns, and EMS-specific route navigation assistance to further decrease FMC to
reperfusion time. Thus, our application will incorporate critical parameters needed to predict FMC to
reperfusion time and identify patients that are better treated with initial thrombolytic administration instead of
PCI. Through phased implementation of the Rural STEMI App in seven additional rural EMS agencies, we will
evaluate its feasibility and preliminary effectiveness to reduce FMC to reperfusion time. This application will
also address the need for improved STEMI encounter communication by providing an automatically generated
STEMI feedback report to all key stakeholders. Finally, this proposed study will be the first to apply a mixed
methods approach to characterize implementation facilitators and barriers among rural EMS agencies in the
care they provide to STEMI patients. By engaging field providers in semi-structured interviews, the study will
emphasize quality improvement efforts, EMS administration support, and interdisciplinary collaboration in the
care of EMS patients with STEMI. This proposal directly addresses a critical gap regarding how to improve
rural prehospital FMC to reperfusion times, which in turn will reduce disparities in morbidity and mortality. We
will subsequently test the Rural STEMI App in a large multisystem hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial."
10811102,"Abstract:
My laboratory is interested in studying signaling mechanisms for the regulation of neutrophil biology. Neutrophils
are a type of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and are well recognized as one of the major players during
inflammation. Although neutrophils are required for normal immune responses, they are also responsible for
many inflammation-related diseases as the effector molecules released by neutrophils are toxic to host tissues.
Mature neutrophils are known for their short lifespan (half-life is generally believed less than a day), and their
lifespan may be expanded in inﬂammatory and disease conditions. Thus, the control of neutrophil development
and lifespan can be a key step in regulating neutrophil-related functions in normal physiology as well as disease
conditions. However, not much is known about the mechanisms underlying neutrophil development and lifespan
regulation. While transcription factors like Cebpe are known to play a role in neutrophil development,
investigations into these mechanisms have been limited to individual studies. Therefore, a comprehensive
genetic screen would provide comprehensive knowledge of neutrophil development. In addition, although various
death mechanisms, particularly apoptosis, play roles in neutrophil death, their blockades only had moderate
effects, suggesting unknown mechanisms may exist. Thus, we hypothesize that there might be novel
mechanisms for the regulation of neutrophil lifespan. Primary neutrophils have a very short lifespan and are
unable to expand perpetually in vitro. Together with their being refractory to transfection or viral transduction,
neutrophils have never been used in any large-scale genetic screen in mice. The HoxB8-ER fusion protein has
been used to immortalize mouse hematopoietic progenitor cells (HoxB8-HPCs), which can differentiate into
neutrophils both in vitro and in vivo. The HoxB8-HPC-derived neutrophils were functionally similar to freshly
isolated mouse neutrophils. Because HoxB8-HPCs can be unlimited expanded and transduced with lentivirus,
they are amenable to genetic screens. In our preliminary studies, we have established Hoxb8-HPCs from a Cas9
knock-in mouse line. These cells can be transduced with lentivirus with sufficient efficiency to meet our screening
goals. We also did a pilot in vivo screen using one of the sub-libraries, which demonstrated the feasibility of our
screen strategy and method. Therefore, in this exploratory R21 proposal, we propose to perform the first
CRISPR-Cas9-based screens for key regulators that control neutrophil differentiation from HoxB8-HPCs and
lifespan of differentiated neutrophils in mice. Our proposed work will not only establish a valuable research tool
but also yield insights into neutrophil biology that cannot be predicted from existing knowledge. Importantly, the
tool we are developing and validating here can be readily adapted for screens with many other possible readouts."
10813101,"SUMMARY
Understanding the evolution of protein function is a central goal in evolutionary biochemistry. Most mechanistic
work on this problem has focused on single proteins with single functions; however, proteins often work as
members of multi-functional, multi-protein complexes. How can evolution optimize one protein function
without breaking another? How are new proteins integrated into multi-protein complexes? Answering these and
other questions requires mechanistic studies of the natural evolution of multi-functional, multi-protein
complexes.
To answer these questions, we propose studying the evolution of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)—a multi-protein,
multi-functional protein complex found in vertebrate animals. This complex is central to how animals respond
to both infection and tissue damage. It is the subject of intense interest, both from the perspective a basic biology
and as a drug target for inflammatory disorders. The complex evolved in serial over hundreds of millions of years.
In this work, we will pose—and answer—three questions: 1) How did the ability of the complex to recognize pro-
inflammatory signals change over the last 300 million years? 2) What were the evolutionary forces and processes
that led to these functional changes? 3) How did a completely new protein evolve in the ancestor of land animals
and become integrated into the complex? To answer these questions, we will employ a combination of
phylogenetic analysis, ancestral sequence reconstruction, high-throughput protein characterization,
biochemical/biophysical studies, careful functional characterization, and in vivo experiments in zebrafish.
This work will provide unprecedented understanding of the mechanisms—both biochemical and evolutionary—
that lead to new function in multi-functional protein complexes. By specifically studying the evolutionary
process that led to the human TLR4 complex, this work will also provide a lens through which we can interpret
animal model studies of innate immunity and apply their findings to human biology. And, finally, an
evolutionary approach is a powerful means to dissect how proteins work. Our results will provide deep insight
into how this important protein complex functions and can be manipulated to achieve better human health
outcomes."
10813102,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) is a dementia of language that emerges on a background of preserved
memory. It can be caused by multiple neuropathologic entities, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
frontotemporal lobar degenerations (FTLD). The one core feature of all PPA variants is the selective and
asymmetric neurodegeneration of the language-dominant (usually left) hemisphere. For the past 15 years, the
Northwestern PPA Program has enrolled patients for biennial cognitive evaluation, multimodal imaging, and
genetic characterization. Biofluids on all patients and brain tissue from those who have come to autopsy have
been banked, curated, and shared with the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the National
Centralized Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD). This cohort represents what
is arguably the world's largest registry of deeply phenotyped PPA patients. During the next cycle of this project,
PPA groups will be stratified by neuropathology rather than clinical variant. The three interactive specific aims
are to characterize neuropathology-specific fingerprints of asymmetry through multimodal imaging; to identify
neuropathology-specific correlates of neurosynaptic disruption, inflammatory markers, gene expression, and
their hemispheric asymmetry; and to explore molecular signatures of selective left hemisphere susceptibility
and memory resilience through genetic analyses. We will continue prospective enrollment into existing and
new projects and develop research methodology for single-subject rather than group studies so that individual
differences in brain organization can be taken into account. An overarching theme will be the clinicopathology
of asymmetry, which is the single universal core feature of PPA, and which offers a unique setting for
investigating the mechanisms of selective vulnerability. The innovative aspects include access to a uniformly
investigated unique PPA cohort, availability of autopsy tissue from both hemispheres so that asymmetry can
be quantitated, graph theory approaches to network architecture, genetic explorations of asymmetric
hemispheric vulnerability, and development of personalized single-subject mapping of the diseased language
network. The Northwestern PPA Research Program has made key contributions to research on the
neurobiology and cognitive characteristics of PPA by showing that the same syndrome (e.g., PPA) can be
caused by multiple neuropathologic entities, that a single disease (e.g., AD) can cause multiple syndromes,
and that clinical manifestations are determined by network anatomy rather than molecular pathology. Through
this work PPA has become a paradigmatic entity for establishing principles of pathophysiologic heterogeneity
in dementia. The aims in this proposal will help to shed additional light on the anatomical tropisms of
neurodegenerative diseases, the foundations of hemispheric asymmetry in neurodegeneration, the internal
architecture of the language network, and the mechanisms that mediate the resilience of memory function in
PPA with AD neuropathology."
10813120,"Research Summary
The prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in the U.S. is approximately 12.7% and has shown a marked
increase in recent years (Grant et al., 2017). Individuals with AUD often use cannabis, which may impact
attempts to reduce or quit drinking. In the last six years, the United States has witnessed enormous changes
concerning the public acceptance and availability of cannabis. Considering that cannabis has historically been
the drug most often used by individuals with an AUD and considering the skyrocketing increase in availability of
cannabis products, it is imperative for health care providers to understand how best to approach cannabis use
with individuals who have an AUD and who want treatment. The central premise of the proposed research is that
products with low THC and high CBD may be less harmful to AUD individuals who want to quit drinking, as
compared to products with high THC only. It is hypothesized that individuals who switch from a high THC product
to a low THC and higher CBD product will demonstrate superior outcomes compared to those individuals who
do not switch. If the hypotheses are supported, the dissemination of the research would have an immediate
effect on public health impact by educating patients and treatment providers about how to address the use of
cannabis among individuals who want to quit or reduce alcohol consumption. To that end, individuals who
currently use a high THC product and want to reduce or quit drinking will be randomly assigned to either the
control condition (continue to use your current cannabis product as you wish) or the intervention condition
(instruction to switch to low THC/high CBD product). Participants in the intervention condition choose the
product and use as little or as much as they want during the study. Participants will be tested in the Mobile
Pharmacology Laboratory at 6 and 12 week timepoints to determine the impact of these products on cue-elicited
anxiety, cue-elicited alcohol craving, drinking outcomes, and biological markers of systemic inflammation."
10813134,"Voltage sensing is found in many in biological processes and it is fundamental in excitable tissues. This project
aims at understanding the physical bases of voltage sensing and how it acts on channel opening at the molecular
level. We propose to find the structural basis of function with the following aims: AIM1. Understanding the
voltage sensor domain (VSD)-PORE energy landscape with time-dependent temperature jumps. We have
developed a method that allows for fast and homogeneous increase in temperature in the area from which
function (gating and ionic currents) and the T are measured. We will explore the energy landscape of the Shaker
K channel VSD-pore by applying T jumps at different times and voltages during the development of the gating
currents and by modifying the landscape with mutations that stabilize intermediate states, which differentially
affects a population of particular states in the energy landscape. The results will be interpreted using a structure-
based Brownian motion model of the sensor, which correlates the landscape energetic features with the VSD
structure and the physical parameters of the sensor and its medium. AIM 2. The coupling between sensor and
pore domains. Our previous findings of non-canonical coupling in Shaker is a guide to explore its relevance and
function in other channels. 2a. We will study noncanonical VSD-pore coupling in Nav1.4 sodium channel, guided
by the structures and the Shaker results by mutation of residues that may couple the four surfaces to the pore
using gating and ionic currents while searching for the origin of interdomain cooperativity. 2b. In BK, a non-
domain-swapped channel, we hypothesize that the voltage sensor move only two arginines across a fraction of
the field based on our preliminary data. To test the hypothesis we will replace arginines with histidines and look
for pores or transporters. The arginine trajectories will be inferred by replaced them by qBBR, a positively
charged fluorescent probe that is quenched by tryptophan and tyrosine in their path, as we did with Shaker. We
will test with mutations and CryoEM structures a noncanonical coupling of S4 via S5 that may gate the channel
either by acting on the selectivity filter or directly on an S6 rotation inducing dewetting. 3. VSD-Pore coupling
and Inactivation of the Sodium channel. CryoEM structures give no clear mechanistic understanding of Na
channel inactivation. We hypothesize that a docked IFM is not the inactivating particle but triggers inactivation.
We will first define the inactivation gate, that we propose is made by bulky hydrophobic residues in S6 segments
that rotate into position to obstruct conduction, based on our preliminary data where residues impair inactivation
when their volume are decreased, with possible inactivation gate restoration by methylsulfonate conjugation
when those residues are replaced by cysteine. The linker connecting the IFM motif receptor to the inactivation
is a postulated chain of residues that will be studied by mutational and CryoEM structural analysis. This research
is expected to uncover voltage sensing and pore coupling structural basis applied to understanding of
pathological conditions such as epilepsy or myotonias."
10813135,"Project Summary
Ribosomes are molecular machines composed of ribosomal RNAs and up to 80 ribosomal proteins.
These large assemblies catalyze protein synthesis in all cells. The long-term goal of this project is to
understand how eukaryotic ribosomes are assembled with the help of more than 200 non-ribosomal
factors as a series of molecular snapshots of assembly intermediates. Combining genetic, biochemical
and mass spectrometry approaches with cryo-EM is an essential step to engineer, trap, isolate and
determine atomic-resolution molecular snapshots of transient assembly intermediates of ribosomal
subunits.
Eukaryotic ribosome assembly can be subdivided into four stages, co-transcriptional assembly events
and initial maturation of small and large ribosomal subunit precursors in the nucleolus, nuclear
maturation of pre-40S and pre-60S particles, nuclear export, and cytoplasmic maturation. While late
events in eukaryotic ribosome assembly are relatively well characterized, the early assembly of
ribosomal subunits in the nucleolus is still poorly understood. Especially the mechanisms responsible
for early human small ribosomal subunit assembly have remained elusive due to a biomolecular
condensate that retains these early particles in human nucleoli.
This proposal describes new approaches to define the molecular mechanisms that govern nucleolar
maturation of the eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit. My laboratory has developed new human genome
editing and biochemical approaches that now enable us to efficiently tag and isolate early nucleolar
assembly intermediates of the human small ribosomal subunit. The synergistic use of these approaches
has allowed us to overcome previously intractable biochemical hurdles, thereby enabling the detailed
study of essential early assembly intermediates of the small ribosomal subunit.
Insights from these studies will shed light onto both the mechanisms that are employed during
eukaryotic ribosome assembly to coordinate key processing events as well as how defects in eukaryotic
ribosome assembly can result in human blood disorders, which are collectively termed
ribosomopathies."
10810905,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dry eye syndrome (DES) afflicts over 7 million Americans. DES can cause chronic and severe symptoms, leading
to visual disturbances. DES is caused by instability of the precorneal tear film (PCTF) at the surface of the eye.
While it is known that the stability of the PCTF plays a central role in DES, there is rigorous debate about what
causes PCTF instability. The tear film lipid layer (TFLL) is central to the stability of tear films. The TFLL is an
extremely thin layer of ordered lipid molecules separating the PCTF from the air. Researchers have proposed
several functions for the TFLL, including but not limited to reducing tear, preventing the collapse of the tear layer,
and providing a layer of defense against pathogens. However, it is unclear how changes in TFLL composition,
thickness, and arrangement induce PCTF instability and thinning. Several competing hypotheses naturally lead
to different strategies for treating DES. Stimulation of tear production, modulation of glandular function, and
supplementation with externally applied lipid solutions are all possible treatment routes. However, questions
about the causes of DES are difficult to answer because of lack of a detailed molecular structure of the TFLL.
Because of the TFLL’s dynamic nature, common experimental techniques are incapable of providing high-
resolution structural detail about how molecules arrange in the TFLL at the air-lipid and lipid-water interfaces.
Instead, researchers use lower resolution methods to probe composition and structure, sometimes indirectly
through model chemical compounds. However, these low-resolution techniques provide ambiguous results,
because multiple related molecular arrangements can produce the same signal. Thus, there is not a one-to-one
correlation between experimental results and molecular structures. In this study, we will generate and validate a
physiochemical computational model of the TFLL which considers the energetics of the system, and which will
be used to rationalize experimental observations about TFLL structure, function, and properties. Recent
developments in computational power allow researchers to simulate the motion of up to millions of atoms over
timescales long enough to allow the prediction of physical properties with a method called molecular dynamics.
The model begins with a description of the inter- and intramolecular forces acting on the TFLL’s components. A
virtual box of atoms is generated with a hypothetical molecular arrangement. Using classical physics, forces
between molecules are translated into motion of all atoms, and simulated snapshots of atomic positions are
collected. Analysis of these snapshots and associated energies allows the calculation of theoretical properties
that can be matched to experimental data. A successful model will match experimentally observed behavior and
provide a well-supported hypothetical TFLL structure for researchers to use for further studies. If successful, the
model developed in this work can help provide evidence for or against prevailing and competing hypotheses
about the function of the TFLL and the underlying causes of DES. Ultimately, the knowledge gained in this study
can be applied to improved design of treatments and therapeutics for DES."

Dr. Higginbotham is a promising physician-scientist who aspires to unravel the molecular pathophysiology
underlying the cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline of Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and identify novel
protein signatures that help monitor and treat these debilitating symptoms. This K23 will advance her goals by
providing training and mentorship in the following core competencies: 1) bioinformatics; 2) molecular proteomic
techniques; and 3) clinical observational research. Dr. Higginbotham has assembled a mentoring team with
unparalleled expertise in these areas and their applications to neurodegeneration research. Her primary mentor,
Dr. Allan Levey, is a world-renowned cognitive neurologist who leads a highly productive laboratory with basic
and translational expertise in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Her co-mentor, Dr. Nicholas Seyfried, is an
expert in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and Director of the Emory Integrated Proteomics Core. She
will also work closely with a host of collaborators who will provide key biospecimen and analytical resources.
This project will use a systems-based proteomics approach to globally profile the corticolimbic
pathophysiology of DLB and identify protein signatures of this dysfunction in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
The rationale for these experiments stems from a staggering lack of biomarkers that assist in the monitoring and
treatment of DLB cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline. While synuclein accumulation in corticolimbic regions
correlates strongly to these devastating non-motor symptoms, little is known regarding the complex molecular
processes surrounding this pathology. Therefore, efforts to better define the corticolimbic pathophysiology
of DLB promise to not only enhance our scientific understanding of disease, but also promote the
discovery of novel molecular signatures that advance the clinical management of its cognitive and
neuropsychiatric decline. Dr. Higginbotham has spent the last two years optimizing brain-CSF integrative
proteomic strategies in AD. This work resulted in the identification of novel CSF AD protein signatures linked to
a diverse range of cortical pathophysiology. These exciting analyses comprise much of the pilot data for this
proposal and will serve as a template for its experiments in DLB. In Aim 1, Dr. Higginbotham will apply co-
expression network analysis to the DLB corticolimbic proteome to identify key disease-associated pathways.
She will then use co-immunoprecipitation MS to examine pathological synuclein interactors in disease. In Aim 3,
she will measure protein signatures of this brain-based pathophysiology in DLB CSF. Based on preliminary data,
Dr. Higginbotham hypothesizes that the cortical and limbic regions of the DLB brain feature altered protein
pathways and synuclein interactors involved in cellular metabolism. She also expects this corticolimbic
pathophysiology to manifest in the CSF as unique DLB protein signatures that could advance our ability to
monitor and treat its cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline. This work will prepare Dr. Higginbotham to compete
for R01 funding in novel mechanistic and biomarker research in DLB and related parkinsonian disorders."

Chemistry and Pharmacology of Iboga Alkaloids
 Ibogaine is the major psychoactive alkaloid of Tabernanthe iboga, a shrub native to West Central Africa.
Since the 1960’s, ibogaine has been known for its ability to interrupt drug addiction. In light of the growing drug
use and drug overdose epidemics in the U.S., there is an urgent need for new therapeutics to treat opioid use
disorder (OUD) and other substance use disorders (SUDs) - and ibogaine represents an important prototype in
this direction. Two recent observational clinical studies confirmed the earlier reports of ibogaine’s effects that
include a rapid and long-lasting relief of opioid withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and an increased rate and
duration of abstinence in opioid-dependent subjects. The observed response size was comparable to that of
methadone replacement therapy. These clinical observations have been replicated in preclinical rodent models
of SUDs, including attenuation of self-administration of opioids, cocaine, alcohol and nicotine, mitigation of
naloxone-precipitated withdrawal symptoms, and reversal of analgesic tolerance in opioid-dependent animals. The
current mechanistic model for ibogaine invokes a role for several key molecular targets, including the a3b4
nicotinic receptor, kappa opioid receptor (KOR), and monoamine transporters. An active metabolite, noribogaine,
also makes a significant contribution to the pharmacological effects of ibogaine. We have developed new synthetic
methods for de novo synthesis of the iboga alkaloid scaffold, which unlocks unlimited exploration of its
pharmacology. We have found that substitution of the indole amine group with other heteroatoms enables
accentuation of specific mechanisms of the noribogaine pharmacological profile. The proposed research will
focus on benzofuran analogs of noribogaine (oxa-noribogaine) that represent a new class of KOR modulators.
Our preliminary results have shown that oxa-noribogaine induces a potent analgesia with no
sedative/dissociative side effects in mice, and complete and long-lasting suppression of morphine self-
administration in rats, providing a strong rationale for the proposed research. In this application, we will
explore the oxa-iboga system in terms of synthetic methods, KOR and opioid receptor pharmacology and
signaling, off-target pharmacology, in vivo target validation, and efficacy examination in rat models of
OUD. We will also explore the central hypothesis that the benzofuran iboga analogs exhibit an atypical KOR
modulator profile that underlies the favorable separation of analgesia and side effects, as well as the efficacy
in OUD models. We have assembled an interdisciplinary team with significant experience in synthetic
chemistry, computational design, opioid receptor signaling, mouse behavior, and SUD preclinical
pharmacology."

Bacterial endophthalmitis is a vision-threatening complication commonly occurring post penetrating eye injuries
and ocular surgeries. Despite aggressive antibiotics and surgical interventions, endophthalmitis often results in
partial or complete vision loss. The long-term goal of our research has been to study the pathobiology of
endophthalmitis and identify potential therapeutic targets for treatment. In our recent study (PMID: 34095879),
using transcriptomics and untargeted metabolomics, we identified several key pathways related to energy
metabolism being perturbed during Staphylococcus aureus (SA) endophthalmitis. Among these pathways, we
found that bacterial infection rapidly depletes the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) pool in the mouse
retina. NAD+ is not only crucial for oxidation-reduction reactions in the mitochondria, but metabolites of the NAD+
pathway also serve as substrates for various enzymes (e.g., PARPs, sirtuins, and CD38) to maintain cellular
homeostasis. Thus, dysregulation in NAD+ metabolism has emerged as a contributing factor in the pathogenesis
of several diseases. However, its role has not been investigated in ocular infections. Here, we propose that NAD+
depletion causes bioenergetics collapse, leading to the activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase-3
(RIPK3) mediated retinal cell death. In support, our preliminary data show disruption of the NAD+ synthesis via
salvage pathway, increased activity of CD38 NADase, and the activation of RIPK3/MLKL signaling in SA-infected
retina and cultured cells. Using a combination of mouse genetic tools, gene therapy, and pharmacological
interventions, we will determine mechanisms of NAD+ depletion and restoration of salvage pathway (Aim 1),
elucidate the crosstalk between CD38 NADase activity and RIPK3 in regulating retinal cell death (Aim 2), and
test the hypothesis whether supplementation of NAD+ precursors can be used as an adjunct therapy to treat
bacterial endophthalmitis (Aim 3). Collectively, the mechanistic insights on NAD+ dysregulation and NAD+
supplementation treatment strategies developed in this proposal could have a major impact in the field, not only
with regards to ocular infections but other systemic infectious diseases as well."
10814287,"Mechanisms of Conductive Presbycusis In Humans
Age-related high frequency hearing loss (presbycusis) is a near universally experienced condition, affecting
tens of millions of individuals in the United States alone and costing worldwide more than $750 billion per year.
Presbycusis results in difficulty understanding speech, problems hearing environmental sounds and, if
unaddressed, can lead to social isolation. Given current demographic trends, the societal burden of
presbycusis is expected to accelerate. Despite the prevalence of presbycusis, much remains unknown about
its etiologic mechanisms. Presbycusis has long been assumed to be secondary to sensorineural dysfunction,
but emerging evidence suggests conductive pathology contributes to presbycusis.
The principal method for clinical evaluation of hearing is behavioral pure tone (500-8kHz) audiometry.
Extended high frequency air conduction testing (>8kHz) is now commonly performed given new knowledge on
the role of high frequency sound for speech understanding and sound localization. Unfortunately, clinical bone
conduction testing stops at 4kHz. Above 4kHz, limitations in standard stimulus transducers that are largely
unchanged from the 1950s, and a lack of normative bone conduction standards limit study of high frequency
conductive loss. Differentiation between sensorineural and conductive presbycusis is not routinely performed,
but is of interest because: 1) prior work demonstrates discrete changes within the middle ear can lead to
isolated high frequency conductive loss (ie: with normal low-frequency thresholds) and 2) our ability to
surgically repair the middle ear. Further investigation into the prevalence and functional significance of age-
related middle ear change is necessary to ensure emerging therapies for presbycusis are appropriately
directed.
Newly developed bone conduction transducers without high frequency limitations permit comprehensive bone
conduction testing at frequencies up to 16kHz. Novel transducers will help to finally establish whether a
clinically relevant conductive or mixed presbycusis exists, shedding light on the functional effects of the aging
middle ear. Development of reliable testing for high frequency conductive hearing loss carries implications
beyond presbycusis, including post-middle-ear-surgery hearing assessment. Our goal is to identify
mechanisms of conductive presbycusis and to establish methods to reliably diagnose high frequency
conductive hearing loss. We hypothesize that a subset of patients with presbycusis have increased ossicular
compliance resulting in conductive or mixed high frequency hearing loss."
10814154,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a significant public health problem, with some three million Americans living with the
illness. Although extensive research has examined factors that facilitate or impede T1D management during
childhood and adolescence, much less is known about the high-risk time of emerging adulthood. Less than
one-third of emerging adults engage in self-management consistent with recommendations for blood glucose
checking and diet, and only 17% meet recommendations for blood glucose control, placing emerging adults at
risk for serious long-term complications. We theorize these risks occur because emerging adults are still
developing the self-regulation skills to manage T1D independently and lack the necessary social resources to
manage their illness as parental involvement declines and new relationships at work and in college occur.
There is a critical need to intervene, however, few high-quality interventions exist to address the unique needs
of emerging adults with T1D. The scientific premise is that an intervention targeting self-regulation (setting
goals, planning) and social-regulation (disclosing to others so they can provide social support) will be beneficial
for meeting the challenges of managing T1D during emerging adulthood. The research is innovative in testing
the efficacy of a theory-based intervention to target self-regulation and leverage social relationships in the daily
lives of a sample of ethnically/racially diverse emerging adults. FAMS-T1D is a newly adapted intervention
based on a highly effective intervention (FAMS-Family/friend Activation to Motivate Self-Care) developed for
adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) that involves three components: 1) phone-based coaching to improve
patients’ skills in goal pursuit and managing social relationships, 2) text messaging to patients to facilitate self-
regulation and social-regulation, and 3) text messaging to a support person (SP) to improve dialogue with and
support for the patient. The study compares the intervention to control (enhanced treatment as usual).
Extensive preliminary data of the investigative team support the need for the intervention in emerging adults
with T1D and the efficacy of the intervention for adults with T2D. In Aim 1, we evaluate the effects of the 6-
month intervention on A1c, self-management, and diabetes distress at 6-, 9-, and 12-months post baseline with
a diverse sample of 280 emerging adults and SPs recruited across two sites. In Aim 2, we examine whether
the effects on outcomes occur through improvements in patients’ reports of self-regulation (planning, self-
efficacy, self-regulation failures) and social-regulation (disclosure to others; helpful and harmful involvement of
family and friends). In Aim 3, we evaluate how the intervention improves SP reports of their involvement
without increasing SP burden. In Aim 4, we explore the time course of intervention effects on time in range
using continuous glucose monitoring data from a subsample of participants. The intervention has the potential
for high impact and broad reach as it helps emerging adults with T1D develop skills that can be leveraged in
multiple social settings, new relationships, and across other domains of life."

This is a new MPI R01 proposal bringing together protein engineering for immunotherapy
(Wittrup, MIT) with comparative oncology/veterinary medicine (Fan, UIUC) to test clinical
strategies for combining radiotherapy with intratumoral cytokine administration/retention in pet
dogs with melanoma, at the UIUC veterinary clinic. We have developed a strategy for retaining
injected cytokines (IL-2 and IL-12 in particular) in situ by expressing them as fusions to natural
collagen-binding domains. This approach has been found to be safely curative in challenging
murine transplant and GEM tumor models, and will now be advanced into a more faithful model
for human cancer: spontaneous canine melanoma. These tumors arise spontaneously in
outbred populations, and undergo a natural progression of immunoediting prior to clinical
presentation. Canine melanoma exhibits pathophysiology similar to human melanoma, including
the presence of immune infiltrated, excluded, and desert subtypes. In Aim 1, we will exploit the
more-realistic anatomy of these tumors to optimize the micropharmacokinetics of intratumoral
administration, establishing foundational principles with respect to injectable volume fractions,
needle types, and numbers of sites. In Aim 2, we will test the therapeutic hypothesis that
precisely temporally programmed intense localized cytokine stimulation can be optimally
combined with radiation therapy so as to prime a strong T cell vaccinal response with
consequent systemic impact on efficacy. In Aim 3, we will perform a clinical trial in canine
melanoma to rigorously compare alternative dose scheduling for intratumoral cytokine therapy
following irradiation. We hypothesize that the time delay prior to cytokine injection will have a
critical, all-or-nothing effect on outcomes. This intradisciplinary collaboration has commenced,
and exciting preliminary treatment data is presented herein.
The overarching objective of this project is to develop improved human cancer immunotherapy
protocols that combine intratumoral immunotherapy with local radiation. Multiple previous
clinical trials in this area have yet to realize the full promise of this approach, but by performing
rapid design-build-test-learn cycles in spontaneous canine melanoma, we hope to converge
more efficiently to efficacious strategies."
10814245,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are one the most proliferative and abundant cell types in the central
nervous system (CNS). During development, OPCs widely dispersed into areas of gray matter or white matter,
and readily differentiate to give rise to oligodendrocytes, which are responsible for insulating neuronal axons with
myelin. Studies in mouse models have revealed that abnormal development of OPCs and oligodendrocytes is
one of the underlying causes of neurological diseases and disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
multiple sclerosis (MS), and glioblastoma, the deadliest of brain cancers. Currently, it is unknown how OPCs are
regulated to populate the gray matter (GM) or white matter (WM), and what mechanisms are responsible for
selectively maintaining many OPCs in undifferentiated state while others mature into oligodendrocytes. Prior
studies demonstrate that the transcription factor, ASCL1, is differentially expressed in OPCs, where it is relatively
higher in WM-OPCs than in GM-OPCs. Experiments outlined in this proposal are designed to test the overall
hypothesis that the level of ASCL1 specifies the fate of OPCs and determines their homing and
properties in the GM or WM. To test this hypothesis, the proposed study will pursue the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1. To determine if a sustained high level of ASCL1 is responsible for specifying OPC fate and
homing to WM over GM in the brain.
Specific Aim 2. To identify functionally relevant genetic targets of ASCL1 specifically in OPCs using ChIP-seq
and Ribo-Tag.
Specific Aim 3. To determine if Cntn1, a novel target of ASCL1 that encodes for a cell surface protein, functions
downstream of ASCL1 to mediate the homing of OPCs to the WM.
Both ASCL1 and CNTN1 are essential for OPC development, proper myelination, and glioma progression and
metastasis. We anticipate that completion of this study will offer new mechanistic insights into how
OPC/oligodendrocyte related pathological conditions such as demyelination, neuronal degeneration, and
cancers arise in the CNS, while at the same time also provide an entry point to potentially manipulate these cells
for the treatment of these debilitating diseases."
10812937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Those at-risk for BD and diagnosed with BD demonstrate significant positive emotion dysregulation (PED), and
that PED is related to the severity of illness, functional outcomes, and comorbid conditions. Evidence strongly
suggests that PED is central in BD and predicts maladaptive risk-taking behaviors, placing it as a top NIMH
priority. PIs Gruber, Johnson and others have provided robust empirical support for PED in at-risk and clinically
diagnosed BD populations over 15 years, including dozens of laboratory studies. Prior work, though, has not
established whether PED predicts the onset of BD, nor the progression of symptoms during early phases of the
disorder. This project will use multi-modal behavioral and neuroimaging approach to provide evidence of the
import of PED to BD risk across three groups over a longitudinal 24-month period, including emerging adults
with early onset of BD disorder, those at high risk but not yet diagnosed with BD, and those at low risk for BD.
Of import, we will conduct novel work to examine how PED can predict initial onset of BD among emerging
adults and can predict the course of BD among the high risk and the early onset groups. We will focus on
emerging adults as the age group with the highest risk of mood onset and functioning difficulties. We will recruit
a large, diverse community sample, and we will identify those at high and low risk for BD using a well-validated
risk indicator, and we will use diagnostic interviews to assess BD diagnoses. Participants in all three groups
will complete a multi-modal laboratory assessment of PED, including behavioral and neural indices. We will
test the predictive value of these processes across a 24-month longitudinal follow-up of the high-risk group and
the early onset group. Accordingly, this proposal has three specific aims: Aim 1: PED and Behavioral
Mechanisms: Extend well-established behavioral findings of elevated PED in the BD early-onset > BD high-
risk > BD low-risk groups. AIM 2: PED and Neural Mechanisms: Employ a well-validated fMRI task to assess
dynamic neural processes associated with positive emotion reactivity and emotion regulation, to show (a)
greater magnitude of neural signature for emotion reactivity (b) diminished magnitude of neural signature for
emotion regulation, and (c) and diminished task-based functional connectivity between the PFC and parietal
regions during emotion regulation across the early-onset BD, high-risk BD and low-risk BD groups. AIM 3. PED
and Associations with BD Onset and Illness Course: Establish the predictive value of PED-relevant
behavioral and neural processes predict onset of BD in the high-risk group and predict mania symptom
severity in the BD high-risk and BD early-onset groups across a 24-month longitudinal period. This project fits
with NIMH goals of integrating basic research with clinical science to enhance outcomes for those with mental
illness."

Candidate’s Long-term Career Goal: To become an independently funded physician-scientist developing
and testing patient-centered interventions to support shared decision making (SDM) in chronic esophageal
diseases.
Research Context: As a chronic disease with rapidly rising prevalence, incidence, healthcare costs, and
burdens to patient quality of life, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an understudied, challenging area of care for
both patients and providers that requires support in education, decision making, and communication around
complex treatment choices to prevent costly complications. As clinical equipoise exists between medication
and dietary therapies, understanding stakeholder drivers of decision making and applying SDM are critical
gaps in patient-centered EoE care, and are needed to improve long-term disease outcomes.
Candidate Background and Achievements: Dr. Chang is an Instructor in Gastroenterology at the University
of Michigan (UM) and an awardee of a Consortium of Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Disease Researchers grant.
She received her MD from the University of Maryland and MS from UM. To date she has published 13 original
peer-reviewed manuscripts and one book chapter, 10 of which she is first or senior author.
Career Development Plan: Dr. Chang proposes to develop new expertise in mixed methods, advanced
qualitative research methods, decision sciences, and clinical trial conduct and evaluation to assess the impact
of a decision support intervention on outcomes. Her career development goals are supported by stellar
mentorship, advanced didactic coursework, and participation in workshops and professional meetings
designed to foster collaboration, ensure successful study completion, and support her seamless transition into
a successful independent researcher.
Aims: 1) Elicit the multilevel factors that influence decision making for EoE management among patients and
providers, 2) Develop a multilevel decision support intervention prototype that supports SDM for selection of
EoE therapy, and 3) Pilot test and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary patient-reported efficacy
outcomes associated with use of the decision support intervention.
Research Plan: Dr. Chang will 1) use a mixed methods design to interview patients with EoE to identify factors
that drive treatment decision making, 2) conduct qualitative interviews of gastroenterologists and allergists to
characterize provider perspectives about EoE management and supported decision making, 3) develop a
multilevel decision support intervention to facilitate SDM between patients and providers, and 4) assess
decision intervention feasibility, acceptability, and influence on preliminary efficacy outcomes comparing 20
patients receiving decision support to 20 patients receiving control content."

 Quiescent TCF1Hi stem-like CD8 T cells – functionally poised to rapidly expand and mount a vigorous
anti-viral immune response – are critical for mediating effective viral control while avoiding immunopathology
during chronic viral infections. The phenotypic, functional and molecular features of TCF1Hi stem-like CD8 T cells
are well characterized. However, very little is known about the precise signals that drive their generation. The
overarching goals of this proposal are to (i) define how the long-term pool of TCF1Hi stem-like anti-viral CD8 T
cells is generated during chronic viral infections, and (ii) leverage this knowledge for devising strategies to
engineer conceptually novel checkpoint blockade and adoptive cell transfer therapies in situations where
viral/antigen persistence drives functional exhaustion and loss of host immunity.
 This proposal is founded on newly published and unpublished findings from our team showing a critical
and unexpected role of tempered IL-2 signals in the development of TCF1Hi stem-like CD8 T cells during chronic
viral infection. Our preliminary studies further show that IL-2 production by virus-specific CD8 T cells is inversely
related to PD-1 signals during priming. Additionally, we and others have shown that loss of PD-1 signals leads
to metabolic dysregulation and impaired survival of antiviral CD8 T cells that are key to long-term viral control.
Collectively, these findings present a unique role of the PD-1/IL-2 nexus during early T cell priming, in
programming the development of TCF1Hi stem-like CD8 T cells, for long-term maintenance of host anti-viral
responses. We hypothesize that PD-1-driven regulation of IL-2 production during priming promotes the
development of stem-like quiescent CD8 T cells. We further propose that mechanisms that promote inhibitory
PD-1 signals and temper IL-2 signals to CD8 T cells, during early T cell priming and initiation of anti-viral host
immune responses, would lead to the generation of TCF1Hi stem-like CD8 T cells with enhanced potential for
functional rejuvenation and viral control in response to checkpoint blockade.
 We will engage high dimensional single cell transcriptomic, metabolomic and proteomic tools along with
leading edge RNP-based in vivo Crispr/Cas9 technology and conditional gene ablation models to: (1) Dissect
the programming of TCF1Hi stem-like CD8 T cells during early stages of chronic viral infections through the PD-
1-driven IL-2 regulatory axis. (2) Explore novel preconditioning strategies to enhance TCF1Hi stem-like cells
during established chronic viral infections for improved PD-1 checkpoint blockade through g-chain cytokines. (3)
Establish the relationship between IL-2 signaling signatures and stem-like T cells, vis a vis clinical outcomes of
checkpoint blockade, for Polyoma virus-specific exhausted CD8 T cells in human patient samples.
 Successful completion of these studies will provide fundamental insight into the ontogeny of stem-like
TCF1Hi cells, alongside translational advances into discovery of newer druggable targets for improved control of
chronic viral infections."
10785932,"Using Mobile Technology and Real-World Vocalization Samples to Generate Quantitative Metrics of
Vocal Communication for Minimally-Speaking Individuals
Over one million individuals remain minimally-speaking past the age of 5, often communicating through
vocalizations that contain little to no speech. Yet, little is known about the vocal communication of profoundly
affected minimally-speaking individuals. Current speech and communication metrics are often normalized
based on typically-developing individuals and fail to adequately capture the skills of minimally-speaking
individuals. Moreover, measures that are designed for this population are generally qualitative, relying on
caregiver reports or examiner observations from a short clinical visit. The lack of quantitative communication
measures that map how vocalizations from minimally-speaking individuals develop over time has profound
consequences for researchers, clinicians, families, and the individuals themselves. The lack of quantitative
communication measures designed for this population has profound consequences for researchers, clinicians,
families, and the individuals: Clinical trials have failed to advance because the outcome measures did not
capture the subtle changes in participants’ development, and families of minimally-speaking individuals
consistently list communication as one of their top research priorities. This proposal aims to generate a
sensitive, quantitative metric of vocal communication for minimally-speaking individuals by tracking their
phonological vocalization complexity over time. To achieve this aim, I will enroll n=90 individuals (ages 6-35
years, enrolled equally over the age range) with fewer than 50 spoken words using a smartphone app I
previously developed and deployed. This app allows caregivers to record a vocalization and label its meaning
with the tap of a button in their homes and natural environments. Caregivers will be prompted to elicit and
record as many vocalizations as possible during daily ten-minute intervals for one week every six months for
two years. Using this unique database of real-world vocalizations, I will characterize the complexity of vocal
communication across and within individuals over time (Aims 1 and 2) and will examine how this metric relates
to established assessments (Aim 3). I will also explore acoustic-based metrics that capture vocalization
complexity in an objective and scalable manner. The results of this work will allow us to determine sensitive
vocal communication milestones for profoundly affected minimally-speaking individuals and appropriate
outcome measures for clinical trials and interventions."
10799065,"Project Summary/Abstract
Photoreceptors consume glucose rapidly because they derive about half of their
metabolic energy from the inefficient process of aerobic glycolysis. The retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) is the blood barrier for the outer retina, so glucose from the circulation
must pass through it to reach the retina. The ability of the RPE to transport and recycle
fuel is essential for homeostasis of the outer retina. Deficiencies in its functions caused
either by genetics, by environment factors or by aging cause vision loss.
Whereas photoreceptors extract energy from glucose by aerobic glycolysis, the
metabolic features of the RPE are complementary. The RPE uses its mitochondria to
minimize its own consumption of glucose, presumably so that more glucose can pass
through it to reach the retina.
Research on retina and RPE metabolism has focused mostly on the immediate use of
fuels. However, cells also store metabolic energy, either as glycogen or as fat. RPE cells
have both, but we do not know yet how depots of glycogen and fat contribute to normal
retina and RPE metabolism and homeostasis.
The metabolic relationships between the retina and RPE vary throughout day. We will
use both ex vivo and in vivo strategies to quantify diurnal changes in metabolic flux and
energy storage in RPE/choroid tissue. In the first aim we will identify diurnal influences
on glycogen metabolism. In the second aim we will identify diurnal influences on fatty
acid metabolism and in the third aim we will evaluate effects on stored fuels of mutations
that cause photoreceptor degeneration and that disrupt RPE phagocytosis.
Understanding how the metabolic state and the source of energy, either from blood or
from fuels stored in the RPE, may vary with a diurnal or circadian cycle may in future
studies be used to develop metabolism-based strategies that make photoreceptors more
resilient to stress."
10799458,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 12 million Americans currently live with both obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), putting them in one
of the highest risk groups for developing serious microvascular and macrovascular complications. The Ameri-
can Diabetes Association’s clinical practice guidelines recommend metabolic/bariatric surgery (MBS) and/or
pharmacologic treatment of obesity for patients with obesity and T2D. In particular, glucagon-like peptide-1 re-
ceptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) have both demonstrated
efficacy in weight loss and preventing microvascular and macrovascular complications and are more accessi-
ble than MBS. However, there are no long-term studies comparing GLP-1RAs or SGLT2is with MBS head-to-
head with respect to effectiveness and safety, overall and in groups disproportionately affected by obesity and
T2D but underrepresented in clinical trials such as racial and ethnic minority populations and rural residents.
There is a clear and urgent need for large, real-world comparative effectiveness research studies to help pa-
tients and their clinicians make evidence-informed decisions regarding the risks and benefits of surgical and
medical approaches to reduce the long-term complications of concurrent obesity and T2D. We propose a com-
parative effectiveness and safety study using administrative claims and linked electronic health record data on
a diverse nationwide cohort (~40% racial/ethnic minority) of >500,000 patients with T2D and obesity treated
with MBS, GLP-1RA, or SGLT-2i from 2010 to 2025, encompassing patients covered in commercial, Medicare
Advantage, and 100% of Medicare fee-for-service plans. Our specific aims will compare the effectiveness of
GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is versus MBS in improving metabolic outcomes (weight, blood pressure, and hemoglo-
bin A1c), reducing rates of micro- and macrovascular disease, and all-cause mortality among patients with obe-
sity and T2D. We will also compare the safety of GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is versus MBS among patients with
obesity and T2D by examining rates of all-cause hospitalizations and by exploring other safety outcomes
(emergency department care, severe hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, acute
kidney injury, and severe genitourinary infections). A prospective randomized trial investigating these questions
would be prohibitively expensive and logistically challenging to conduct given the high costs of these treat-
ments and the very large sample sizes needed to examine incident micro- and macrovascular outcomes, par-
ticularly in high priority patient subgroups. Our proposed study will be the largest and longest study to date
comparing the real-world effectiveness and safety of GLP-1RA, SGLT-2i, and MBS to manage obesity and
T2D while also generating evidence for subgroups that are often underrepresented in clinical trials. The study
will provide timely and rigorous comparative effectiveness and safety evidence to help inform clinical decisions."

Due to advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART), the vast majority of youth living with HIV (YLH) in the US
now survive to adulthood, and, thus, must transition from pediatric to adult HIV care. Achieving a successful
transition to adult HIV care is a pressing public health issue with implications for ongoing efforts to end the
HIV epidemic in the US. During the pediatric-to-adult HIV care transition (“HCT”), youth must navigate
forming new relationships with providers and taking on greater independence in their care. Challenges to a
successful HCT also vary by geographic location and sociocultural context. As one of the rural states targeted by
the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative, South Carolina (SC) is characterized by profound HIV
disparities among racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minority communities, as well as high rates of poverty,
structural barriers to healthcare, and healthcare provider shortages. While there have been some attempts to
characterize such transition in other southern states with high HIV burden, data regarding the status of HCT of
YLH and barriers and facilitators of a successful HCT are still limited, largely because of some gaps in the
existing research (e.g., with data predominately from YLH with perinatal acquisition, qualitative or
quantitative studies with small sample sizes and short follow up time). To address the gaps in HCT research
among YLH, we will build a longitudinal cohort (estimated ~6,000) of youth (13 to 24 years of age) who were
diagnosed with HIV during 2005-2023, extract and link their electronic health records (EHR) data from six SC
state agencies, and link these data to aggregated county-level community and social structural level data from
multiple publicly available data sources to develop a robust, multi-faceted dataset with biological, clinical,
behavioral, and contextual variables. With the integration of multilevel data from multiple sources and
advanced data analytics (e.g., machine learning algorithms), the current study will assess the HCT status (e.g.,
successful, delayed, or loss/failure in transition) and post-transition care continuums (e.g., retention in adult
care, viral suppression in adult care) among YLH over time, and identify the barriers and facilitators of success
HCT for YLH. This study will provide an in-depth assessment of the HCT status of a large longitudinal cohort
of YLH in SC using real world data. Identification of the barriers and facilitators for successful HCT of YLH
could help policymakers and HIV care providers improve systems and services to better support YLH as they
move from pediatric to adult-oriented HIV care and inform state health department to devise more precise,
targeted intervention strategies for YLH to maintain continuous engagement in care during the transition, to
support the ability of YLH to effectively manage their disease, and ultimately to decrease HIV-related
morbidity and mortality rates among these youth, especially those who are minoritized."

Growing evidence supports that exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors during the prenatal and
early childhood periods adversely affect perinatal and child health, with potential lifelong health consequences
for mothers and offspring. In the United States chemical and non-chemical stressor exposures and
adverse health outcomes occur disproportionately to African American families, highlighting that
disparities begin in utero and become amplified postnatally, and underscoring the importance of
representation of this vulnerable population in environmental epidemiology cohort (EEC) research that
spans the life course. Among outcomes disproportionately experienced by African American families are
adverse perinatal health outcomes (e.g., cardiometabolic complications of pregnancy, preterm birth, small-for-
gestational age), neurodevelopmental delays, and obesity – all of which have been linked to environmental
exposures yet remain poorly understood, and poorly targeted by preventive measures, due to etiologic
complexity, the lack of biomarkers to indicate impactful exposures and/or individual susceptibility, as well as
the insufficient engagement of environmental health scientists who share cultural background with members of
affected communities in research. With NIH support, our team has established a socioeconomically diverse,
well-phenotyped African American maternal-child EEC that enrolls mothers during early pregnancy and
extends dyad follow-up through early childhood to investigate prenatal toxicant and stress exposures, along
with the microbiome, epigenome, and metabolome, on perinatal and child health outcomes. We have enrolled
700 mother-child dyads. with prenatal toxicant exposures and rates of preterm birth substantially higher than
US rates. We have employed cohort data to delineate: the role of prenatal exposures to persistent and non-
persistent chemical mixtures and chemical-psychosocial stressor mixtures in adverse birth outcomes; maternal
metabolic perturbations that associate with environmental exposures and adverse birth outcomes; the role of
maternal adversity in epigenetic age acceleration and emotional reactivity in offspring (highlighting
intergenerational impacts of exposure); and growing concern among the community about toxicant exposures
from personal care product use. To advance both environmental health science and workforce diversification,
we propose to expand: 1) enrollment and longitudinal follow-up of African American mother-child dyads, with
enrollment in a key window of susceptibility (pregnancy); 2) data collection to include measures of
environmental health equity (area-level deprivation, segregation, air pollution) and environmental injustice
(metabolic signatures of bio-transformed metabolites of personal care products used by African American
women) for inclusion in analytic models of risk for adverse perinatal health outcomes under the ‘stress-
exposure disease’ framework; and 3) engagement with early stage investigators of the Morehouse School of
Medicine NIEHS-supported Frontiers in Environmental Science and Health (FrESH) training program."

The rapidly increasing number of antibacterial-resistant pathogens and the emergence of new infectious threats
underscore the desperate need for novel antimicrobial therapeutics at a time when the pharmaceutical industry
has largely abandoned this area of research and development. Academic research institutions have begun to
meet this need, but success will require scientists who are trained to apply the techniques of chemical biology to
the study of microbial pathogenesis. The Chemical Biology of Infectious Diseases (CBID) Training Program
exploits Vanderbilt’s strengths in chemical biology and microbiology and prepares scientists for the challenges
of antimicrobial target identification and drug discovery. Twenty-eight faculty preceptors from seven departments
in both Vanderbilt University and Vanderbilt University Medical Center serve as mentors for the Program. Four
predoctoral students will be selected each year to receive two years of support during their second and third year
of study in the five-year program. Highlights of the training program include formal coursework in both microbial
pathogenesis and chemical biology, elective courses for specialized training, a “mini-sabbatical” research
opportunity in a collaborator’s laboratory, research and professional development workshops, an interactive
seminar series in chemical biology, an annual research symposium in chemical biology, participation in the
infectious disease case conference and antibiotic stewardship program, an in-depth laboratory research
experience, and an external internship at a major pharmaceutical company. Research projects emphasize a
multi-disciplinary approach that applies chemical biology to the study of microbiology, and students are advised
by at least two CBID preceptors. As a result, students who complete the CBID Training Program are well-
grounded in a core discipline and sufficiently well-trained in complementary fields to allow them to work effectively
in an interdisciplinary environment."

Neurons in the central amygdala (CeA) contribute to pain modulation. However, their contribution to the sensory-
discriminative and/or emotional-affective dimensions of chronic pain, nor their neurochemical modulation, are
understood. Our preliminary data using slice recordings and behavior provide a compelling premise for the idea
that drugs targeting the receptors for the bioactive lysophospholipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) act within
the CeA to inhibit inflammatory and neuropathic pain. This sets the stage for our long-term goal to understand
how lipid signaling controls the supraspinal control of acute and chronic pain. The objectives of this proposal are
to: determine neurophysiological changes to molecular specific CeA neurons in multiple models of pain (Aim 1),
elucidate the effects of S1P signaling on the intrinsic and synaptic excitability of defined subpopulations of CeA
neurons (Aim 2), and determine if S1PR agonism in the CeA is analgesic in models of inflammatory and
neuropathic pain (Aim 3). In Aim 1, we use transgenic mouse lines, electrophysiology, and optogenetics to test
the hypotheses that tissue or nerve injury reduces excitability of specific subclasses of CeA neurons based on
their molecular profile. In Aim 2, we test the hypotheses that activation of S1P signaling increases the excitability
and synaptic connectivity within a population of molecularly distinct CeA neurons. In Aim 3, we use intracranial
drug infusions and chemogenetics to test the hypothesis that activation of S1P receptors in the CeA attenuates
inflammatory and neuropathic pain via a specific subtype of CeA neuron. Experimental support of these concepts
will facilitate the development of existing (e.g. FDA-approved fingolimod) and novel S1PR compounds for the
treatment of chronic pain."

Black, Latino, and Native American students fall far behind their White and Asian counterparts in
representation within science employment and academic programs. This disparity is especially noticeable
within the ethnically-diverse California Bay Area that is rich in biomedical and engineering opportunities.
Similar to other parts of the country, students of color are consistently underrepresented. For example, in 2013,
11% of the U.S. workforce was Black but only 6% of those employed in science jobs were Black. In
comparison, White and Asians are 3-times more likely to be employed in science jobs compared to the
domestic workforce. Despite decades of legislation and policy changes, these statistics have changed
minimally over 30 years. Since its founding, Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute (CHORI) has set
addressing these disparities in our community as a mission objective. To that end, CHORI created a Summer
Student Research Program (SSRP) nearly four decades ago to promote diversity in biomedical training by
providing a short-term, one-on-one mentored research experience to underrepresented students with potential
to significantly contribute to a culturally-representative scientific research workforce. For 38 years, we have
secured uninterrupted funding to develop this program while continuing to expand and improve by adding
training and experiences that will appeal to the modern student. The next innovation we call STIMULUS –
Science & Technology IMmersion for Underrepresented Learners in the US – seeks to utilize the R25
mechanism to support 18 undergraduate or health professional students each year for the next five years. With
STIMULUS, the existing program infrastructure will be upgraded to strengthen our curriculum to better match
the diversity of the students and evolving needs of the scientific marketplace. This multi-faceted proposal
provides many enhancements, including a new collaboration with the University of California Berkeley, School
of Bioengineering, more comprehensive training workshops, expanded recruiting from regional pipeline
programs and historically black colleges, formalized program for near-peer mentoring, enhanced alumni
tracking and evaluation, and an innovative case-based approach for bioethics education. We expect these
program enhancements will allow us to reach more under-represented students and have a longer-lasting
impact on the selected students to pursue a career in biomedical or clinical research by stimulating their
interest, arming them with practical professional development skills, and increasing their confidence in science,
thereby improving their likelihood of success in the Science Technology Engineering Math (STEM) workforce."

The scope of this study is to engage Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) funded organizations in Ending
the HIV Epidemic (ETHE) areas in the South/East US to co-develop context-responsive programs utilizing evi-
dence-informed interventions to reduce structural racism and discrimination (SRD) against Black, Indigenous,
People of Color (BIPOC) living with HIV (PLH) and BIPOC healthcare workers. SRD directly impacts access to
and uptake of healthcare for BIPOC, including engagement in HIV services across the continuum of prevention
and care. The proposed intervention, titled TRAnscenDS, draws on the evidence-based Health Policy Plus
(HP+) ‘total’ facility HIV stigma-reduction intervention and Contact Theory, which have demonstrated efficacy
in reducing race-related intergroup prejudice. TRAnscenDS targets the clinics’ organizational (e.g., anti-racist
and diversity, equity and inclusion [DEI] policies) and systems (e.g., staff attitudes/behaviors) levels to affect
patient (e.g., experienced and perceived discrimination, HIV care, mental health) outcomes and staff (e.g., job
satisfaction) wellbeing, at the individual level. In Aim 1, we will rigorously select 6 clinics from ETHE areas evi-
dencing full commitment to dismantling SRD (mos 3-9). In Aim 2, after a baseline assessment (N=180; mos
11-12), we will conduct a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of the SRD reduction intervention. At each of
the 3 steps, two randomized clinics will receive TRAnscenDS. The intervention will support clinics to 1) identi-
fy/create organizational-level anti-racist policies and practices (e.g., clear definitions of racist behavior, ade-
quate training and monitoring systems, and prompt responses for constructive redress) to reduce SRD and
increase race-based equity for BIPOC patients and provider/staff, and 2) deliver race-specific trainings to all
staff (e.g., history of SRD, health consequences of bias and discrimination, cultural humility, intersectional dis-
crimination at the confluence of race, ethnicity, sexuality and gender). Each cluster will receive the intervention
for 6 mos, starting with Cluster Group 1 (mos 13-18), followed by Cluster Groups 2 (mos 19-24) and 3 (mos
25-30). In Aim 3, we will evaluate multi-level outcomes using the CFIR, including within the organization (pri-
mary outcome of SRD Index – ratings of mission/vision statements, anti-racist policy, workforce diversity, equi-
ty and inclusion [DEI], clinic environment), systems (secondary outcomes of provider/staff attitudes; behavior;
DEI indicators), and individual patient level (tertiary outcomes of clinic-level HIV indicators, reports of discrimi-
nation, medical distrust, anxiety, depression, and trauma) outcomes. Assessments will take place every 6
months, with the clinics randomized to the second or third step having multiple assessments before the inter-
vention (with final data collection being in month 49). BIPOC patients at the clinics will be surveyed at each as-
sessment (N=2,100). Findings will yield a manual for implementing total-facility SRD-reduction processes and
content (mos 52-60). Other RWHAP-funded clinics and facilities serving marginalized groups may be able to
adopt this manualized, yet highly adaptable intervention packet to support BIPOC."
10819561,"Millions of people worldwide suffer vision loss from progressed stages of age-related macular degeneration
and retinitis pigmentosa. Through the disease, much of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and many
photoreceptors are irreversibly lost and new cutting edge treatments using trophic factors or gene therapy are
ineffective because the tissues are no longer present to be rescued. Our goal is to remediate vision loss
through transplantation of retinal progenitor tissue sheets into the degenerated retina. In rodent models of
retinal degeneration (RD), several studies have demonstrated that retinal progenitor sheets successfully
integrate into the host retina, through synaptic connectivity between the transplant retina and host, and evoke
responses to flashes of light in the superior colliculus (SC, a midbrain visual nucleus and direct target of retinal
ganglion cells). However, in order to determine the complexity and quality of visual information provided by the
transplant visual responsivity must be determined at a greater level of detail and in structures such as higher
visual cortex where more complex visual processing occurs.
 Our main hypothesis is that transplants of fetal- and hESC-derived retinal progenitor sheets will
drive complex and specialized visual responses in visual cortex (Aims 1 and 2), as well as visually guided
behavior, and, that feedforward and feedback cortical circuitry at the level of specific neuronal cell types will be
more similar to normal rats than RD rats without transplants (Aim 3). These studies will be performed using two
rat models that are effectively blind by 3 months of age - through a collaboration combining visual
neurophysiology expertise and cutting edge neural circuit tracing using genetically modified rabies viruses from
the PI with the unrivaled surgical skills for retinal sheet transplantation and expert breeding knowledge of
transgenic RD rats by the CO-PI.
 This project directly addresses the NEI Audacious Goals Initiative to regenerate the eye and visual
system."

Despite improvements in medical management, hypertension still affects >25% of adults, and 20 to 30% of
them are resistant to pharmacological treatment. Similarly, heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction
continue to exhibit dramatically reduced life expectancy, frequent hospitalization, and overall poor quality of
life. Chronic electrical stimulation of the baroreflex at the carotid sinus—known as baroreflex activation therapy
(BAT)—is FDA-approved to mitigate the marked sympathetic activation associated with both hypertension and
heart failure. BAT was demonstrated in multiple controlled clinical trials to produce sustained significant
improvements in both hypertension and heart failure outcomes in patients non-responsive to traditional medical
management; however, the therapy is limited by side effects. We propose an integrated approach to mitigate
side effects and thereby improve the therapeutic efficacy of BAT.
We seek to determine the functional neuroanatomy responsible for the side effects of BAT and to use these
data to design and test approaches for more effective BAT neural interfaces. These optimized designs will
expand the therapeutic window between baroreceptor activation and limiting off-target effects. The outcomes
of this project will produce an optimized BAT interface design that could be quickly translated to address a
clear clinical need. In addition, we will provide a needed framework for incorporation of local neural and tissue
anatomy—which govern therapy-limiting side effects—into the neural interface design process that can be
readily applied to myriad neuromodulation therapy targets."

The Mayo Clinic Immunology Ph.D. Training Program seeks to train leaders for the next generation of
immunologists. This training grant proposal requests support for 6 pre-doctoral students who will be trained in
a productive biomedical research program supported by a premier academic not-for-profit medical institution.
The highly productive training faculty provide a rich training environment with basic and clinical investigators
combining studies of fundamental immunology with translational potential. The training program has an
exemplary track record in preparing students to succeed in scientific careers. Of all students who have
successfully completed our Ph.D. Training Program , 98.9% have remained in science, science-related fields
or medicine. 54.9% of those graduates currently hold academic rank, a rate almost twice the national average.
Students in the program receive advanced training in primary literature and cutting edge technology focused
coursework and electives in a multidisciplinary setting. Milestones in the program place emphasis on each
trainee mastering the skills needed to formulate critical questions, and devising experimental strategies to
provide definitive insights into the questions being addressed. Students learn to communicate ideas and
research findings effectively using oral and written formats and practice these skills in classroom settings, in
grantsmanship courses, at national and international scientific meetings, and by publishing original research
articles in scientific journals. The typical training period for trainees supported by this grant is 5.2 years, capped
by mentoring for the next phases of their developing careers."

C→G) in the human patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene, which results in isoleucine
(I) to methionine (M) substitution at amino acid 148, as the most significant gene variant associated with a broad
spectrum of ALD ranging from steatosis, hepatitis, to cirrhosis to date. PNPLA3 is a lipid droplet-associated
protein that is most abundantly expressed in human liver, which has been shown to have triglyceride lipase and
retinyl palmitate hydrolase activities. However, the pathophysiology of the 148M variant of PNPLA3 in the liver
remains largely unclear. In this project, we have developed transgenic mouse models for both variants of human
PNPLA3 and validated the key features of human ALD in the 148M mouse model. We aim to further address the
molecular underpinning of the 148M mutation in the alcohol-induced hepatic inflammation and fibrosis using both
cell and animal models. It is expected that the mechanistic investigation in this application will provide direct
evidence of the causal relationship between the 148M variant and the associated liver pathology. Altogether, we
believe that this project is highly significant and innovative."

 Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a progressive multi-system disease of women characterized by
cystic lung destruction, renal angiomyolipomas, and chylous pleural effusions. Lymphangiogenesis is prominent
in pulmonary LAM nodules and serum VEGF-D levels above 800 pg/ml are a diagnostic biomarker of LAM. The
majority of LAM cells carry bi-allelic inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes and
circulating LAM cells with TSC2 loss of heterozygosity can be detected in the blood.
 The TSC protein complex inhibits the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTORC1) via the
small GTPase Rheb. mTORC1 acts as a molecular sensor that regulates cell growth, metabolism, autophagy,
and microRNA biogenesis. Pivotal clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefit from treatment with sirolimus
(Rapamycin) or its analogs (Rapalogs) in LAM and TSC. Collectively these data indicate that Rapamycin is an
effective suppressive therapy for LAM. However, lung function decline resumes, and tumors regrow when the
drug is discontinued. Therefore, therapy must be used chronically – perhaps lifelong. This highlights the urgent
unmet need for novel therapeutic strategies in LAM and TSC to eliminate (rather than suppress) LAM cells, for
novel biomarkers allowing personalization of therapy and to better understand genetic and clinical factors that
may help to predict the severity of LAM.
 This UO1 brings together a unique team of leaders in lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and tuberous
sclerosis complex (TSC) to address key unanswered questions with high clinical impact. First, identifying novel
biomarkers of LAM. Using in vitro and in vivo models of LAM and single cell RNA sequencing from human LAM
lungs, systematic analysis of the LAM cell “secretome” will elucidate the pathogenesis of LAM revealing novel
prognostic biomarkers. Second, investigating novel mTORC1-independent pathways leading to LAM cell
survival that could be therapeutically targeted to induce LAM cell death. Third, analysis of genetic modifiers of
LAM and of potential cryptic generalized somatic mosaicism for TSC2 gene mutations to elucidate LAM
pathogenesis and help identify patients at highest risk of progression."

Approximately half of all children in Pakistan are stunted, 15% are wasted, and 40% are underweight. Stunting
serves as a clinical marker for lifelong impairments in physical, immunological (including reduced vaccine
immunogenicity), neurocognitive, and socioeconomic potential. Environmental Enteric Dysfunction (EED) is
thought to be a key factor underlying malnutrition and subsequently stunting in children residing in low-and-
middle income countries (LMICs) such as Pakistan. EED is an acquired, subclinical, small intestinal condition
attributed to a continuous burden of immune stimulation by fecal-oral exposure to enteropathogens leading to a
persistent acute phase response and chronic inflammation. EED is an excellent example of the interplay between
infectious diseases and chronic malnutrition. Limited expertise and a paucity of formal training programs in
pediatric infectious diseases and gastroenterology and nutrition in Pakistan are impeding progress in addressing
this significant burden of disease. Through this proposal, we aim to build sustainable capacity in pediatric
infectious disease and gastroenterology and nutrition research, specifically related to EED and its complications
such as vaccine failure, undernutrition and subsequent growth failure in children residing in Pakistan. Training
through this grant will leverage ongoing collaborative research projects and didactic (doctoral and graduate)
programs currently offered at the Aga Khan University (AKU), Pakistan. We will achieve this via three training
pathways of varying durations. Track I will include a series of short-term courses and workshops to be conducted
on topics covering advanced wet bench laboratory skills, epidemiology, clinical nutrition and bioethics, all with
an infectious diseases focus. Track II will leverage graduate programs (Master’s) in Epidemiology and
Biostatistics and Clinical Research at AKU and in Data Science at the University of Virginia, USA for training
candidates. Track III will produce PhD scholars working in the fields of mucosal immunology, organoids,
developmental origins of health and diseases as well as clinical nutrition. Two prior successful cycles of this
grant have firmly laid the foundation of infectious diseases research at AKU. We plan to leverage this framework
in the next five years by producing a cadre of local, independent scientists studying the interplay of communicable
and non-communicable diseases, which remain a neglected area of research throughout the world, and
particularly in LMICs such as Pakistan. The overall impact of this training program will be to empower in-country
local researchers to significantly reduce the burden of EED with an overarching goal of pediatric infectious
disease and gastroenterology and nutrition research in Pakistan."

The photoreceptor cilium is the most elaborate of all primary cilia. Its plasma membrane is extensively
amplified to form a stack of disk membranes that contain a very high concentration of the visual receptor,
opsin. This stack of disks forms the photoreceptor outer segment, and its organization is central to visual
sensitivity and spatial resolution. The overall goal of the proposed research is to understand the cellular
mechanisms involved in the morphogenesis of the disk membranes.
 The research plan is built on the application of molecular tools, with the use of advanced microscopy,
including EM tomography and live-cell super-resolution microscopy, for high resolution, 3-D analysis. The
long-term goal of the proposed research is to provide a molecular understanding of photoreceptor disk
morphogenesis, including the mechanisms for delivering essential proteins to the site of membrane growth.
The Specific Aims will address unknown aspects of the ciliary localization of opsin, and the roles of disk
morphogenetic proteins in initiating lamellar growth, using both mouse rod photoreceptors in vivo and
cultures of cells bearing unspecialized cilia. Our findings will provide understanding of a key area of
photoreceptor cell biology. They will also be fundamental to our understanding of the pathogenesis of retinal
disease that ensues from perturbations of disk membrane morphogenesis."
10819539,"ABSTRACT
Neovascularization is a key feature of ischemic retinal diseases and the wet form of age-related
macular degeneration (AMD), all leading causes of severe vision loss. Vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors have transformed the treatment of these disorders. Currently,
three anti-VEGF drugs are widely used in the USA for ophthalmological indications, bevacizumab,
ranibizumab and aflibercept. Millions of patients have been treated with these drugs worldwide.
After five-year treatment with these drugs, about half of neovascular AMD patients had good
vision, i.e. visual acuity 20/40 or better, an outcome that would have been out of reach before
anti-VEGF agents were available. However, in real-life clinical settings, many patients do not
experience the same degree of benefit observed in clinical trials, in part because they receive
fewer anti-VEGF injection. So, there is an urgent need to discover and identify novel long-acting
VEGF inhibitors. We hypothesized that the ability to bind heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the
vitreous may be a strategy to promote intraocular retention, ultimately leading to a reduced burden
of intravitreal injections. We designed a series of VEGF receptor 1 variants and identified some
with strong heparin-binding characteristics and ability to bind to the vitreous. Preliminary data
indicate that some of our variants have longer duration and greater efficacy in animal models of
intraocular neovascularization than current standard of care. Our proposal represents the first
systematic attempt to exploit the functional diversity associated with heparin-affinity of a VEGF
receptor. We anticipate that it will result in the discovery and development of more effective and
durable VEGF inhibitors for intravitreal administration."
10818099,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parturition is a highly inflammatory event characterized by an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine
production, maternal leukocyte activation, and cellular infiltration into the uterus. However, untimely
inflammatory triggers may shift the maternal immune system towards the transition to labor early, such as in
cases of preterm birth (PTB). Currently, the mechanisms involved in the switch to a pro-inflammatory state and
parturition initiation is largely unknown. Evidence supports circulating damage-associated molecular patterns
(DAMPs) in the maternal blood, such as cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA), may trigger sterile inflammation and labor
through activation of maternal innate immune cells. cffDNA is continuously released from the placenta into the
maternal bloodstream with concentrations steadily increasing as pregnancy progresses, becoming
undetectable hours after parturition. Importantly, cffDNA is abnormally elevated in pathological pregnancies,
including PTB. The Enninga lab showed cffDNA, but not cell-free DNA (cfDNA), can activate maternal
monocytes through cGAS/STING to initiate hallmark processes of parturition; however, the mechanism of
cffDNA activation or why it is a potent immunostimulatory molecule remains incompletely understood. This F31
proposal seeks to evaluate whether inhibiting the cGAS/STING pathway can reduce CD14+ monocyte
activation and the pro-inflammatory cascade following cffDNA recognition (Aim 1) and identify the
immunostimulatory properties of cffDNA specific sequence motifs (Aim 2). Completion of these studies will
provide better understanding of the immunological processes driving labor at term. Additionally, it may provide
a novel small molecule target that could be tested clinically for dampening systemic maternal immune
activation, which would be especially important for PTB prevention. This award will provide Raini Sorenson
with individualized, mentored training from excellent faculty sponsors while working on dissertation research in
immunology. Furthermore, this training award will facilitate Raini’s development into a strong applicant for a
competitive post-doctoral position."

Alzheimer’s disease and the related disorder Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represent a major financial and
emotional burden to society, but to date no preventative strategies have been developed. While a critical barrier
to improving the quality of life for people suffering from or caring for those with FTD is a lack of mechanistic
understanding of the causes, there is substantial evidence that T cell dysfunction and the balance of T cell
subsets contributes to disease pathogenesis and may explain heterogenous patient outcomes. This suggests
that strategies to stabilize patient T regulatory cells and/or reduce levels of pro-inflammatory Th17 cells are likely
to benefit FTD patients. A key knowledge gap is how environmental signals such as those derived from the gut
microbiome interact with common FTD genotypes to affect T cell function and disease progression. A repeat
expansion in a non-protein-coding region of the gene C9ORF72 is the most common cause of FTD and the
related motor neuron disorder Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, responsible for approximately 10% of all diagnoses.
The C9ORF72 mutation acts through gain- and loss-of-function mechanisms to induce pathways that are
implicated in neural degeneration. The expansion is transcribed into a long repetitive RNA that sequesters RNA
binding proteins before being translated into aggregate-prone repetitive dipeptide proteins. The mutation also
leads to reduction of the endogenous C9ORF72 gene product that functions in endo-lysosomal pathways and
suppresses systemic and neural inflammation. In preliminary work, we have demonstrated that signals derived
from gut bacteria modify the penetrance and expressivity of neural inflammation in mice with reduction of
C9orf72. Additionally, we have established that C9orf72 functions in cells of both the myeloid and lymphoid
lineages to oppose autoimmunity and neural inflammation. The first AIM of this proposal will seek to elucidate
how C9orf72 functions within T cells to govern cell fate choice. The second AIM of this proposal will seek to
determine how a C9orf72 genotype influences pathogenic T cell responses to intestinal microbes and to
determine the extent to which pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin-17A participates in neural inflammation when
C9orf72 levels decline. In the third AIM of this proposal, we will evaluate whether the changes in T cell fate and
function we observe in our animal model also occur in humans with a C9ORF72 mutation that converts to FTD
but not in carriers of the mutation that are protected from neurological disease. The proposed studies have
potential to shed mechanistic insight into regulation of FTD/ALS disease course by T cells and to identify novel
prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic among pregnant women in Africa yet most women are asymptomatic
and unaware that their infants are at risk. Ninety percent of infants infected at birth will develop chronic HBV
infection with late manifestations of disease that include cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The World
Health Organization set a goal of HBV elimination by 2030 but current perinatal prophylaxis in Africa is
inadequate. This is a key barrier to reducing the population prevalence of disease. HBV vaccination from birth is
75-95% effective but low facility delivery rates and vaccine cold chain requirements hinder the success of this
one-pronged approach. Most HBV-exposed infants in Africa receive their first HBV vaccine at 2-3 months of age
which misses the perinatal prevention window. To address this pressing problem, this R01 application describes
gaps in scientific knowledge needed to advance perinatal HBV prevention considering the potential efficacy of
tenofovir therapy in reducing HBV viral load based on two published randomized trials in Asia and a potential
role for neonatal lamivudine prophylaxis. The central goal of this proposal is to identify a novel intervention that
is effective, safe and pragmatic in preventing perinatal transmission of HBV in Africa. This was developed in
response to NICHD priorities cited in PA-18-031. To meet this goal, an innovative, multicenter clinical trial titled
“REVERT-B: Reducing Vertical Transmission of Hepatitis B in Africa” was designed to be carried out by a
collaborative, productive and experienced research team at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and
in Cameroon. It will test the hypothesis that maternal and neonatal antiviral prophylaxis significantly reduces
HBV vertical transmission among high-risk women in Africa compared to optimized standard of care (4-dose
HBV vaccination beginning at birth). The hypothesis will be efficiently tested by pursuing two co-primary aims
with a factorial trial design. In Aim 1, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be conducted in four prenatal
clinics in Cameroon to test the efficacy of tenofovir in 480 pregnant women with HBV in reducing perinatal
transmission. Women will be randomized to daily tenofovir or placebo with a background of optimized standard
of care (infant vaccination). In Aim 2, neonates will be randomized to oral lamivudine or placebo for six weeks
to test the efficacy of neonatal prophylaxis. The primary endpoint for both aims is perinatal transmission defined
as the proportion of infants with active HBV infection (HBsAg+) at 6 months of age. Sub-aims will assess the
safety of prophylaxis and medication adherence. Data from this Phase III trial will be used to support follow up
studies to test the effectiveness and feasibility of combination maternal and/or neonatal antiviral prophylaxis in
a multi-country study of pregnant women in resource-limited settings. The expected outcome is to expand the
scientific toolkit for pregnant women with HBV (analogous to perinatal HIV prevention) and advance toward the
long-term goal of eliminating perinatal HBV transmission worldwide."
10809039,"Signal sequences target newly translated proteins to specific locations within and outside the cell, and
accordingly, play a key role in cell biology. Beyond their classical targeting functions, a number of non-
canonical functions of specific signal peptides have been reported in recent years, mostly in lower organisms,
but also in eucaryotic cells. However, much remains to be learned regarding the biology of signal sequences,
which have emerged as a new focus for drug development. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the
prototypic growth factor in angiogenesis, a key process during development, growth, adult homeostasis, and
response to injury, which is dysregulated in a broad spectrum of diseases, including ischemia-related
cardiovascular diseases, diabetic retinopathy and malignancy. The VEGF effects are primarily mediated by its
high affinity binding to VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 which triggers activation of several downstream signaling
pathways. This is a tightly controlled process with multiple layers of regulation to ensure a finely tuned signal.
Endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived neuropilin-like protein (DCBLD2) is an integral membrane protein
with an unusually long, two-subdomain organization signal sequence. We have identified DCBLD2 as a
regulator of VEGF signaling and developmental and ischemic angiogenesis. DCBLD2 associates with VEGFR-
2 and regulates VEGF signaling by modulating VEGFR-2-VE-cadherin-protein tyrosine phosphatase complex
formation. In search of DCBLD2 domain(s) involved in its interaction with VEGFR-2, unexpectedly we identified
a functional interaction between the DCBLD2 signal sequence and VEGFR-2. DCBLD2 signal sequence
expression, or addition of a synthetic peptide encompassing its hydrophobic, C-terminal moiety to cultured
cells promoted VEGF signal transduction. This led us to hypothesize that DCBLD2 signal sequence regulates
VEGF (and possibly other growth factors’) signal transduction and modulates angiogenesis, also raising the
possibility that other similarly structured signal sequences may play a regulatory role in growth factor signaling.
Here, we seek to expand the scope of these observations to define, and determine the mechanism of action of,
the post-targeting functions of DCBLD2 signal sequence on VEGF and related signaling pathways. To this end,
our specific aims are to investigate non-canonical functions of DCBLD2 signal sequence in VEGF signal
transduction and evaluate the effects of exogenous DCBLD2 signal sequence-related peptides on VEGF
signaling and angiogenesis. The proposed experiments establish a novel post-targeting function for signal
sequences in growth factor signal transduction and set the stage for future development of signal sequence-
based therapeutics, not only for angiogenesis, but potentially other disorders."

 Age-related hearing loss is a substantial national problem due to its high prevalence and significant quality-
of-life consequences. Although hearing aids (HAs) are the primary choice for the management of age-related
hearing loss, the adoption rate of HAs is quite low. A commonly reported barrier to HA uptake is that HAs ob-
tained in the traditional healthcare pathway, which requires multiple visits to a licensed professional (e.g., audi-
ologists) for hearing loss diagnosis and the month(s) long process of fitting and ﬁne-tuning HAs, are not afford-
able or accessible. We refer to this healthcare pathway as the AUD pathway. As an alternative pathway to im-
prove affordability and accessibility of hearing healthcare, the over-the-counter (OTC) pathway uses a direct-
to-consumer service-delivery model and enables users to self-determine hearing loss, self-fit the HA, and self-
manage device without professional support.
 Although the OTC pathway has become popular, little is known about how potential users determine the
right pathway for themselves (OTC vs. AUD) and how the OTC pathway impacts users’ long-term well-being.
To guide potential users in their selection of one pathway over the other and to improve well-being of people
with hearing loss, our project aims to characterize the entire OTC patient journey and compare that with the
AUD journey, from pathway selection, through patient outcomes and consequences of unsuccessful HA expe-
riences. Aim 1 seeks to understand the decision-making processes used by individuals to choose between the
OTC and AUD pathways (i.e., what factors they consider and what personal characteristics drive the decision).
Aim 2 seeks to determine the long-term (12 months) course of OTC outcomes (e.g., HA satisfaction) com-
pared with that of the AUD pathway and to establish the individual differences (e.g., finger dexterity) that ex-
plain the variance in long-term outcomes of each pathway. Aim 3 seeks to understand what people think and
do following unsuccessful OTC experiences and whether this is the same as for the AUD pathway (Aim 3).
 To achieve our aims, we will conduct a two-site (Iowa and Vanderbilt), mixed-methods, longitudinal study in
which participants choose their preferred healthcare pathways (OTC vs. AUD). Participants will purchase HAs
up-front, but will be able to return the devices for a refund within the manufacturers’ trial periods. After selecting
a pathway (Aim 1), participants will be contacted at 1-, 6- and 12-months post-fitting. At each contact, depend-
ing on the status of HA usage we will assess HA outcomes (Aim 2) or the engagement with hearing healthcare
behaviors (e.g., adopting new HAs, Aim 3). Our project will generate crucial data that will help us develop tools
(e.g., decision aids) that adults with hearing loss can use to make informed decisions regarding hearing
healthcare, and help ensure that the OTC pathway has a positive impact on their well-being."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The high mortality rate is not
only due to the lack of effective early detection but also due to poor tumor response to currently available
therapies. These underscore the urgent need to better understand the biological events and mechanism of lung
cancer suppression, as is the need for important new therapeutic approaches that specifically target these
processes to improve survival rates. Lung cancer is mainly divided into two types: small cell lung cancer (SCLC)
and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the latter of which accounts for 80-85% of all cases. A new subset of
lung cancer in both SCLC and NSCLC was recently identified in which Rapamycin-insensitive companion of
mTOR (Rictor) gene is amplified. Rictor is an essential component of the mammalian target of rapamycin
complex 2 (mTORC2) and is required for mTORC2 complex activity and integrity. Activation of mTORC2 results
in promotion of cancer cell proliferation and survival. This application builds on exciting preliminary data that
Programmed cell death 4 (Pdcd4) bound with Rictor through a Rictor binding domain (RBD) to inhibit mTORC2
activity, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) level, cell proliferation, and colony
formation. In addition, a peptide containing the RBD specifically inhibits mTORC2 but not mTORC1. Our data
further demonstrated that the RBD peptide suppressed NSCLC proliferation in cultured cells and nude mice. The
central hypothesis is that Pdcd4-Rictor binding specifically inhibits mTORC2 to preferentially suppress
proliferation in Rictor-elevated NSCLC via induction of proteasomal degradation of PFKFB3. To test this
hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed: i) Delineate the mechanism of how Pdcd4-Rictor binding interferes
with mTORC2 activity to suppress tumor growth in NSCLC; ii) Dissect how Pdcd4-Rictor-mTORC2 axis impacts
PFKFB3 stability and metabolic pathways; iii) Demonstrate that mTORC2-specific inhibition by RBD peptide
preferentially suppresses the growth of Rictor-elevated NSCLC to improve survival rate. The accomplishment of
the proposed study will not only uncover novel regulatory mechanisms of mTORC2 activity and PFKFB3
expression by Pdcd4 but also reveal the importance of mTORC2-specific inhibition by RBD peptide on NSCLC
tumorigenesis. The expected findings will guide us to develop new strategies that are particularly relevant to
precision medicine approaches for NSCLC patients with elevated Rictor."
10797816,"SUMMARY
Cancer is caused by dynamics of the genome, which ultimately translate into aberrations of the proteome
constituting the major functional and structural components of a cell. The proteome comprises a high level of
complexity driven by aspects such as post-translational protein modifications, accurately regulated protein
degradation, and functional regulation through protein-protein interaction networks. It is also considered the
closest molecular link to a biological system’s phenotype. Mass spectrometry is among the most important tools
to characterize proteomes, and its versatility is well suited to match the proteome’s complexity. It is, therefore,
surprising that the information on understanding and diagnosing cancer provided by the cancer proteome is
almost entirely untapped in clinical studies. Among the reasons for this is a lack of sample throughput of mass
spectrometry-based proteomics when compared to genomics technologies. This translates into higher analysis
costs and reduced access to proteomics. Our overarching aim for this proposal is to develop a novel mass
spectrometry-based proteomics data acquisition method that increases sample throughput of deep proteome
mapping (>2000 proteins from blood plasma, >8000 proteins from tissue samples) in comparison to current
methods by a factor of up to tenfold (10 min per sample). The method is based on multiplexed isobaric
proteomics, a barcoding technology that currently allows the simultaneous analyses of up to 18 samples. The
novel aspect is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to drive the data acquisition process. The proteomics
community has started to incorporate AI into their workflow for data analysis, but it has not yet been used for
improving data acquisition. Our AI system directs the mass spectrometer in real-time to optimize the analysis of
globally targeting all proteins assumed to be in a sample at a fast rate. Proteome samples are digested into
peptides, and a combination of neural networks trained on millions of mass spectrometry spectra is used to
predict in real-time peptide analyte behavior to optimize the analytical speed at high analytical depth. A
preliminary version of the method allows mapping 1,300 plasma proteins in 10 min per sample. We propose in
Aim 1 further improvement of the method through additional neural networks enabling more sensitive real-time
peptide identification and the simultaneous identification of multiple peptides. Our goal is to generate a method
that will routinely quantify 2000 proteins from human plasma in 10 minutes. The method will be incorporated
into a platform that also includes low-cost automated sample preparation to achieve an overall analysis cost of
<$100 per sample. We propose to evaluate the method in Aim 2 by mapping the proteome of 500 clinical plasma
proteome samples from lung cancer patients with different pathological cancer stages. Our preliminary data
analysis shows a high predictive power of mass spectrometry-based proteomics for detecting early-stage lung
cancer, and we will use the evaluation to validate detection power across early to late stages. We believe that
our novel AI-driven mass spectrometry-based proteome mapping has a high potential to overcome the current
hurdles of using deep coverage proteomics in clinical settings."

Pediatric cardiac arrest is a serious life-threatening problem affecting more than 15,000 hospitalized children each
year in the US alone. Fewer than 50% of these children survive to hospital discharge, and neurological morbidity
is common among those who survive. Importantly, pediatric cardiac arrest survival outcomes plateaued more
than a decade ago, and there is hence a critical need for evidence-based and innovative therapeutic approaches.
In particular, a signiﬁcant number of patients fail to achieve return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) even af-
ter 30 minutes of conventional CPR and may be candidates for what is termed Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (ECPR). ECPR is a treatment that involves the use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxy-
genation (VA-ECMO) and has been used successfully for resuscitation from shock or cardiac arrest in adult and
pediatric patients. It is often utilized as an alternative resuscitation intervention for in-hospital Cardiac Arrest
(IHCA) patients. Currently it is not clear if and which subpopulation of cardiac arrest victims may beneﬁt from
this intervention. Hence this proposal aims to develop advanced machine learning and signal processing algo-
rithms using a sizeable, high-quality dataset which will identify speciﬁc underlying characteristics of the patient
who would beneﬁt from ECPR. In particular, in Aim 1, we will develop a model using pre-arrest demographic,
physiologic, and biochemical data to predict failure to achieve ROSC within 30 minutes of CPR. We will also de-
velop a model using pre-arrest and intra-arrest physiologic data, including continuous invasive and non-invasive
waveform data over the ﬁrst <5, <10, <15, <20, <30 minutes of CPR to predict failure to achieve ROSC. In Aim
2, we will identify pre- and intra-arrest characteristics from discontinuous data and continuous invasive and
non-invasive waveform data of ECPR and develop a model to predict survivability to hospital discharge. Such a
model would enable initiation of ECPR in critically ill patients who are unlikely to survive otherwise and hence
lead to overall improvement of survival for in-hospital CPR patients."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis is a major cause of mortality, yet there is a distinct lack of therapies targeting
metastasis. Among the major modifiable external factors known to affect CRC risk are diet and obesity; however,
unlike cancer initiation, how pro-obesity high fat diets (HFD) can impact cancer metastasis remains an essential
question. Our understanding of the biology of metastatic cells is significantly impeded by a lack of in-vivo CRC
models that recapitulate metastatic disease. This proposal leverages our orthotopic transplantation model of
CRC, where genetically-engineered CRC organoids harboring common mutations found in human CRC are
transplanted via colonoscopy into recipient host colons, forming tumors that later metastasize to the liver. Using
this system, we have begun to study how CRC with different driver mutations such as APC, KRAS and p53,
metastasize and adapt to the liver microenvironment in diet induced obesity. We have observed that diet induced
obesity increases CRC metastasis to the liver. Our initial single cell RNA-Sequencing analyses of the primary
colon and liver metastatic tumors have identified tumor intrinsic and extrinsic changes in response to an
obesogenic HFD. Tumor intrinsic responses to HFD include increased YAP1 signaling and tumor-specific “revival
stem cell” or revSC like populations. In our AIM1 of mentored K99 phase, using CRISPR mediated knock out
models and untargeted metabolite profiling, we will identify the role of Hippo/YAP1 signaling in tumor metastasis
and metabolic adaptations in pro-obesity HFD. In our AIM2 (K99 phase), leveraging reporter mouse models and
single cell RNA-Sequencing, we will identify the contribution of revSCs in metastatic seeding, and the role of
YAP1 regenerative signaling in mediating revSC like phenotypes in obesity. In our AIM3 of independent R00
phase, we will identify tumor extrinsic niche factors that contribute to increased metastasis in HFD. In our
preliminary single cell profiling of the tumor niche in HFD, we observe evolution of specific Spp1 and Cxcl1
expressing cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the colon and liver metastatic niche. AIM3 will specifically
characterize the origin, role and interactions of these CAF populations. The K99 training will mainly focus on
cancer stem cell niche and modeling, single cell analyses, and tumor metabolism. This will be accomplished by
training with the primary mentor, Dr Omer Yilmaz, with expertise in intestinal stem cells and their niche, colorectal

Providers across multiple specialties face challenges in determining the clinical significance of a
positive antinuclear antibody (ANA). While a positive ANA is highly sensitive for autoimmune
disease, it is non-specific with up to 20% of the general population having a positive ANA
without having autoimmune disease. Risk models to aide clinicians in stratifying positive ANA
patients do not currently exist. By identifying high-risk patients, providers could properly triage
patients for prompt treatment to reduce autoimmune disease-related morbidity and mortality.
Our long-term goal is to build risk models in the electronic health record (EHR) for autoimmune
diseases that improve outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify positive
ANA patients who are at high risk for developing autoimmune disease to facilitate appropriate
triage to rheumatology for earlier diagnosis and treatment. Our institution with expertise in
biostatistics, biomedical informatics, and implementation science has demonstrated success in
building and testing robust EHR risk models. Building upon this well-established infrastructure,
we hypothesize that we can use available EHR data to identify positive ANA patients that are
high risk for autoimmune disease. We hypothesize that using tailored risk assessments in real-
time in the EHR can reduce time to autoimmune disease diagnosis and treatment. We will test
these hypotheses with the following specific aims: (1) Refine and validate features available in
the EHR to distinguish positive ANA patients who develop autoimmune disease from positive
ANA patients who do not develop autoimmune disease and (2) Conduct an adaptive,
randomized, pragmatic evaluation of an autoimmune disease risk model in the EHR to risk-
stratify patients with a positive ANA. For Aim 1, we will validate a risk model for autoimmune
disease in positive ANA patients using EHR data with logistic regression and machine learning
methods. For Aim 2, we will deploy a risk model for autoimmune disease in real-time in the
EHR. We will randomize positive ANA patients to either have a risk score from the model
displayed and acted upon vs. not having a risk score displayed or usual care. We will assess if
having this EHR system change with a risk score calculated and shared with the ordering
provider compared to usual care affects time to autoimmune disease diagnosis and treatment.
Our proposal is innovative in that it not only builds a predictive risk model for autoimmune
disease but also deploys and assesses if the model impacts patient outcomes. For expected
outcomes, we anticipate deploying an EHR risk model that identifies positive ANA patients at
high risk for developing autoimmune disease and decreases time to diagnosis and treatment."
10811643,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most highly prevalent mental health disorder among U.S.
military Veterans. PTSD is a chronic disorder that is associated with significant morbidity, mortality,
disability, and costly health care expenditures. The clinical impairment associated with PTSD among Veterans
is severe and associated with comorbid depression, suicidality, substance abuse, physical health
problems, interpersonal violence, and neuropsychiatric impairment. Despite these pervasive health
consequences, the current treatment services offered to Veterans do not adequately address PTSD.
Several promising psychosocial interventions, including Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy, have been
developed for the treatment of PTSD. Although PE is one of the most widely used evidence-based
treatments for PTSD, there is substantial room for improvement in outcomes and retention rates. For example,
approximately one-third of patients dropout of PE treatment prematurely, and the highest dropout rates occur
among Veterans. Consistent with the VA Office of Research and Development initiative to develop effective
treatments for PTSD, identifying pharmacotherapies to enhance PTSD treatment retention and outcomes is
critical. Accumulating data from our group and others suggests that oxytocin is a promising candidate to
achieve this goal. Oxytocin is known to promote prosocial behaviors associated with successful
psychosocial treatment outcomes (e.g., trust, safety, social cognition) and has demonstrated positive effects
on extinction learning in animal and human stress models. Furthermore, recent neuroimaging studies show
that oxytocin has the ability to ameliorate dysregulation of the corticolimbic brain circuitry, which is a central
component of the pathophysiology and maintenance of PTSD. In the only study to date examining the
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of augmenting PE with oxytocin, our group found that
participants randomized to the oxytocin condition demonstrated lower PTSD and depression symptoms
during PE, and had higher working alliance scores compared to participants randomized to the placebo
condition. Therefore, the primary objective of the proposed two-site Phase II study is to examine the ability of
oxytocin (vs. placebo) combined with PE therapy to (1) reduce PTSD symptom severity, (2) improve
rate of PTSD symptom improvement, and (3) improve PE adherence and retention rates. To
accomplish these objectives, we will employ a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and use
standardized, repeated dependent measures of change at five time points (baseline, mid-treatment, end of
treatment, and 3 and 6 month follow-up). The proposed study directly addresses the mission of the Veterans
Health Administration Blueprint for Excellence in that it seeks to advance personalized and proactive mental
health care opportunities for Veterans. Findings from this study will provide critical new information regarding
the efficacy of oxytocin to augment psychosocial treatment for PTSD, as well as information regarding the
neurobiological mechanisms underlying PTSD and positive treatment response."
10811766,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While the autoimmune destruction of pancreatic ß-cells causing type 1 diabetes (T1D) is ultimately a T-cell
mediated process, it is clear in the NOD mouse model and also likely humans, that B-lymphocytes play an
additional key pathogenic role. B-lymphocytes likely contribute to T1D by being the subset of APC most
efficiently supporting pathogenic T-cell activation. This is due to the presence of B-lymphocytes expressing
immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules that can efficiently capture and internalize ß-cell autoantigens. Thus, defects in
mechanisms normally blocking the development or activity of autoreactive B- as well as T-lymphocytes
contribute to T1D. Due to their role in supporting pathogenic T-cell responses there has been considerable
interest in developing possible B-lymphocyte directed T1D interventions. Hence, the central hypothesis of this
proposal is that gaining an increased understanding of the developmental and functional activity basis of T1D
relevant B-lymphocytes in NOD mice could be of significance in identifying a means by which they could be
effectively targeted. In this regards, current data indicate BAFF blockade may be a more effective B-
lymphocyte directed T1D intervention than anti-CD20 treatment. Preliminary data now indicate a hypomorphic
Ephb2 allelic variant may represent a T1D susceptibility (Idd) gene in NOD mice acting at the level of B-
lymphocytes. Transgenically elevating Ephb2 expression inhibits T1D development through a B-lymphocyte
dependent process. Aim 1 will address the currently unknown question if NOD B-lymphocytes with elevated
Ephb2 expression have lost an ability to functionally activate diabetogenic T-cells, or alternatively have gained
a capacity to functionally suppress such pathogenic effectors. We also previously found that a genetic and
pharmaceutical approach inhibiting the ability of B-lymphocytes to undergo the processes of Ig somatic
hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR) inhibits T1D development in NOD mice. Such
T1D protection resulted from B-lymphocytes unable to undergo SHM and CSR converting to a regulatory
phenotype (Breg) that inhibit pathogenic T-cells through increased activity of the immunosuppressive
CD39/CD73 ecto-enzyme axis. More recent studies unexpectedly indicate ablation of the CD39 gene inhibits
T1D development in NOD mice, and this is associated with a respective proportional increase and decrease in
total B- and T-lymphocytes. Thus, Aim 2 is to determine if ablation of CD39 inhibits T1D development in NOD
mice by expanding B-lymphocytes with a capacity to suppress pathogenic T-cell responses. We have also
found T1D onset is accelerated in NOD mice with B-lymphocytes transgenically expressing an Ig specificity
recognizing the peripherin molecule present in both pancreatic islets and neurons (NOD-PerIg mice), but this
strain can also develop a potential multiple sclerosis (MS) relevant neurtitis syndrome. Aim 3 will determine
the potential overlap in B-lymphocyte driven T-cell populations mediating T1D and neuritis development in
NOD-PerIg mice, and assess if either of these pathologies can be attenuated by BAFF blockade."

Walking enables independence and exploration in daily life. For people with cerebral palsy (CP), a brain injury
near the time of birth alters their ability to move and participate in daily activities. Treatments seek to improve
walking function, but the processes by which people with CP adapt and learn new movement patterns are
poorly understood. Our prior research demonstrated that patient-specific measures of motor control (i.e., how
an individual recruits and coordinates their muscles) are important indicators of walking function and
treatment outcomes. Children with more impaired motor control compared to nondisabled peers have worse
function and worse outcomes after treatments like orthopedic surgery or selective dorsal rhizotomy. The
premise of our proposed research is that patient-specific measures of adaptation are equally important to
understand and inform care, but we lack methods to quantify adaptation or effectively induce motor learning.
Whether adaptation is altered in CP and whether targeted training can amplify adaptation to improve walking
function remains unknown. Multimodal feedback training is a promising approach to support adaptation and
motor learning, but few studies have evaluated adaptation with real-time feedback training during walking or
its impacts on walking function. The proposed research seeks to fill these gaps by completing the systematic
experimental analyses necessary to quantify walking adaption rates (Aim-1) and determine whether repeated
exposure to multimodal feedback training can alter adaptation rates (Aim-2) to induce motor learning and
improve walking function (Aim-3). Specifically, we examine adaptation rates in response to multimodal
feedback training that targets plantarflexor function, a key muscle group for walking that is nearly universally
impaired in CP. We provide multimodal feedback using (1) sensorimotor feedback from adaptive ankle
resistance delivered via a light-weight, wearable robot and (2) audiovisual feedback of plantar flexor activity
from EMG recordings. By evaluating responses of children with CP to this feedback training – both individually
and combined – this research will establish the scientific basis to quantify and understand adaptation and
motor learning in CP."

Age modifies heart structure and function, even in the absence of overt cardiovascular
disease. With age-related cardiac remodeling, the heart undergoes extensive cellular
and molecular changes that result in a stiffer less compliant heart that experiences an
overall decline in function. Yet, the human heart is capable of functioning for decades
despite minimal cell turnover or regeneration, suggesting that some mechanisms of
age-related cardiac remodeling may be compensatory and beneficial, helping sustain
heart function over our life span. Recent evidence indicates the upregulation of
cytoskeletal proteins may represent a cardioprotective mechanism in the aging heart. In
this exploratory R21 proposal, we hypothesize that enhancing the cytoskeletal
connection between N-cadherin and the cortical actin network represents an essential
compensatory mechanism to maintain force transmission in the aging mammalian heart.
To test this hypothesis, the regulation of vinculin, a force-sensitive cytoskeletal protein,
will be investigated during cardiac aging in mice. The following interrelated aims are
proposed: (1) To test the hypothesis that Abl kinase is required to maintain mechano-
electrical integrity in the aging heart. (2) To test the hypothesis that inhibition of tyrosine
phosphorylation of vinculin will perturb N-cadherin-cytoskeletal connection leading to
accelerated cardiac aging. The proposed studies will allow mechanistic insight into how
the major predisposing factor in heart disease, age, affects the remodeling of N-
cadherin junctions and mechanical coupling in the aging heart."

Project Summary: Methadone is the oldest approved medication for treating opioid use disorder (OUD) and,
for many patients, it is the optimal treatment for managing symptoms and reducing overdose risk. Since its
approval in 1972, methadone has been dispensed nearly exclusively through highly regulated opioid treatment
programs (OTPs), operating in fixed locations. In June 2021, however, the US Drug Enforcement
Administration released a rule expanding methadone access by allowing OTPs to create mobile treatment
units (motor vehicles equipped with secure dispensing) under their existing registration. To encourage mobile
methadone implementation, the New York Office of Addiction Services and Supports launched a statewide
pilot grant program to support the creation of mobile methadone and selected an initial thirteen grantees.
Mobile methadone has the potential to expand methadone access and other services (e.g., counseling) to
people who otherwise would need to travel long distances or experience challenges reaching traditional
programs. This project will examine implementation of the New York pilot program with the goal of informing
the feasibility and scope of implementing similar programs in other states during an ongoing national overdose
crisis. This is consistent with the NIDA goals of increasing the public health impact of research and developing
novel approaches to treatment. Aim 1 proposes to study barriers and facilitators to launching mobile programs
among pilot OTPs and their community partners. Semi-structured interviews (N=40) will be conducted with
staff members from pilot OTPs partner organizations that serve people with OUD in the local pilot site
communities, such as social service agencies and harm reduction organizations. Interviews will explore
opportunities and constraints that shape the early implementation of units in pilot site communities. Aim 2
explores the need and preferences for receiving mobile services among current and potential patients. A
survey will be fielded with people with OUD (N=160): 80 current mobile methadone patients and 80 people with
OUD not currently using any mobile services. Questions will examine preferences for care, individual service
needs, and prior experiences receiving care. Aim 3 develops a location simulation tool to inform the selection
of treatment stops for mobile units. Using claims data from the state the locations of current and potential
mobile methadone clients (people with diagnosed OUD) will be mapped in relation to the brick-and-mortar
OTPs. Using geospatial clustering methods, we will identify areas in the state with unmet need for services and
develop a simulation approach for selecting areas within driving distance of the OTP to be served by mobile
units, and predict the likely number of patients who would receive care at the units. The project will include
regular briefings with stakeholders in New York, including OASAS staff and pilot grantees. Research will inform
a future R01 to evaluate the longer-term impact of the New York program on access and overdose."
10810013,"Our focus is on translation of a novel microscopy approach, femtosecond pump-probe microscopy, which
our preliminary data shows can determine which (nominally) early-stage primary melanomas are instead
metastatic cancer. This is important because the current clinical “gold standard” of staging (histopathology and
sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)) can assign early (non-metastatic) stages to tumors which are in reality
metastatic cancers, which delays treatment and costs lives. In fact, more people die from melanoma after initial
Stage I tumor diagnosis than after diagnosis of any higher grade. Today adjuvant therapies have made great
strides (on late-stage tumors) but all FDA-approved therapies are restricted to metastatic (stage III or IV)
melanomas because significant treatment-related adverse events are common. We believe adjuvant therapies
could be more effective, and less toxic, if applied to supposedly early stage tumors which have already generated
undetected metastases. Such “early adjuvant therapy” could have great benefits for disease control, reduced
toxicity, and reduced health costs, but this requires a good marker for deciding which early-stage patients should
go into such therapy, and existing markers have limited value. Our preliminary results show that we can identify
such patients with pump-probe microscopy. The ultimate goal is routine identification of incorrectly classified
early-stage lesions, at least from stages IIB/C and preferably from earlier stages as well, so the patient can be
treated to interrupt disease progression.
Specific Aim 1 focuses on optimizing multi-parameter pump-probe imaging to concentrate the clinically
relevant contrast. The apparatus redesign features modulation schemes that keep the applied power constant
while retaining complete control over pulse polarization and delays, plus detection schemes with angular
resolution. Demonstrations start with melanin in model systems and melanoma cells and move on to biopsies,
characterizing directional and polarization components of the pump-probe decay to maximize signal correlation
with chemical or cellular melanin degradation. Specific Aim 2 focuses on maximizing diagnostic utility using
patient biopsies from the Duke Biorepository to retrospectively diagnose metastatic melanoma and test the
performance of the improved clinically relevant contrast. This work is closely connected to pathology, as we view
the technology as complementing existing diagnostic protocols. Based on our very encouraging preliminary
results, machine learning algorithms will pay a large role in our assessment of diagnostic utility. We expect to
demonstrate that for at least Stage IIB/IIC tumors (7000 cases a year) pump-probe imaging can reliably segment
this population and identify the patients who almost certainly need treatment beyond excision."

Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, disorganized
thought, impaired emotional and motivational processes, and cognitive dysfunction. Antipsychotic medications
help diminish positive symptoms but do not alleviate negative symptoms or cognitive impairments.
Our understanding of the potential role of lactate in energy metabolism during brain activation has changed
radically over the past three decades, shifting from waste product to supplemental fuel and signaling molecule.
The lactate produced within astrocytes can also be shuttled through extracellular space into neurons as a
substrate for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Emerging evidence suggests lactate generated by glycolysis
in glial cells constitutively supports synaptic transmission and plays a key role in memory consolidation and
high attentional load in cognitive tasks. It has been hypothesized that defects in bioenergetic interplay of
astrocytes and neurons likely contribute to negative symptoms and impaired cognition in SZ.
Unlike bipolar disorder (BD), few brain lactate studies are reported in SZ. This is beginning to change with a
recent series of studies performed on 7 T. With the strong overlapping macromolecule signal and its low
concentration, lactate measurement is subject to low reliability with existing techniques either on 3 T or 7 T.
Lactate quantification is challenging and many scans in studies need to be excluded even with relatively loose
quantification criteria (e.g. Cramer Rao Lower Bound or CRLB < 30%). We recently developed an MRS
sequence which we term HOPE (Half-intensity with macrOmolecule-suPprEssion). HOPE achieves substantial
improvement of lactate measurements with CRLB ~ 13% with a 10 min scan time, using a modified SPECIAL
sequence with macromolecule suppression. Other metabolites such as glutamate (Glu) and glutathione (GSH)
can also be measured with minimal macromolecule contamination using this approach.
We propose to measure lactate in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), centrum semiovale (CSO) and
ventricles. With their different compositions of GM (enriched for neuronal cell bodies), WM (with more glial cells
and myelin) and CSF (extracellular space), we aim to provide novel insights concerning bioenergetics in the
schizophrenia (SZ) brain. These comprehensive lactate measurements will be performed in both first episode
(FE) and chronic SZ for the first time, together with a series of functional and behavioral assessments. We will
correlate lactate levels from DLPFC, white matter tracts and CSF with clinical assessments, especially
negative subscale of PANSS (negative symptoms), Multnomah Community Ability Scale (community function)
and Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (cognition). This design will also provide preliminary
evidence on the dynamic progression of lactate abnormalities in SZ which can be interpreted in the context of
other biological processes which unfold from early to later phases of illness."
10805437,"Component A: Virginia Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) seeks
to implement the CDC PRAMS protocol in Virginia for 2021-2025. PRAMS utilizes a complex
sampling methodology to collect data from Virginia women who have recently delivered a live
birth infant. Information on health behaviors and experiences before, during and shortly after
pregnancy is collected. Virginia uses PRAMS data to identify emerging health issues, establish
health objectives, track progress on state and national objectives, and develop and evaluate
public health policies and programs related to maternal and child health. Virginia PRAMS
provides statewide and some health district level data. PRAMS is the sole data source for the
majority of these indicators and provides critical data for many of Virginia’s ongoing initiatives
and grants, including the Title V Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant and the
Virginia Neonatal Perinatal Collaborative (VNPC). PRAMS also provides population-level data
to a host of Virginia programs, including those related to breastfeeding, home visiting, dental
health, tobacco, and injury and violence prevention. PRAMS provides data on Healthy People
2030 goals related to access to health services, injury and violence prevention, immunization,
maternal and child health, family planning, early and middle childhood, mental health and
mental disorders, tobacco use, and oral health.
 There are multiple avenues through which PRAMS has the ability to impact population
health. At its most basic level, PRAMS is used in Virginia to document trends in adverse birth
outcomes, the first step to understanding population health. Through Virginia’s increased
sampling of a high-risk population, PRAMS can further identify sub-populations at high risk and
correlates of risk and develop strategies and programs in response.
 Success in this present application will mark Virginia’s fifteenth year of PRAMS funding
and operations. As such, major project components (e.g., staffing, sampling and data analysis,
data collection procedures and protocols, IRB approval, steering committee, etc.) are fully
developed and presently implemented. Major project components are revised by the state
PRAMS team in coordination with the Steering Committee and CDC PRAMS as operational
needs dictate."
10813133,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 DNA-Protein crosslinks (DPCs) are irreversible covalent crosslinks of proteins to DNA that stall replication
forks during DNA replication. Unrepaired stalled forks lead to DNA breaks and fork collapse, leading to genome
instability, cell death or senescence. SPRTN is a DNA-dependent replication-coupled metalloprotease that
catalyzes proteolysis of DPCs during DPC repair. SPRTN also regulates replication fork progression and
translesion DNA synthesis. Ruijs-Aalfs (RJALS) syndrome patients with bi-allelic mutations in SPRTN protease
domain are prone to genome instability, segmental progeria and early-onset hepatocellular carcinoma.
Regulation of SPRTN protease function is critical for accurate DNA replication fork progression and DPC repair.
This proposed study is designed to characterize novel regulators of SPRTN and investigate the molecular
mechanism underlying SPRTN-mediated replication-coupled DPC repair.
 Investigating the regulation of SPRTN and SPRTN-mediated DPC repair pathway will further our
understanding of the DPC repair pathway, delineate the mechanism of RJALS syndrome, and help develop novel
strategies for sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy by targeting SPRTN-mediated DPC repair pathway."
10812858,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epilepsy is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders. Patients with epilepsy experience abnormal brain
activity causing seizures or periods of unusual behavior, sensations, and often loss of awareness or
consciousness. Deep brain stimulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT-DBS) is an approved
therapy that effectively reduces seizures in many patients with drug resistant epilepsy, but very rarely leads to
all-important complete freedom from disabling seizures. This gap in treatment effectiveness may stem from
limited understanding of the mechanism underlying ANT-DBS, as it remains unknown not only which areas of a
complex neuronal network ANT-DBS must modulate, but also how those structures are modulated, to achieve
its therapeutic effect. We hypothesize that ANT-DBS results in direct, local inhibition of ANT neurons, and its
downstream pathway. We propose a set of experiments to identify and modulate the neuronal network
components that mediate ANT-DBS effectiveness, using the intrahippocampal kainic acid mouse model of
temporal lobe epilepsy. We will first determine whether ANT neurons contribute to the seizure suppressive effect
of ANT-DBS by ablating or modulating subpopulations of intrinsic neurons (Aim1). We then will examine whether
the ANT-retrosplenial cortex (RSCx) pathway is a necessary conduit for ANT- DBS to be effective, by
manipulating RSCx neurons that receive direct input from the ANT (Aim 2). Finally, we will test the hypothesis
that ANT-DBS might suppress seizure by inhibiting afferent axons from areas projecting to the ANT, such as the
mammillary bodies (Aim 3). Identifying the circuit mechanism of ANT-DBS would improve patient outcomes by
leading to more precise guidelines for improved device targeting, prediction of patients that respond to ANT-
DBS, and pave the way for novel therapies that can target this seizure-resistant network or use similar
mechanisms."
10812860,"Fibrosis is a common histological manifestation of chronic kidney disease (CKD), characterized by epithelial
atrophy, accumulation of myofibroblasts, collagen, and immune cells. The degree of fibrosis predicts kidney
function decline regardless of disease etiology. While the kidney can fully regenerate and repair following acute
kidney injury (AKI), it is believed that a maladaptive injury response plays a key role in fibrosis development.
Over the past 15 years, as part of this grant, our lab has made remarkable progress in systematically dissecting
adaptive and maladaptive regeneration, and demonstrated the role of Notch signaling in the injury and repair
process. During the first decade of this grant, we demonstrated that transient Notch activation in progenitor cells
is essential for reparative regeneration. In contrast, during fibrosis, Notch expression remains elevated in tubule
cells, hindering terminal differentiation through metabolic reprogramming.
Single cell studies have discovered an emergence of new PT cell subpopulation (named differently by various
groups), including failed repair, maladaptive, repairing, injured (iPT), and profibrotic PT (pPT) in diseased
kidneys. Experiments indicate that iPT/pPT cells secrete various chemokines, such as IL-34, which play a role
in attracting macrophages, and their role in kidney fibrosis and disease has been extensively characterized. Our
team has shown that iPT/pPT cells secrete CXCL1, attracting basophils and orchestrating fibrosis by inviting
Th17 cells. Computational analysis highlighted strong enrichment for NFKB in iPT/pPT cells. Since NFKB is
known regulator not only proinflammatory cytokines such as IL34, CXCL1, CCL2, but also key survival genes,
activation of NFKB could create a circuit that may explain the emergence of iPT/pPT and the development of
fibrosis.
Aim 1: We will systematically characterize iPT/pPT cells in mouse and rat kidney disease models, as well as in
patient samples. Specifically, we aim to identify iPT/pPT subtypes, conserved, species- and disease-specific
markers, and driver transcriptional programs. We will define the spatial iPT/pPT niche and investigate their cell-
cell interactions.
Aim 2: To understand essential molecular changes underlying the emergence of iPT/pPT, first, we will
characterize their emergence using an engineered CRISPR-Cas9 mouse line with simultaneous readout of
lineage histories and gene expression profiles at single-cell resolution. We will validate the role of mitochondrial
damage and cytokine treatment by studying isolated tubule cells.
Aim 3: We will delineate the contribution of NFKB activation to iPT/pPT differentiation, chemokine secretion,
survival, and fibrosis development by using mice with genetic deletion of pathway components."

 The central nervous system (CNS) is protected by two barrier systems, the blood brain-barrier (BBB) and the
blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (B-CSFB). These barrier systems have unique cellular properties that regulate
the molecules and cells that can enter or exit the CNS and the CSF. CNS barriers are essential for development
and health but breakdown in a variety of diseases, causing or exacerbating CNS pathology. A detailed under-
standing of CNS barriers is also essential for efficient drug delivery to the brain and spinal cord. The development
and function of the B-CSFB at the level of the meninges, a trilayered structure that surrounds the CNS, is poorly
understood. This is despite evidence implicating meninges-located barriers in perinatal and adult diseases as
an early site of immune cell activation and entry in neuroinflammation. One of two barrier structures in the me-
ninges is the arachnoid barrier layer, which segregates the outer meningeal dura and its non-barrier vasculature,
from the CSF and cell types in the subarachnoid space. Unlike the BBB and other parts of the B-CSFB, nothing
is known about mechanisms of arachnoid barrier cell specification, timing of layer maturation or acquisition of
functional properties. Further, only a few studies have looked at arachnoid barrier dysfunction in CNS diseases
and so far, no studies have tested if an immature arachnoid barrier has enhanced vulnerability to breakdown.
 We have combined our knowledge of CNS vascular and BBB development with our unique expertise in the
meninges to develop new tools to study the arachnoid barrier. Experiments proposed here build upon our initial
discoveries to identify mechanisms that underlie arachnoid barrier layer development, investigate arachnoid bar-
rier maturation and function, and measure its response in insult. To do this we will: 1) utilize in vivo and culture
models to uncover the molecular mechanisms of arachnoid barrier cell specification, 2) use our new model where
we perturb arachnoid barrier formation prenatally to determine its role in establishing separate meninges immune
cell and vascular compartments and in protecting the fetal brain in an animal model of maternal infection 3)
identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms of arachnoid barrier breakdown in bacterial meningitis. Comple-
tion of this work will substantially advance the field of CNS barrier systems. It will provide the first model of
arachnoid barrier development including the cellular and molecular mechanisms and the timing of emergence of
barrier properties. It will provide important information about the function of the arachnoid barrier. Experiments
proposed here focus on the prenatal brain however findings will set the stage for future studies in postnatal and
adult function. Third, it will provide the most detailed analysis to date of arachnoid barrier response to CNS insult,
paving the way for future studies in other CNS diseases. In the long term, this new knowledge has the potential
to be used to design new ways to limit crossing of molecules and cells at the arachnoid barrier to treat disease
or increase crossing of drug therapeutics to access the CNS."

The cumulative evidence indicates neuro-inflammation play crucial roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and anti-
inflammatory agents (i.e., microglia-targeted therapies) show potential treatments for AD. The treatment
window for microglia-targeted therapies may at least be open later in AD due to the nature of microglial biology.
If amyloid-β is the trigger for AD, and tau is the executioner, then microglia are accelerators of disease
progression. Microglia-targeted approaches have a better chance of success in mild to moderate disease
compared to anti-amyloid therapies that have to prevent the trigger early in AD. Among the microglial genes,
triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has received much attention because a hemizygous
R47H variant of TREM2 (TREM2R47H) increases the AD risk by 2-7 folds in various populations, including African
American. Our preliminary single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNAseq) study identified disease-associated
microglia (DAM) with enhanced AD pro-inflammatory signatures (i.e., activation of Akt-signaling) associated with
the TREM2R47H variant and pharmacological Akt inhibition reversed the TREM2R47H induced inflammation,
showing proof-of-concept of TREM2R47H targeted drug discovery in AD. Using multimodal snRNAseq analysis,
we identified two approved anti-inflammatory asthma drugs (fluticasone and mometasone) that were predicted
to modulate DAM molecular networks are associated with a reduced incidence of AD in electronic health record
(EHR) data of 7 million patients. We therefore posit that understanding how the AD-linked mutations (i.e.,
TREM2R47H) enhance microglial toxicity could lead to understanding how microglia become maladaptive/toxic
and development of microglia-targeted therapeutic strategy for late-onset sporadic AD in general. This
application calls for novel microglia-targeted drug repurposing and combination therapies for AD using our
well-established multi-omics and deep learning-based EHR approaches, and functional observations in AD
patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), cerebral organoids, and mouse models, with three specific Aims.
Aim 1 will test the TREM2R47H informed microglia-targeted therapeutic hypothesis for identifying cell type-specific
molecular drivers/networks, repurposable drugs, and combination therapies for AD using multi-omics evidence
aggregation. These analyses will leverage our existing snRNAseq data (n = 24 TREM2R47H and n = 23 common
variant (CV)-TREM2 with matched age, AD pathology and APOE genotypes) and public genomic data from the
AD knowledge portal. Aim 2 will identify repurposable drugs and combination therapies using high-throughput
EHR-based hypothesis generation and sequential deep learning-based propensity score matching approaches.
We will leverage de-identified EHRs from the INSIGHT networks (~11 million patients across New York City’s 5
health systems and the greater metropolitan area). Aim 3 will screen, test and validate drugs using AD patient-
derived iPSC lines carrying TREM2R47H in conjunction with cerebral organoid and mouse models. The successful
completion of this project will offer a viable strategy to move AD drug repurposing from bench to bedside rapidly.

10814159,"Project Abstract
Community college students are an underserved and at-risk population in terms of sexual and relationship
health. Older adolescents/young adults consume a plethora of media messages, and many media messages
about sex and relationships are inaccurate and unhealthy. Consumption of unhealthy media messages (e.g.,
those that normalize or glamorize risky sex) is related to risky sexual behaviors. Media literacy education
(MLE), which aims to enhance critical thinking about media messages, is a novel and effective approach to
relationship and sexual health promotion. A recent evaluation of a MLE program for older adolescents, Media
Aware Sexual Health for Young Adults (MASH-YA), found that the program resulted in favorable short-term
effects on community college students’ (ages 18-19) sexual and relationship beliefs and behaviors, including a
reduction in risky sexual behaviors. While evidence supports the effectiveness of MLE, there are no studies that
have attempted to isolate its effects (i.e., enhancing critical thinking about media messages) on health
outcomes, and little is understood about the mechanisms underlying the relationship between MLE and sexual
health outcomes or the trajectory of MLE effects on sexual and relationship health over time. There are also
gaps in our understanding of the challenges surrounding the effective implementation of sexual health
programming at community colleges. Thus, this project proposes conducting a three-arm randomized control
trial with older adolescents (i.e., ages 18-19) attending community college (N=1680). Community college
campuses will be randomized to either the: (1) intervention group (i.e., MASH-YA); (2) active control group
(i.e., sexual health programming from MASH-YA without MLE content); or, (3) no-treatment control group.
Students will complete online questionnaires at pretest, posttest, 6m, and 12m follow-ups. The aims of this
project are to evaluate the incremental effects of MLE on primary and secondary sexual and relationship health
outcomes, compare the mechanisms underlying MASH-YA’s effects on health outcomes to the mechanisms
underlying the effects of the active control program, and evaluate the long-term efficacy of MASH-YA on
proximal and distal outcomes compared to an active control and no-treatment control. To assess challenges
faced by community colleges in implementing evidence-based sexual health programming and gather
information to inform strategies to enhance and support program implementation, community college
personnel (N=60) will be asked to review the MASH-YA program and complete a questionnaire and
structured interview to provide feedback on the program content and implementation. MLE is an effective
approach to sexual and relationship health promotion with the potential to reduce health disparities among
community college students. The findings from this study could advance theory, inform the development of
future MLE interventions, and provide a rigorous long-term evaluation of the first evidence-based MLE
program for sexual and relationship health promotion for older adolescents."

Abstract:
 Mouse Qa-1 is a member of the conserved MHC-E family of non-classical MHC-1 molecules (MHC1b). In
most cells, MHC-E presents peptides derived from the leader sequences of classical (MHC1a) molecules, and
regulates the function of NK cells through the germ-line encoded receptor CD94/NKG2. MHC-E molecules can
also present self and pathogen-derived peptides to CD8 T cells. The signals that lead to presentation of
alternative peptides by MHC-E, and the functions of the responding CD8 T cells remain poorly understood.
Recently, studies of a highly effective HIV vaccine based on a CMV vector revealed a prominent MHC-E
restricted CD8 T cell response, raising new interest in understanding the presentation mechanisms and in vivo
functions of MHC-E.
 Together with our collaborators, we have been investigating a Qa-1-restricted T cell response to cells
lacking the ER aminopeptidase associated with antigen processing (ERAAP ko) (Nagarajan et al., 2012). The
responding CD8 T cells recognize a 9-mer peptide derived from a self-protein (FL9 from FAM49) presented by
Qa-1(b) (called QFL T cells). QFL T cells use an invariant TCR a, and have characteristics of both
conventional and non-conventional CD8 T cells. Our preliminary data indicate that QFL T cells encounter high
affinity Qa-1 restricted ligands at steady state and during viral infection. We propose to use a newly generated
TCR transgenic mouse strain to probe the in vivo generation of Qa-1 restricted ligands for QFL T cells in both
steady state and during viral infection. In Aim 1, we will identify the pMHC ligands involved in positive and
agonist selection of QFL T cells, and will identify the thymic cell types that present the ligands. In Aim 2, we will
identify the ligand(s) that drive the homeostatic expansion of QFL T cells, and will determine when, in what
tissue, and by what cell type(s) they are presented. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanisms that lead to
priming of QFL T cells during MCMV infection, and will test whether QFL T cells induced during MCMV
infection can kill infected cells and provide immune protection.
 Our results will shed new light on how MHC-E presentation regulates T cell responses, with important
implications for vaccine design.

10814297,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a severe, irreversible neurodegenerative disease that involves asymmetric
symptoms. For most patients (over 85%) motor symptoms begin on one side of the body. This motor asymmetry
is so characteristic of PD that it is often used as a clinical parameter to differentiate PD from similar syndromes.
Though motor symptoms gradually become bilateral as the disease progresses, the initial asymmetry remains
stable and persists even at advanced disease stages. Lateralization in PD has been linked to rate of disease
progression and differences in the presentation of non-motor symptoms, including cognitive symptoms.
Symptom asymmetry in PD is the direct result of hemisphere differences in subcortical and cortical neuronal
dysfunction and loss. Despite the prevalence of asymmetric brain changes in PD and its importance to clinical
manifestations, the factors rendering neurons more vulnerable in one brain hemisphere over the other remain
one the most enigmatic puzzles of PD.
The goal of this study is to determine the molecular signatures enabling hemisphere differences in neuronal
dysfunction and symptom asymmetry in PD. In PD, both the development of neuropathology and the progressive
loss of neurons involve abnormalities in gene regulation. We have recently found evidence that hemisphere
asymmetry in PD neurons involves differences in epigenetic marks that relate to transcriptional states. We have
also found that neuronal epigenomes across hemispheres change with aging, a process that is accelerated in
PD. Therefore, we propose that hemisphere differences in epigenetic regulation of genes could underlie the
asymmetry in neuronal impairment, which in turn impacts symptom lateralization.
This project involves cutting-edge techniques in epigenomics and adjoining transcriptomic and genetic analyses
in isolated brain neurons of PD patients and controls. We also determine the impact of aging, rate of progression,
and PD pathology on the development of hemisphere asymmetry. Our project will define (i) the extent of
hemisphere asymmetry in the epigenome in neurons of PD patients, its effect on gene expression, and its
relevance to symptom lateralization, (ii) the divergence of the epigenome across hemispheres with aging, and
(iii) the capacity for PD neuropathology to induce epigenetic and transcriptional changes relevant to hemisphere
asymmetry in vivo. This work will identify the genes involved in asymmetric neuronal dysfunction in PD.
Uncovering the mechanisms involved in asymmetric brain changes in PD is important for understanding the
biological basis of symptom lateralization in PD. This work also provides fundamental insight on the degree of
molecular asymmetry across hemispheres of the human brain."

The lung transplant allocation system is not guided by an evidence-based strategy that accounts for the complex
interactions of donor and candidate characteristics missing an opportunity to maximize survival benefit from
utilization of the severely limited organ supply. To overcome this deficit, we will develop a donor-candidate risk
prediction system guided by traditional regression-based statistical techniques and modern machine learning
and artificial learning techniques focused on uncovering the impact of donor characteristics, variation in post-
transplant survival, and donor and candidate interactions. This goal will be accomplished by carrying out the
following three aims. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that incorporating donor characteristics improves
accuracy of prognostic models of recipient post-transplant survival. We will use regression-based and machine
learning approaches and compare the accuracy of the resultant survival models. In Aim 2, we will determine how
donor and candidate characteristics interact to introduce variation in post-transplant survival. Regression-based
and machine learning approaches will be used to identify and evaluate interactions, clustering, and effect
modification by waitlist time, illness severity, and functional status. In Aim 3, we will develop a machine learning/
artificial intelligence algorithm to inform organ allocation and acceptance decisions. Survival trade-offs will be
characterized using machine learning models to build an artificial intelligence allocation algorithm which will be
compared to historical decisions. In summary, the current US lung allocation system does not yet consider the
contribution of donor factors to post-transplant risk predictions which may explain why LAS-derived estimates of
survival benefit are inaccurate. Improved risk predictions would permit optimization of donor and candidate
matching to lay the framework for a system based on compatibility which has the potential to improve donor
utilization, waitlist survival, and post-transplant survival. Use of a staged modeling strategy combining traditional
regression-based approaches and modern machine learning and artificial intelligence methods will encourage
innovative solutions to problems in US lung allocation. This proposal's innovation is further augmented by a
uniquely qualified multi-disciplinary research team with expertise in analysis of complex systems and US lung
allocation policies."

As tumors progress, cancer cells acquire characteristics that allow them to adapt to various stresses. In fact,
one of the best predictors of patient outcome is disease stage at the time of diagnosis, as advanced tumors are
more aggressive and difficult to treat. However, the underlying mechanisms that potentiate increased cell
plasticity throughout cancer progression remain poorly understood. The ability of cancer cells to adapt has
posed a particular problem for the use of targeted therapies, which are frequently rendered ineffective by the
emergence of acquired resistance. The goal of this work is to elucidate molecular mechanisms that regulate
the cell cycle and cell fate decisions to influence cancer progression and resistance to targeted therapy. In the
F99 phase, I aim to identify novel factors that regulate the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway and influence the
cellular response to inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). CDK4/6, in complex with Cyclin
D, phosphorylate and inactivate the tumor suppressor RB to drive cell cycle progression. Recently developed
CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown some promise in the clinic, but every patient given these inhibitors eventually
progresses, creating an urgent need to identify mechanisms of resistance. Using an in vitro genome-wide
CRISPR/Cas9 screen, I recently identified loss of the E3 ligase adaptor AMBRA1 as a potential mechanism of
resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition. Further, AMBRA1 loss increased Cyclin D protein stability. I hypothesize that
AMBRA1, with its accompanying E3 ligase complex, targets Cyclin D for degradation, and that AMBRA1 loss
could be a mechanism of resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors in vivo. I will use molecular and biochemical assays
to identify the E3 ligase that cooperates with AMBRA1 to target Cyclin D. In addition, I will combine tumor
barcoding with multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting in mouse models of non-small cell lung
cancer to determine whether loss of AMBRA1 leads to CDK4/6 inhibitor resistance in vivo. In the K00 phase, I
aim to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating cell identity in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Treatment
of LUAD with small molecule inhibitors targeting mutant receptor tyrosine kinases can lead to relapsed tumors
that have transdifferentiated into small cell lung cancer, an aggressive neuroendocrine cancer with limited
treatment options. However, the mechanism of transdifferentiation is largely unknown. I propose to develop cell
line and mouse models of this transdifferentiation process in order to identify factors that regulate LUAD cell
identity and ultimately identify means to prevent or reverse transdifferentiation. Together, this body of work will
elucidate fundamental principles of acquired resistance and disease progression in lung cancer, which may
also be applicable to other cancer types."

Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases which can cleave proteins containing cleavage sites on the flexible
region to trigger cell death through apoptosis or pyroptosis. Recently, bifunctional small molecules, such as
proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), lysosome targeting chimeras (LYTACs), or autophagy targeting
chimeras (AUTACs), have emerged as potential therapeutic modalities by hijacking the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (UPS), lysosome or autophagy to degrade proteins of interest (POIs). Caspase cleavage is a one-step
process that instantly terminate protein function. Here, we discovered that piperlongumine (PL), a dietary natural
product, can recruit caspase(s) to cleave Bcl-xL when conjugated with a Bcl-xL/2 inhibitor ABT263. This finding
motivated us to further develop bifunctional small molecules for targeted protein cleavage by recruiting caspases,
which could be superior to or complementary to the known degraders. We termed this kind of compounds
caspase cleavage targeting chimeras (CACTACs). In this proposal, we will apply a series of state-of-the-art
technologies to find the caspase(s) recruited by the current PL-based Bcl-xL CACTAC and confirm the
mechanism of action. In addition, we will build a Halo-FKBP system to further genetically explore the potential of
CACTAC-mediated targeted protein cleavage by various caspases. The caspase-cleavage site pairs will be
systematically identified to inform the future CACTAC design. We will also further develop new caspase-2
recruiters through PL analog library screening and structure/computer modeling-based optimization. More
CACTACs targeting other POIs will be synthesized and tested to expand the application of CACTACs. The
CACTAC platform proposed here will offer a revolutionary weapon against oncoproteins for cancer therapy."

 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the single most common and lethal type of lung fibrosis of unknown
cause, which starts with the build-up of scar tissue from the edges of the lung, and advances toward the inside
center over time. This intriguing edge-to-center fibrotic progression suggest the presence of unique biological
or physical cues in the lung periphery that initiate the disease, the study of which is still in its infancy. Given the
fact that few treatment options are available once interstitial fibrosis develops, early diagnosis and treatment
are thus critically important, which is hindered by our poor knowledge on the etiology of fibrotic progression.
 By using cutting-edge technologies including lineage tracing, mouse modeling and multimodal single cell
sequencing, Dr. Xu found that elevated mechanical tension drives the differentiation of a novel population of
fibroblasts in the lung periphery, leading to the subpleural fibrosis. These fibroblasts are characterized by
expression of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1), signatures of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), and secretion of
multiple kinds of chemokines and cytokines. Fibrosis progression is achieved through additional lung injury,
suggesting that a synergistic effort between these WT1+ subpleural fibroblasts and injured epithelial cells may
drive the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. These preliminary data raised the Central Hypothesis that WT1+
subpleural fibroblasts function as a stromal niche that drives the progression of pulmonary fibrosis,
which will be rigorously tested here in three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To determine the cellular origins and molecular drivers of WT1+ SPFBs [K99]
To address the progenitors of WT1+ SPFBs, and transcription factors that drive their induction.
Aim 2. To determine if WT1+ SPFBs act as a stromal niche to promote fibrosis progression [K99/R00]
To address the biological roles of WT1+ SPFBs in promoting fibrosis progression.
Aim 3. To determine if the recruitment and function of myeloid cells in the subpleural region promote
pulmonary fibrosis progression [R00]
To address the contribution of subpleural myeloid cells, which are hypothesized to be recruited by WT1+
SPFBs, to fibrosis progression.
 Dr. Xu is well on track towards his career goal as an independent investigator, evidenced by his
multidiscipline training record and academic productivity. To accomplish this, he will receive support from his
outstanding and complementary mentor committee, including Dr. Xin Sun (primary mentor), Dr. Zea Borok (co-
mentor, lung fibrosis), Dr. Laura Alexander (co-mentor, immunology) and Dr. Kyle Gaulton (co-mentor,

10785393,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects more than 5.8 million elderly adults and is the most fatal
dementia in the US. Patients diagnosed with AD present with cognitive decline including a loss in
long-term memory. Perceptual memory is encoded on the synchronous firing of cells within a
cortical network, and ensemble activity can be recalled with sensory cues, or it can be reactivated
spontaneously during sleep. During sleep, the brain is placed in a quiescent state of slow-wave
activity, where recently acquired memories are believed to spontaneously reactivate in order to
consolidate into long-term storage. Human AD patients show memory deficits along with poor and
fragmented sleep. Due to impairments in long term memory and sleep in AD patients and animal
models, it is theorized that memory reactivation may also be impaired in AD. At this point memory
reactivation has not been studied during sleep in AD. Animal studies where memory reactivation
is artificially disrupted show memory deficits, and interestingly, animal research has demonstrated
that spurring additional memory reactivation during sleep can improve memory consolidation.
Interestingly, even the introduction of auditory stimulation to enhance slow-wave activity during
sleep has been shown to aid the retention of new memories. In a recent study, stimulating slow-
wave activity during sleep in human patients with mild cognitive impairments led to increases in
memory retention. The overall goal of this proposal is to gauge memory reactivation in a mouse
model of Alzheimer’s disease and to stimulate memory reactivation during sleep in AD mice to
increase memory performance. I will use two-photon microscopy in parallel with recordings of
electrophysiology to measure brain activity across wake and sleep. AD model animals will be
imaged during sleep following a learning task to test the hypothesis that memory reactivation is
impaired in an AD mouse model (Aim 1). In a separate set of experiments, the stimulation of virally
delivered opsins will be used to spur additional memory reactivation in sleep following a learning
task to test the hypothesis that spurring memory reactivation during sleep will improve memory in
a mouse model of AD (Aim 2). The conclusion of this project will determine the specific alterations
in memory reactivation during sleep contributing to memory deficits found in an AD mouse model,
and identify the potential to modulate network activity during sleep to rescue memory deficits in a
mouse model of AD. The completion of this preclinical research may influence early diagnosis of
AD and lead to innovations of novel therapeutics for AD. Through the completion of this project, I
will be exposed to training in optical techniques, electrophysiology, behavior, and sleep science
in preclinical animal models to become an independent research scientist."

Project summary
Older adults experience the greatest burden of respiratory virus infections, especially influenza
viruses. Older adults are recommended for annual influenza vaccination due the high
morbidity in this age group, yet underperformance of standard inactivated vaccines has led to
the recommendation of enhanced vaccines, which include high dose, HA only or adjuvanted
formulations to improve immunogenicity. However, there is still no consensus on preferred
formulation in older adults despite their recommendation, and up to 80% of older adults fail to
seroconvert after vaccination. Age impacts the ability to prime new immune responses to
antigenic drift variants of influenza viruses, due to reduced immune functions and competition
of existing responses for subtle changes in new vaccine strains, which is compounded by
annual vaccination. Here, in this study we plan to leverage our completed 4-year randomised
control trial in older adults of standard versus enhanced influenza vaccines, to determine the
combination and longitudinal repeated effect of vaccination on the antibody and cellular
response. Our initial studies have found adjuvanted vaccines increase total T follicular helper
cells increasing the magnitude, avidity, and cross-reactivity of the antibody response.
Therefore, we plan to use mutational profiling of influenza viruses grown in the presence of
vaccine serum across different conditions to assess the antigenic focussing and mutational
pressure generated. The quality of antibody responses will be assessed in multiplex
approaches. Whilst cytokine producing T cell responses are minimally boosted by inactivated
vaccines, we found a year 1 advantage of adjuvanted vaccines for CD8+ T cells which was
diminished by year 4 of the study. High dimensional flow cytometry, antigen specific probes
for T and B cells, and in vitro stimulation will be used to characterise the phenotype and
function of innate and adaptive cellular responses, including repertoire shaped by repeat
vaccination. Innate, T and B cell responses will be assessed at the molecular level by
repertoire analysis, and transcriptional activity by 10X scRNAseq, with a focus on participants
that fail to seroconvert by standard HAI antibodies as their T cell responses come to the fore.
Ultimately, this study will provide rationale for vaccine use in older adults and universal vaccine
development for broadly cross-reactive immunity.

Rickettsiales are a diverse order of obligate, intracellular bacteria often transmitted by arthropods and pose a
substantial threat to public health. Rickettsial organisms manipulate a wide array of host cell processes to gain
entry and establish a replicative niche, while simultaneously avoiding host cell defenses. How rickettsial
pathogens mediate this complex network of interactions is not well understood. A central feature of all rickettsial
pathogens is the Type 4 Secretion System (T4SS), which secretes effector proteins into the cytosol and
manipulates biological processes in the host cell. However, few T4SS translocated effectors have been identified
or characterized from rickettsial organisms owing, in part, to the lack of genetic tools available among these
bacteria. Their obligate intracellular nature has historically hindered genetic manipulation of Rickettsiales.
Recently, we achieved targeted gene deletion in the rickettsial pathogen A. phagocytophilum using allelic
exchange by homologous recombination. In the R61 portion of this proposal we will leverage this technique to
add to the A. phagocytophilum genetic toolbox by developing 1) a T4SS effector translocation assay for use in
the organism of study, 2) conditional expression systems, and 3) luminescent reporters. Using these tools in the
R33 phase we will: 4) characterize the A. phagocytophilum T4SS effector repertoire, 5) evaluate the contributions
of essential A. phagocytophilum effectors to infection, and 6) monitor the expression kinetics of effectors in vivo.
The objectives of this proposal will expand the tractability of A. phagocytophilum and our understanding of the
host-pathogen interactions it navigates during infection through elucidation to the T4 effector repertoire, and an
understanding of how, when and where these genes are regulated. The impact of this proposal will extend to
other rickettsial organisms, as these approaches can be adapted for use in related intracellular pathogens."

Imaging of macrophage trafficking can reveal important molecular, cellular, and functional characteristics of the
host tissue and support the discovery of new biomarkers for improved diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment
monitoring. Over the past years, macrophage imaging using different modalities has undergone significant
development, however existing modalities offer suboptimal tradeoffs between depth of penetration, specificity,
sensitivity, and resolution. Although ultrasound (US) could potentially address this challenge, while also providing
portable assessment (e.g., in an outpatient setting) at potentially lower costs, there is a paucity of investigations
using ultrasound for macrophage imaging. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that labelling macrophages
with microbubble (MB) ultrasound contrast agents to augment their contrast can enable imaging of macrophage
trafficking with high sensitivity deep into tissues without compromising resolution. To test the above hypothesis,
first the detection limit of MB-labeled macrophages under different US imaging pulse sequencies will be
determined (in vitro). After identifying the minimum number of MB-labeled macrophages that can be detected in
vitro, the sensitivity of imaging MB labeled macrophages with US in healthy mice (in vivo) will be assessed next.
Finally, as a proof of concept, the ability to monitor macrophage trafficking to diseased organ and to facilitate
diagnosis will be assessed in the context of solid tumors (in tumors). If successful, the proposed research will
provide a novel framework for macrophage imaging and tracking using ultrasound to support the discovery and
clinical translation of new US methods and technology for macrophage-based diagnostics and therapy
monitoring."

The field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is entering a new era where increasing numbers of novel treatments
targeting the biological underpinnings of AD will be available within the foreseeable future. If we fail to identify
cognitive impairment due to AD early, we will miss an important treatment window. There is a critical need for
easily accessible, scalable, and sensitive cognitive tools that can aid early detection and monitoring of
cognitive impairment and thereby allow earlier intervention to mitigate further decline. High quality, brief
cognitive assessment tools that can be deployed remotely or via self-administration in clinic settings represent
one key component of the future of AD research and clinical practice. These tools will help enrich clinical trials
and aid triage decisions to inform specialty clinic referrals and initiation of treatment in clinics, ideally in
conjunction with plasma biomarkers to address both clinical symptoms and underlying biology. Additional
validation of novel remote cognitive assessment tools is needed. Mayo Test Development through Rapid
Iteration, Validation and Expansion (Mayo Test Drive, MTD) is a cognitive testing platform developed for self-
administered digital cognitive assessment. MTD addresses remote assessment needs and is a multi-device
(smartphone, tablet, PC), flexible and easily accessible platform, with subtests that provide more in-depth
assessment of targeted cognitive domains relative to typical screening tests. The MTD brief cognitive
screening battery takes 15-20 minutes and includes 2 subtests: (1) the Stricker Learning Span (SLS), a novel
computer adaptive word list memory test (learning and delay trials) and (2) Symbols Test, an open-source
measure of visual matching and processing speed/executive function; these are combined into a screening
battery composite (MTD-SBC). The overall goal of this R01 is to establish the validity of the MTD-SBC and the
SLS for several specific contexts of use. Specific aims are to (1) determine cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy
of MTD for clinically defined and PET biomarker-defined groups, (2) demonstrate sensitivity of MTD to amyloid-
related cognitive decline over 30 months, (3) determine utility of MTD for detecting clinical progression over 45
months, and (4) determine whether MTD performance is associated with plasma biomarkers to a similar
degree as in-person neuropsychological measures. Most participants will be recruited from the Mayo Clinic
Study of Aging, with additional recruitment from the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Rochester, MN and
Jacksonville, FL) and the Memory Impairment and Neurodegenerative Dementia Center - Mayo Clinic Study of
Aging at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, MS (N=2,300 across cohorts, predominantly
remote administration). By increasing the representation of diverse participants and the range of social and

to complete exploratory analyses for Aim 4 focused on whether SSDoH moderates these results. Future
research will determine the combined utility of MTD and plasma biomarkers."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a fatal disease without a cure. Understanding its neuromechanisms is a top
research priority as it may provide regional targets for early intervention or for monitoring disease progression.
Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is a fundamental physiological parameter indicating regional brain function as well
as brain vascular integrity and has been increasingly adopted to evaluate AD related functional and
neurovascular alterations. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI is the only non-invasive non-radioactive
approach to quantify regional CBF. It can be incorporated into multi-modal MRI protocols routinely acquired in
patients with cognitive symptoms and can be repeated many times without risk, which is very appealing to AD
and other basic, translational, and clinical research. Although ASL has shown a great promise in AD
characterization and differential diagnosis, its full potential and impact are still hampered by three major
limitations of current ASL techniques: the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), low spatial resolution, and
long scan time. Theoretically these problems are in direct conflict and there is no analytical way to address
them in a single scheme. In this project, we aim to solve this analytically insurmountable challenge using the
state-of-art artificial intelligence technique, deep machine learning (DL). We will use a divide-and-conquer
strategy to address each of the three limitations separately to delineate the effects of different learning
strategies and ASL data properties. Domain expert knowledge about ASL MRI will be used to guide DL
algorithm design or to augment the learning and prediction process to achieve better performance and
reliability. Using these methods, we expect to see a significant increase of SNR and spatial resolution, and a
substantial reduction of ASL MRI data acquisition time. To show clinical importance, we will apply the proposed
methods to existing ASL MRI data from subjects with clinical and preclinical AD. We expect to see increased
sensitivity of ASL CBF for detecting the AD specific hypoperfusion patterns, monitoring disease progression,
and detecting the CBF versus memory associations. The proposed suite of DL methods will not only benefit
the AD research community but also have a wide range of basic, translational, and clinical neuroscience
applications to which robust and high-resolution CBF mapping can contribute. To disseminate those benefits,
we will release the code through our widely used toolbox for processing ASL data: ASLtbx. Feasibility of this
highly novel but very important project is ensured by our decades of research experience in ASL MRI and AD
and substantial preliminary data."

CRISPR technology have massively expanded our ability to interrogate the genetic mechanisms of cancer and
define therapeutic avenues. Techniques have evolved over the past five years for the generation of massive
scale CRISPR genetic screens linked to single cell transcriptomics. However, the ability to perform such
screen in vivo in genetically engineered models remains cumbersome. Over the past several years, we have
pioneered an electroporation-based somatic mutation method for rapid, non-invasive, somatic transgenesis for
high throughput validation of tumor driver genes using mosaic analysis with dual recombinase-mediated
cassette exchange (MADR). The central theme of this grant application is to generate, optimize, and validate
MADR Perturb-seq—a novel suite of genetic tools that facilitate massive scale genetic screens in the context
of both in vivo murine somatic transgenesis as well as inducible editing in human iPSC-derived organoids.
We will exploit our experience with electroporation based modeling to rapidly optimize and empirically test
MADR Perturb-seq. The overall objective of the proposal is to perform advanced development of this
combined MADR-CRISPR approach to allow for generalized use in diverse tumor contexts and, therefore,
demonstrate the potential of this technology to transform cancer research.
We propose to carry out this work in three parts. The focus of Specific Aim 1 is to Optimize CRISPR
elements, ORFs, and molecular barcodes for use with somatic transgenic patient-derived tumor signatures and
validate genetic tools for enabling multiplex genetic screens in an off the shelf CRISPR/Cas9 mouse. The
main goal of Specific Aim 2 is to validate MADR multiplexing screening in vivo at scale . Finally, in Aim 3, we
will engineer approaches for highly multiplexed genetic screens using MADR combined with inducible
elements and/or virally-delivered MADR elements in human engineered iPSCs. Successful completion of
these experiments will yield unprecedented capabilities for genetically screening tumor mechanisms and
potential therapeutic weaknesses."
10800717,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most heterogeneous disorders in psychiatry and first line

Improving our understanding of MDD subtypes will allow us to (1) identify treatments that target subtype-
specific pathophysiology and (2) determine which subgroup of MDD patients will best respond to these
treatments, thus improving antidepressant outcomes. In a neuroinflammatory subtype, MDD may manifest via
chronic neuroinflammation. The translocator protein (TSPO), located on the outer mitochondrial membrane of
microglia and astrocytes, is regarded as a marker of this neuroinflammation and can be measured in vivo by
positron emission tomography (PET). In support of a neuroinflammatory subtype of MDD, TSPO, measured by
PET, was found to be elevated by 30% on average in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in MDD relative to healthy
individuals. Further, we have preliminary data from a repeated social defeat stress mouse model that shows
elevated PFC TSPO and other elevated neuroinflammation markers in a subset of ‘depressed’, non-resilient
mice, and that this phenotype is reversed by elimination of TSPO expressing glial cells! To parallel this effect
in humans, brain-penetrant anti-inflammatory medications such as celecoxib can be used. Celecoxib has
antidepressant effects in MDD; however, the observed effect sizes are highly variable, likely reflecting the
biological heterogeneity of MDD. We hypothesize that anti-inflammatory treatments such as celecoxib will be
most effective in those with the neuroinflammatory subtype of MDD and that the mechanism of antidepressant
action is through a reduction of neuroinflammation. We will test these hypotheses in parallel studies in humans
in rodents. For the human aim, we will take advantage of an ongoing study of celecoxib efficacy currently being
performed at Stony Brook Medicine (PI: Parsey) by recruiting participants who are already being treated with
celecoxib (8 weeks, 400mg/day). 53 MDD participants will be enrolled, with 42 expected to complete the study
involving TSPO PET imaging before and after treatment. We hypothesize that higher PFC TSPO (as
measured by PET) prior to treatment will be correlated with better response to celecoxib and further, that
reductions in PFC TSPO will be correlated to depression improvement after adjusting for covariates. In a
parallel study in rodents, we hypothesize that PFC TSPO and other CNS inflammation markers in our repeated
social defeat stress mouse model of depression will be elevated as measured by microPET, quantitative
protein/mRNA level analysis, and reactive microglial morphology, when compared to wild type mice. Further,
we hypothesize that elevated PFC TSPO and other neuroinflammatory markers will be reduced after celecoxib
treatment. If mouse and human studies do not agree, this suggests that TSPO PET provides a clinically-
relevant proxy of neuroinflammation. However, if our hypotheses are confirmed, this would validate that TSPO
is a marker of the neuroinflammatory MDD subtype and a target of treatment."

individuals. Further, we have preliminary data from a repeated social defeat stress mouse model that shows
elevated PFC TSPO and other elevated neuroinflammation markers in a subset of ‘depressed’, non-resilient
mice, and that this phenotype is reversed by elimination of TSPO expressing glial cells! To parallel this effect
in humans, brain-penetrant anti-inflammatory medications such as celecoxib can be used. Celecoxib has
antidepressant effects in MDD; however, the observed effect sizes are highly variable, likely reflecting the
biological heterogeneity of MDD. We hypothesize that anti-inflammatory treatments such as celecoxib will be
most effective in those with the neuroinflammatory subtype of MDD and that the mechanism of antidepressant
action is through a reduction of neuroinflammation. We will test these hypotheses in parallel studies in humans
in rodents. For the human aim, we will take advantage of an ongoing study of celecoxib efficacy currently being
performed at Stony Brook Medicine (PI: Parsey) by recruiting participants who are already being treated with
celecoxib (8 weeks, 400mg/day). 53 MDD participants will be enrolled, with 42 expected to complete the study
involving TSPO PET imaging before and after treatment. We hypothesize that higher PFC TSPO (as
measured by PET) prior to treatment will be correlated with better response to celecoxib and further, that
reductions in PFC TSPO will be correlated to depression improvement after adjusting for covariates. In a
parallel study in rodents, we hypothesize that PFC TSPO and other CNS inflammation markers in our repeated
social defeat stress mouse model of depression will be elevated as measured by microPET, quantitative
protein/mRNA level analysis, and reactive microglial morphology, when compared to wild type mice. Further,
we hypothesize that elevated PFC TSPO and other neuroinflammatory markers will be reduced after celecoxib
treatment. If mouse and human studies do not agree, this suggests that TSPO PET provides a clinically-
relevant proxy of neuroinflammation. However, if our hypotheses are confirmed, this would validate that TSPO
is a marker of the neuroinflammatory MDD subtype and a target of treatment."

The Mutant Mouse Resource and Research Center (MMRRC) is the nation’s primary mutant mouse archive
and distribution repository system, the primary goal of which is to facilitate research by identifying, acquiring,
evaluating, characterizing, cryopreserving, and distributing mutant mouse strains to qualified biomedical
investigators. The MMRRC was established by the NIH to ensure the preservation, dissemination, and
development of valuable mutant mouse lines and data generated by research scientists. The MMRRC is a
consortium of four Centers, each hosting an archive and distribution repository, and an Informatics
Coordination and Service Center (ICSC) within a trans-national network regionally distributed across the
United States. The Centers collectively serve the needs of the nation’s biomedical research community,
ensuring access to and optimizing utilization of transgenic, knockout, and other genetically engineered mutant
mice and related biomaterials, services, and new technologies. The Centers import, verify, maintain, and
distribute mice, gene-targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells, and germplasm of genetically unique, scientifically
valuable mice. Centers also provide services and procedures to assist investigators using genetically altered
mice for research. Finally, Centers conduct resource-related research, often collaboratively, to further refine
and develop mutant mouse lines and capitalize on the power of mouse genetics for biomedical research. By
depositing their mutant mice in repositories at the Centers, NIH-funded investigators fulfill their obligation under
the NIH Sharing Policy. In return, each of the Centers strives to preserve, protect, quality control, and provide
these models for the benefit of research scientists and investigators across the nation and the globe. In doing
so, the MMRRC ensures that valuable mutant mouse lines are available equitably across the biomedical

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance) was founded on July 15, 2011, through the
merger of 3 legacy groups: Cancer and Leukemia Group B, North Central Cancer Treatment
Group, and American College of Surgeons Oncology Group. The Alliance Statistics and Data
Management Center (SDMC) is responsible for all statistics, data management, and Information
Technology functions for the Alliance and, as such, is an integral part of the Alliance's mission.
Despite being formed from 3 distinctive groups, all SDMC activities are now consolidated at a
single location at the Mayo Clinic under the leadership of Dr. Sumithra Mandrekar as the
Alliance Group Statistician, all while undergoing a leadership transition due to the untimely
death of the previous group statistician, Dr. Daniel Sargent. Alliance faculty includes
methodological leaders in biomarker-based clinical trial design, adaptive trials, surrogate
endpoint evaluations, development of methodology and computing tools for identification of
predictive genomic markers, and early-stage clinical trial design. From March 1, 2014 – August
31, 2017, the SDMC provided statistical, data management, and IT collaboration for 20
treatment trials currently in development, 21 treatment trials that opened to accrual and, 100
trials that opened prior to March 2014, for which patient follow-up or manuscript preparation is
in progress. SDMC members were authors on 234 published manuscripts reporting on Alliance-
led clinical trials and associated correlative or retrospective studies, authored an additional 149
reviews, editorials, or position papers on novel statistical and bioinformatics methods, analyses
and software, and provided substantial statistical support and leadership on 44 publications
which leverage individual patient data from multiple Alliance studies. SDMC systems are robust
and scalable and support all needs of the Alliance. The SDMC has implemented Medidata Rave
for all trials, consolidated to a single information systems infrastructure, met all NCI OEWG
timelines, collaborated on international trials, partnered on prospective and retrospective
registration trials, and is leading the ALCHEMIST trial, A151216 (part of the NCI precision
medicine initiative). The SDMC has contributed to several national NCTN systems initiatives:
piloting of the ePRO system, Source Data Verification, integrations between Rave and CTEP-
AERs, implementing the Data Quality Portal and Central Monitoring Portal, and partnering on
the NCTN Biospecimen Navigator. The Alliance SDMC has kept pace with, and in many cases
led, innovation in scientific, administrative, and technological arenas of cancer research, and is

10930115,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The opioid crisis is a major public health problem in the United States. Over the past two decades, opioid use
and abuse have increased dramatically, with over 5 million people in the United States using prescription
analgesics without medical need or prescription. This has resulted in a significant increase in opioid-related
deaths and addiction rates, with the crisis having a profound impact on individuals, families, and communities.
The proposal aims to develop machine learning-based predictive models for opioid use disorder (OUD)
leveraging genomic, social, and clinical factors. The project will utilize the diverse and equitable AllOfUs
database to identify novel genomic markers associated with OUD in patients with and without co-existing pain
conditions. A significant advantage of the AllOfUs database is the diversity of the patient population and clinical
samples – over 50% of the population is considered underrepresented. This will be achieved through genome-
wide association analysis to identify novel single nucleotide variants, copy number variants, and/or structural
variants. The project will also use machine learning techniques to develop predictive models that classify the risk
of OUD, integrating various data types such as clinical factors, social factors, and genomic data. The project
aims to identify key features that aid in the development of improved models for predicting the risk of OUD.
The first specific aim of the proposal is to identify associations between genomic profiles and OUD. The project
will focus on patients with or without co-existing pain conditions and identify novel genetic markers associated
with OUD in each of these unique patient populations.
The second specific aim is to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to classify the risk
of OUD. The models will integrate social, clinical, and genomic data to provide clinicians with a tool to risk stratify
their patients.
The project aims to develop robust machine learning-based models predicting OUD and visualize the individual
features' impacts on model performance to provide understanding of which factors are most impactful to
predicting the outcome."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been termed the “signature injury” of the recent military conflicts
in Iraq, with incidence estimated between 9-28%. While the vast majority of TBIs are mild, long-
term effects can persist years post-injury. TBI can impact psychological health, physical health,
functioning, and quality of life, but predicting outcome post-injury is challenging. Large sample
sizes are necessary to accurately characterize heterogeneity in outcome, and two on-going
longitudinal studies have collected in-depth data with the goal of improving Service Member and
Veteran (SMV) health. Long-term Impact of Military-relevant Brain Injury Consortium (LIMBIC)
and Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) collectively have
gathered information on thousands of SMVs around the United States, and combining these
datasets will give us unprecedented power to examine factors that influence outcome post-
injury. This Proof of Concept (POC) project will demonstrate the feasibility of combining these
massive samples and will show the power of large datasets. Together, TRACTS and LIMBIC
have information on TBI severity, physiologic functioning, fluid, and imaging biomarkers,
behavioral factors, functional outcomes, and mental health outcomes on approximately 3,500
individuals, and our team has significant experience in collating and organizing large amounts of
data and applying harmonization methods to imaging, fluid biomarker, and clinical endpoint
data. With the expertise of our project team, we will pool and harmonize data for integrated
analyses. Combining and harmonizing data from different sources has many challenges, but the
project team has extensive, interdisciplinary expertise, particularly in the area of big data
analytics. Neuropsychological data will be combined by domain. Crosswalks and common
analytical methods will be created for both multimodal magnetic resonance imaging data (MRI)
and fluid biomarker data. MRI data will be harmonized using ComBat-GAM to minimize site
effects. Fluid biomarkers will be combined utilizing harmonization methods to integrate multi-
omic markers using newer methods including deep learning (DL) algorithms. Using the
biomarker data as independent variables and the cognitive and function data as dependent
variables, risk factors associated with brain disorders and recovery will be identified. Given
large, rich datasets, machine learning approaches can help outline symptom profiles, but careful
curation of datasets is critical to ensuring validity. Beyond the massive dataset generated by this
POC project, by creating and validating methods for combining multi-site data, a critical
deliverable will be the infrastructure for future cross-study analyses. The end goal of this project
is to leverage the vast amount of information available regarding TBI and SMV health to identify
generalizable biomarkers of outcome that can inform patient-tailored care and thus decrease
TBI-related morbidity."
10816824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a class of thousands of toxic compounds that have
been found in drinking water sources in 34 US states and in the blood of 97% of people tested. Exposure to
PFAS has been linked to immune toxicity, cancer, high cholesterol, and several other health effects. More than
57,000 sites across the US are estimated to have PFAS pollution, and the total remediation market is estimated
at $160 billion. Adsorption technologies are widely used for removing PFAS from water sources, but these
produce secondary waste in the form of PFAS-laden spent sorbent media or complex regenerate solutions.
Disposal or incineration of this secondary waste is costly and becoming highly regulated or even banned in some
states. Enspired Solutions is commercializing a patented PFAS destruction technology called micelle-
accelerated photoactivated reductive defluorination (PRD). We are developing a micelle-accelerated PRD
reactor to degrade PFAS on spent ion exchange (IX) resin and regenerate the resin for further PFAS removal.
The commercial system is the size of two large refrigerators, fully automated and modular to accommodate site-
specific flow rates of 1,000 to 1,000,000 gallons per day of water contaminated with ng/L to µg/L concentrations
of PFAS. Treatment cost estimates are competitive with PFAS capture and disposal. Our proprietary chemical
formulation traps PFAS in solution inside a micelle, where an electron donor generates a hydrated electron upon
exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. The hydrated electron breaks the carbon-fluorine bonds of PFAS molecules,
which degrades them to environmentally benign by-products. Compared to other PFAS destruction technologies,
micelle-accelerated PRD is more efficient, safer and requires a smaller footprint. When paired with suspended
spent IX resin, the positively charged resin surface can localize PFAS and our electron donor for selective PFAS
destruction. Any PFAS that desorbs from the resin will be captured in a micelle in solution and similarly degraded.
Bench scale micelle-accelerated PRD reactions will be performed on suspensions of IX resin loaded with PFAS
from a synthetic solution. Defluorination of PFAS will be monitored in real time as a function of UV dose and
confirmed with individual PFAS compound analysis. Reaction conditions will be optimized to achieve ≥ 99% (two
orders of magnitude) PFAS destruction. We will test the reusability of the resins after micelle-accelerated PRD
by measuring the adsorption capacity after regeneration, targeting 60 – 80 % capacity retention after each
regeneration cycle. In Phase II, we will test the reaction with a range of real PFAS-laden wastewater samples,
which will have complex matrices and a broader range of PFAS compounds. We will also expand testing to other
media used for PFAS adsorption (ionomers, biochar, modified cornstarch, etc.) and larger sample volumes. This
system will provide a complete, on-site PFAS capture plus destruction solution that will eliminate secondary
waste generation and put an end to the spread of PFAS."

Globally, 2.7 million children are living with HIV and over 90% of them live in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV
subtypes A, C and D are predominant. In adults, HIV subtypes differ in virulence and transmissibility, but whether
the same is true in children is unknown. We have shown that viral fitness as measured by viral replication capacity
(VRC) is correlated with markers of clinical disease progression, CD4+T cell loss, proviral HIV DNA load and
inflammation in adults. Moreover, an HIV subtype hierarchy in VRC exists that is consistent with reported
differences in the rate of disease progression. The role of viral specific features on immunologic and clinical
outcomes in children with perinatal HIV (CPHIV), and on proviral DNA reservoir size, the main target in HIV cure
strategies, are unknown and a significant gap in our knowledge of pediatric HIV pathogenesis. Perinatal HIV
progresses much faster than acute HIV in adults, but a small portion of children with perinatal HIV (CPHIV)
maintain healthy CD4 levels in the presence of viremia and have been termed pediatric nonprogressors (PNP).
Study of this unique population of CPHIV may provide clues into the pathogenic factors that drive rapid disease
progression or intrinsic viral or host factors that slow disease progression. The goal of our proposed study is to
determine whether viral subtypes and VRC shape immune profiles and clinical outcomes in perinatal HIV. We
will compare virologic and immunologic factors in PNP and slow progressors (SP) with pediatric progressors
(PP) to elucidate pathogen- and host-specific mediators disease progression. We will leverage a biobank and
corresponding immune database from the Pediatric Immune Activation (PIA) study that enrolled 156 CPHIV
(including a subset of SP and PNP) and 82 children who were unexposed to HIV between 2011-2012 in Kenya.
In Aim 1 we will identify viral subtypes and quantify VRC in viremic participants and determine associations with
markers of HIV disease progression and proviral reservoir size. In Aim 2 we will probe whether viral subtypes
and VRC are linked to inflammatory or exhausted immune profiles and HIV-specific T cell functions. In the last
aim we will develop predictive mathematical models of perinatal HIV disease progression using individual
virologic and immunologic profiles. Our paired virologic and immunologic measures and clinical outcome data
combined with personalized computational models of clinical outcomes will identify protective viral and immune
factors that mitigate perinatal HIV disease progression and proviral reservoir size. Our multidisciplinary research
will fill fundamental knowledge gaps in how virologic factors shape pediatric HIV immunopathogenesis and
disease progression and may stimulate innovative approaches towards HIV remission in children with perinatal
HIV."
10816869,"Abstract
The prevalence of atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma are increasing at high rates that
can't be explained by purely genetic etiology, indicating the roles of environmental exposures in increasing
disease risk. Environmental exposures that alter the risk of allergic diseases (farm exposure, C-section, breast
feeding, antibiotic exposure) also influence microbial colonization. Altered microbial composition (aka dysbiosis)
at mucosal surfaces, specifically within the perinatal period (<1 year of life) has been linked to increased risk for
developing several atopic diseases. Interestingly, atopic diseases are also associated with epithelial barrier
dysfunction. Our preliminary data suggest that perinatal dysbiosis is associated with 1) increase in allergen-
induced pulmonary responses; 2) a period of increased skin permeability (barrier dysfunction) extending even
after resolution of immediate dysbiosis; 3) significant alterations in gene expression in the skin of dysbiotic
animals, including dampened TNFα signaling, and predominantly Th2 biased transcriptomic profiles.
Interestingly, an isolate of gram negative commensal Roseomonas mucosa identified from healthy volunteers
(RMhv) was associated with increased skin barrier function and clinical benefits demonstrated by mouse studies
and clinical trials. RMhv-induced improvement in skin barrier function were linked to elevated TNF-related
epithelial repair mechanism. Therefore, we hypothesize that by impairing skin barrier function, perinatal dysbiosis
can exacerbate sensitivity to the development of skin-associated allergic diseases, and that treatment with a
clinically relevant Roseomonas mucosa bacterial isolate is sufficient to protect mice from perinatal dysbiosis-
associated defects in skin barrier function. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims: (1) To determine if perinatal
dysbiosis alters susceptibility to the development of skin-associated allergic diseases; (2) To determine if a
clinically relevant Roseomonas mucosa isolate identified from healthy volunteers can protect mice against
perinatal dysbiosis associated skin barrier dysfunction and house dust mite allergen -induced allergic diseases.
Collectively, these studies will elucidate the mechanisms by which perinatal dysbiosis influences skin barrier
function and associated allergic diseases."

 With modern advances in medicine, our average lifespan is increasing. However, advanced age is
often accompanied by chronic diseases Our immune systems frequently plays a central role in the
development of chronic diseases and T cells play a critical role in the immune system, providing protection
against infection and cancer. The thymus, the primary organ for T cell development, however, undergoes a
profound age-dependent atrophy, a process called thymic involution. Thymic involution results in T cell
immunodeficiency, leading to increased susceptibility to infection and cancer, and difficulty in establishing
protective immunity via vaccinations. Currently, there is no effective way to prevent or reverse T cell
immunodeficiency among older adults. T cell development in the thymus is dependent on the thymic
microenvironment, in which thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are the major components. However, TECs undergo
qualitative and quantitative loss that is the major factor responsible for thymic atrophy.
 FOXN1 is a pivotal regulator for TEC development and maintenance, and we have shown that
recombinant (r) FOXN1 fusion protein that contains FOXN1 and a protein transduction domain (PTD) can
translocate from the cell surface into the cytoplasm and nucleus. Intrathymic (i.t.) injection of the rFOXN1
fusion protein into mice increases the number of TECs, and, consequently, enhances thymopoiesis and
increases the number of T cells in the periphery. However, the i.t. injection route is impracticable for human
application. Development of a more practicable regimen in term of the route of administration is necessary.
 The goal of this proposal is to develop new rFOXN1 fusion proteins that can migrate into the thymus to
enhance thymopoiesis after intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.), or subcutaneous (s.c.) injection into old
mice. In the R21 phase, we will produce rFOXN1 fusion proteins containing FOXN1-PTD and thymus targeted
peptides, or thymus/TEC specific receptor or antibody (Aim 1). We will then determine the ability of the
rFOXN1 fusion proteins to migrate into the thymus when injected i.v., i.m. or s.c. (Aim 2), and to increase the
number of TECs and T cells in old mice (Aim 3). If the R21 milestones are met, the R33 phase will be
undertaken. Aim 4 will further characterize the thymus and the peripheral T cell function in the rFOXN1 fusion
protein-treated old mice. In Aim 5, we will determine whether T cells in rFOXN1 fusion protein-treated old mice
are immune tolerant to self-antigens to prevent autoimmunity. Aim 6 will analyze rodent toxicology and
pharmacokinetics of a lead rFOXN1 fusion protein. Our long-term goal is to use the lead rFOXN1 fusion protein
to prevent and treat T cell immunodeficiency in older adults, thus leading to improved healthcare outcomes and
mortality rates."
10819577,"We propose to develop a prognostic mRNA immune signature for resected stage II-III melanoma, in order
to stratify these patients, who have a recurrence risk of ~50%. There is an urgent need to define accurate
prognostic markers for stage II-III melanoma patients because adjuvant immunotherapy to prevent
recurrence is both toxic and expensive. Unfortunately, conventional staging does not allow for accurate
assessment of risk and many “low risk” patients in fact progress. Further, while the immune tumor micro-
environment is a key determinant of outcomes, standard pathologic assessment of tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) is subjective and not applicable to general clinical practice. In order to better stratify
patients for adjuvant immunotherapy, we seek to validate a previously defined 53-gene signature. This
signature employs NanoString, a probe based technology well suited to the analysis of the partially
degraded RNA typically recovered from clinical grade FFPE tissue sections. We initially defined this
signature in a training set and then validated these findings in an independent test set [Sivendran, et al.
(2014) J. Invest. Dermatol. 134:2202-11]. As both training and test sets populations are retrospective, the
next step to develop a clinically applicable assay is to test the signature on prospectively gathered
samples. Given the fact that melanomas can recur years after resection in these early stage patients,
prospective validation would be lengthy, and thus we opted to use the prospective retrospective analysis
[PRA] approach whereby samples are collected and annotated prospectively but analyzed
retrospectively. For this purpose we use samples from the Eastern Cooperative Group (ECOG) E1697
study of adjuvant interferon randomized vs placebo in stage II-III resected melanoma. Patients in this
study have been maintained on study follow-up since they were randomized between 1998 and 2010.
This project is collaboration between the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) at
Columbia University, the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (RPCCC), the University of British
Columbia and Omniseq, a commercial biotech spin-off that is majority owned by RPCCC. In Aim 1 (UH2
phase), we perform the analytical validation of the assay including validation of gene reference controls,
RNA extraction quality, and reporter binding density. The milestone for moving to the UH3 phase (Aim 2)
will be submission to the NYS Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program. In the UH3 clinical validation
phase, we first evaluate two additional retrospective sample populations (from HICCC and RPCCC). As
part of this study we will also correlate the 53-gene signature with state of the art immune indices
including quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence (qmIF) to assess CD8 to CD68 ratio, a metric
recently defined (by our group) to correlate with survival. We then perform the definitive PRA analysis
using the E1697 samples."
10820031,"Abstract. Given the very limited success in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) drug development over the past decades
an extended search for therapy beyond the amyloid-b and tau hypotheses is needed. According to one promising
and underexplored hypothesis, in AD the key pathophysiological events are linked with brain insulin resistance.
This hypothesis, referred to as Type 3 Diabetes (T3D), is supported by many lines of evidence including altered
insulin pathways in AD brains and cognitive benefits of anti-diabetic drugs. The mechanisms of T3D
pathogenesis remain unknown, however. Extensive research demonstrated that suppression of different nodes
in the growth hormone (GH)/ insulin-like growth factor (IGF)/ mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR)
cascade slows down aging and aging-associated cognitive decline in a range of model organisms. Insulin and
IGF hormonal cascades have a common ancestry and the two axes of hormonal signaling are not fully separated.
Their negative feedback loops overlap, so that activation of IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) results in suppression of
insulin receptor substrate (IRS) a key node in insulin signaling. Following this evidence, we hypothesize that
chronic activation of a molecular cascade downstream of IGF1 results in a negative feedback
suppression of insulin signaling (Fig. 1) in the brain and T3D development. Additionally, IGF1R negatively
regulates autophagy and positively regulates NF-kB-mediated inflammation providing bridges between T3D,
misfolded proteins, and inflammatory mechanisms of AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Informed by this
hypothesis, we have conducted preliminary proof of a principle longevity experiments with mice in which small
molecule IGF1R inhibitors orally administered starting 13 months of age (~45 human years) prevented the
decline of short-term memory, prevented the development of insulin resistance, improved grip strength,
decreased frailty, and increased lifespan. Capitalizing on these results the current proposal will allow us to make
further steps toward the development of AD therapy based on IGF1R inhibition via the following aims: (1) to
optimize drug-candidate molecules via computational modeling and subsequent testing of their target affinity
and selectivity, toxicity properties, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics; and (2) to
characterize neurodegeneration prevention by optimized molecules using two mouse models: wildtype
mice naturally developing cognitive decline with age and 3xTg-AD mouse model of AD. The ability of optimized
drugs to improve cognitive function and improve markers of insulin signaling, autophagy, inflammation, Aβ, and
tau pathology in their brains will be analyzed. This project will result in a candidate drug(s) for AD and ADRD,
targeting novel molecular mechanisms and ready for preclinical development."

Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major public health problem within the United States. Alcohol is the third
leading cause of preventable death in the country and nearly 6% of the adult population meets criteria for an
AUD. Unfortunately, due to the complex relationship between genetics and environment which contribute to the
development of AUD, the mechanisms behind its etiology remain unclear. This project aims to elucidate the
role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B) in modulating ethanol behaviors. Previous research has
revealed Gsk3b to be a hub gene in a network highly regulated by ethanol in the mouse medial prefrontal
cortex (mPFC). In response to acute ethanol, GSK3B undergoes inhibitory phosphorylation in both the mPFC
and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Additionally, studies on rodent drinking behavior have demonstrated
pharmacological inhibition of GSK3B decreases ethanol consumption. Gene targeting studies have further
implicated GSK3B in an ethanol-response pathway, showing knock-out decreases ethanol consumption while
overexpression produces an increase. The exact cell type specificity behind this response is yet unknown,
however evidence suggests deletion of GSK3B within CamKIIa+ cells of the entire forebrain is capable of
decreasing drinking behavior. This proposal seeks to increase our knowledge on the critical cell type behind
this response by more specifically targeting CamKIIa+ cells exclusively within the mPFC. Additionally, it is our
hypothesis that GSK3B’s response to ethanol occurs within a circuit between the NAc and PFC to regulate
ethanol behaviors. Finally, we seek to investigate how adaptations of the GSK3B response within this circuit
during the shift from acute ethanol exposure to chronic drinking may be contributing to the development of
progressive ethanol consumption."

This competitive renewal application focuses on continued development of cancer cell-specific nanobubble (NB) ultrasound
contrast agents for real-time guidance of prostate biopsies using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS). In the current clinical
workflow, prostate cancer (PCa) biopsies are almost always performed using TRUS guidance. However due to poor soft
tissue contrast of the B-mode ultrasound scans, the delineation of tumors within the prostate using TRUS is not clear.
Because only 1% of the prostate tissue is sampled with a typical 8-12 core biopsy, a lack of direct guidance of the biopsy to
suspicious lesions has led to high false negative rates and rising morbidity from current standard of care. The development
of a new tool to accurately depict cancer within the prostate in real-time using TRUS is thus urgently needed to aid
in biopsy guidance. To provide a practical tool for clear identification of potential malignancies during prostate biopsies,
we have developed a nanoparticle-based ultrasound contrast agent (called a nanobubble) targeted to the prostate specific
membrane antigen (PSMA) which is significantly over-expressed in most prostate cancers. The PSMA-NBs, are similar in
structure to clinically used microbubbles (MB) and are clearly visible on clinical US. In contrast to MB, which remain in
the vasculature, the small size, deformable shell and gas core, enable NBs extravasate and directly bind to cancer cells. This
results in highly specific accumulation of contrast at the tumor itself leading to better resolution and detection of PCa.
 During our initial award, we developed an entirely new platform NB formulation which has been rigorously vetted
and tested extensively in animal models of PCa. The objective of the next phase of research proposed in this renewal is to
continue working toward clinical translation by performing IND-enabling studies. Here, we will scale up the NB
formulation, test batch-to-batch reproducibility, conduct toxicology studies and engineer viable long-term storage
techniques. Concurrently we will develop multiparametric US imaging biomarkers unique to NBs and acquisition pulse
sequences optimized for use with the NBs to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the PSMA-NB technology;
there are currently no NB specific image acquisition or processing tools for contrast enhanced ultrasound. We will
then test the sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-NB enabled TRUS biopsies in a large animal model of prostate cancer in
dogs, which can accommodate clinical TRUS transducers and a near-identical workflow to clinical standard of care. These
steps are critical to the advancement of the proposed imaging techniques to clinical use. The proposed research feasibility
is supported by strong preliminary data generated by an integrated research team with complementary expertise in NB
formulation and PSMA (Exner, Basilion), bubble-US interactions (Kolios), image processing (Wilson), and clinical prostate
imaging (Bittencourt). The project outcomes will benefit diagnosis, biopsy, and care of prostate cancer using TRUS and
complement the existing clinical workflow."

the remarkable tolerance-inducing results observed with anti-CD154 mAbs. These observations raise the
possibility that blockade of CD154 vs. blockade of CD40 are actually not mechanistically equivalent. As these
anti-CD40 reagents make their way through the pipeline for clinical translation in transplantation, it is
imperative to determine if there is a biological explanation underlying the observed inferiority of blocking CD40
as compared to blocking CD154, in order to then devise ways to overcome it. Here, we present compelling
new preliminary data revealing that CD11b is a second receptor for CD154 during alloimmunity,
signaling through which is blocked by anti-CD154 reagents but not anti-CD40 reagents. Using a specific
peptide antagonist, we find that CD154:CD11b interactions function locally within the allograft to enhance
donor-reactive CD8+ T cell infiltration and accelerate allograft rejection. However, the mechanisms by which
CD154:CD11b interactions promote T cell migration into allografts are unknown. Moreover, induction of Foxp3+
iTreg is a critical effect in anti-CD154-elicted transplantation tolerance, but our new preliminary data show
iTreg are not induced via CD40 blockade or in CD40-/- recipients. Thus, we will also interrogate the role of
blocking novel CD154:CD11b interactions in inducing Foxp3+ iTreg and promoting tolerance during
alloimmunity. Results from the proposed experiments will illuminate novel CD154-dependent aspects of
alloimmunity that are not blocked by anti-CD40 mAbs, thus filling a gap in our understanding of fundamental
mechanisms of allograft rejection. The proposed experiments are also highly clinically relevant, because as
anti-CD40 mAbs move through the pipeline for clinical translation, understanding the impact of CD154:CD11b
interactions (that proceed unimpeded in the setting of CD40 blockade) is of the utmost importance in order to
devise innovative strategies to block these interactions and thus optimize the use of CD40 blockers to facilitate
transplantation tolerance in the clinic."

 Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) arises when Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) crosses the blood-brain
barrier (BBB), and is the most lethal and disabling form of tuberculosis (TB). In some patient populations,
including HIV patients, TBM mortality approaches 50% despite therapy, and long-term disability is very common
amongst survivors due to permanent brain injuries. These injuries are induced in large part by tissue damaging
immune responses and by metabolic disturbance leading to neurotoxic and degenerative neurological damage.
This project is based on our hypothesis that poor clinical outcomes in TBM are due to tissue damaging
inflammation, the lack of adequate therapies that dampen counterproductive host responses, and inadequate
antibiotic penetration into central nervous system (CNS) lesions.
 We propose an integrated program of translational and clinical research to develop and validate tools,
biomarkers and models, which will help predict disease-induced disability, quantify drug penetration at the site
of disease, characterize disease progression, and model response to therapy. The program combines multi-
omic, pharmacokinetic and drug-drug interaction analyses of clinical trial samples, with investigations of
pathogenesis, drug penetration at the site of disease, and testing of novel treatments in a rabbit model of TBM
disease. The clinical -omics signatures will not only generate predictors of death and disability, but also guide
optimization of the rabbit model. The project will draw from two separately funded Phase IIA and Phase III trials
(LASER-TBM and INTENSE-TBM, respectively) in South Africa, evaluating the safety and efficacy of enhanced
antimicrobial and host-directed therapy, including antibiotics approved for TB (high dose rifampicin added to
standard of care) and repurposed drugs (linezolid and aspirin), for adults with TBM. We will use the optimized
rabbit model of TBM to measure the CNS lesion penetration of TB-specific and repurposed antibiotics and of
novel agents. If adequate CNS penetration is demonstrated, the pathogen- and host-directed activity of these
drugs will be further evaluated in the rabbit model. Using these outputs, we will build a translational model
integrating clinical and rabbit site-of-disease PK-PD data to define the contribution of therapeutic interventions
on efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, and to define PK-PD targets for antitubercular therapy in TBM. The results
of these integrated approaches will be forward-translated to propose evidence-based drug regimens with the
potential to improve on death rate and neuro-disability. The principal investigators and their teams combine
basic, translational and clinical research at four institutions with expertise in multi-omics analyses, pharmacology
and immunobiology."

 Women are more susceptible than are men to stress-related mood and anxiety disorders, underscoring the
importance of identifying strategies to promote stress resistance in women. Exercise affords broad benefits to
mental health in both sexes, but whether the degree of stress protection and underlying mechanisms differ
between sexes is unknown. We recently discovered that female rats are more responsive to the stress-buffering
effects of exercise than males. It takes voluntary wheel running (WVR) half the time to enable protection against
the depression- and anxiety-like effects of inescapable stress (IS) in female rats (3 wk) than it does in males (6
wk). Enhanced stress protection from exercise in females is an entirely unexplored resilience phenomenon. The
goal of this proposal is to examine the sex- and circuit-specific determinants of this process across multiple units
of analysis (molecular, cellular, circuits, sex, and behavior). VWR prevents the behavioral sequelae of IS by
constraining activation of serotoninergic (5HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during IS, but the
mechanism by which exercise constrains DRN 5HT activity is unknown. Our preliminary data provide strong
evidence that stress resistance in both sexes arises from engagement of sensorimotor circuits (dorsolateral
striatum; DLS) responsible for maintaining exercise. We have found that the DLS is positioned to inhibit DRN
5HT neurons through a direct GABAergic projection (DLS-DRN circuit), and 6 wk of VWR potentiates the activity
of the DLS-DRN circuit during IS. Importantly, although the DLS is required to maintain VWR behavior in both
sexes, the DLS governs VWR earlier in females (4 d) than in males (4 wk). Dopamine (DA) in the DLS contributes
to DLS-dependent behavior and females are known to have heightened stimulus-evoked dopamine (DA)
responses compared to males. This is likely the case with VWR, as just a few bouts of VWR activates D1
receptor-expressing neurons in the DLS of females, but not males. The rapid recruitment of the DLS during VWR
in females could accelerate plasticity in the DLS-DRN circuit required for constraining stress-induced 5HT
activity. Indeed, stress resistance from 3 wk of VWR in females depends on activity of the DLS-DRN circuit
during IS. These data suggest that once exercise becomes governed by the DLS, the DLS-DRN circuit now
responds actively to future adversity, thereby inhibiting the DRN & enabling stress resistance. We hypothesize
that DLS neural ensembles link exercise to stress resistance and are particularly responsive to exercise in
females, due to heightened DA responses to exercise in females compared to males. Intersectional genetic
approaches that tag, record, and manipulate neural circuit activity during initial exercise and later stress will be
used to 1) identify the role of the DLS in the development of exercise-induced stress resistance and accelerated
stress resistance in females, 2) determine the role of the DLS in the expression of exercise-induced stress
resistance in both sexes, and 3) identify the role of DA in driving accelerated stress resistance from VWR in
females and in determining whether an appetitive, sensorimotor experience enables stress resistance."

 Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration and related low back pain (LBP) affect up to 85% of the U.S.
population over their lifetime, resulting in annual healthcare costs that exceed $100 billion. The IVD is largely
avascular and consists of a central proteoglycan (PG)-rich nucleus pulposus (NP), and a surrounding collagen-
rich annulus fibrosus (AF), as well as superiorly and inferiorly located endplates. The IVD relies on diffusion of
nutrients and waste through the cartilaginous endplate (CEP) to maintain its health. IVD degeneration is
characterized by loss of PGs, dehydration of the NP, collagen loss within the AF, and degradation of the CEP.
Dehydration and calcification of the CEP reduce its diffusivity, leading to a reduction in oxygen and glucose
transport to the remainder of the disc. Changes in the CEP may occur at the same time or even precede disc
degeneration. Evaluation of this complex situation requires a comprehensive, non-invasive imaging technique
that can assess PG in the NP, collagen in the AF, and diffusivity of the CEP. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is routinely used in the diagnosis of IVD degeneration. However, conventional MRI techniques do not
provide reliable assessment of disc biochemical content nor of CEP function. This study aims to further
develop a 3D ultrashort echo time (UTE) adiabatic T1r (UTE-AdiabT1r) sequence for robust mapping of PGs, a
UTE magnetization transfer (UTE-MT) sequence for mapping of macromolecular fraction (MMF), an adiabatic
inversion recovery UTE with fat saturation (IR-FS-UTE) sequence for T2* mapping of the CEP to evaluate
calcification and dehydration, and a UTE dual echo steady state (UTE-DESS) sequence to study its apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC). In Aim 1 we will develop 3D UTE sequences to evaluate IVD in lumbar spines from
young (<40y, n=10), mid-age (40-70y, n=10), and elderly (>70y, n=10) donors, and correlate UTE (AdiabT1r,
MMF, T2*, ADC) and clinical MRI measures with reference including CT, µCT, histology, biochemistry, and
diffusion test of three groups of spine samples. In Aim 2 we will evaluate 3D UTE sequences to assess IVD
degeneration and regeneration using a mature rabbit annular puncture chronic disc degeneration model. We
will study IVD degeneration in four groups of rabbits (n=16 per group) at 4, 8, 16, and 28 weeks post-AF
puncture, as well as IVD regeneration using six groups of rabbits (n=16 per group) at 4, 12 and 24 weeks post-
injection of saline and growth differentiation factor-6 (GDF-6). We will correlate UTE and clinical MRI findings
with reference including µCT, histology, biochemistry, and diffusion test of ten groups of rabbit lumbar spines.
In Aim 3 we will translate UTE sequences to study IVD degeneration in patients with chronic LBP (n=40) and
normal IVDs in healthy volunteers (n=40), compare UTE and clinical MRI metrics of the NP, AF, and CEP of
the lumbar spine in the two groups, and correlate them with clinical evaluations. Our central hypothesis is
that UTE sequences can detect changes in PG and collagen in the disc as well as changes in diffusivity of the
CEP, allowing more comprehensive and accurate evaluation of disc degeneration than is now possible."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss, yet the molecular events that initiate
the early retinal defects that lead to visual dysfunction remain poorly understood. The objective here is to
examine a role for the stress response protein regulated in development and DNA damage 1 (REDD1) in the
impaired adaptive response of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) with aging and consequently development of
AMD. Proof-of-concept studies support a potential role for REDD1 in AMD pathophysiology. In fact, intravitreal
administration of a siRNA targeting the REDD1 mRNA has demonstrated promise for improving visual function
in patients with AMD. However, we recently discovered that the REDD1 protein acts as a molecular redox sensor.
Specifically, a reversible redox-sensitive disulfide bond prevents degradation of REDD1 by lysosomal
proteolysis. Consequently, retinal REDD1 inhibition by siRNA-mediated knockdown may only be partially
effective for reducing REDD1 protein expression in retinal disease. The central hypothesis is that activation of
the REDD1 redox-sensor in RPE promotes oxidative stress, inflammation, and retinal pathology in AMD. To test
the hypothesis, we will employ a preclinical murine model of non-neovascular AMD, transgenic REDD1 mouse
lines, and human iPSC-derived RPE in three specific aims. Aim 1 will examine a role for REDD1 as a dominant
governor of the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) antioxidant response in RPE. We predict that
REDD1 prevents a proper antioxidant response in AMD by promoting Nrf2 nuclear exclusion. Aim 2 will
investigate a role for REDD1 in RPE inflammation and trans-differentiation via activation of the transcription
factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). The proposed studies will explore NF-κB signaling in AMD models and
evaluate the expression of NF-κB target genes, including pro-inflammatory cytokines and epithelial-to-
mesenchymal (EMT) transcription factors. Aim 3 will utilize REDD1 knockout mice and a newly developed
REDD1 point mutation knockin mouse that expresses a REDD1 variant that is continuously degraded by
lysosomal proteolysis to evaluate the formation of hyper-reflective foci, RPE damage, photoreceptor thinning,
and impaired visual function in non-neovascular AMD. It is well established that oxidative stress and inflammation
are crucial factors in the development and progression of the complications that cause visual impairment. The
studies herein are significant because they are designed to identify and characterize specific molecular events
that contribute to oxidative stress and inflammation in AMD by addressing key knowledge gaps related to a
cutting-edge therapeutic target. To do so, we will explore the concept that activation of the REDD1 redox sensor
is a unifying molecular mechanism for improper activation of Nrf2 and NF-κB in AMD."
10797549,"Anemia, characterized by low blood hemoglobin (Hgb) levels, is the world’s most common blood
disorder, afflicting 1.6 billion people, with 80 million at high risk in the US alone. Due to numerous etiologies,
anemia can also be chronic and potentially life-threatening. Given the severity and epidemiological impact of
anemia, screening is crucial for those at risk for anemia, and those with diagnosed chronic anemia require
frequent monitoring. Currently, the gold-standard diagnostic test for anemia is the complete blood count (CBC),
which requires a patient visit to a clinic/hospital or commercial lab as well as trained phlebotomists/technicians.
However, access to this test is cost-prohibitive and inconvenient. Due to the inconvenience, and cost associated
with CBCs, point-of-care (POC) Hgb diagnostics have been developed, but current systems all suffer from high-
cost (handheld Hgb meters cost USD $30-$1000), or inaccuracy, and no non-invasive, inexpensive, easily
accessible over the counter (OTC) anemia diagnostic exists that accurately measures a patient’s Hgb levels,
especially as a patient self-test. To address these critical challenges, Sanguina, Inc has developed a novel,
multi-faceted anemia screening and monitoring suite of products comprising 3 key products 1) AnemoCheck
Home (under FDA interactive review) – a “single drop of blood” fingerstick test that utilizes our clinical FDA-
cleared technology to elicit a color change that correlates to Hgb levels, 2) The AnemoCheck app - a
smartphone app that screens for anemia using only smartphone photos and the phone’s native hardware and
3) AnemoCheck MyMobile, a marriage of the Home and app products in which the app is calibrated with the
AnemoCheck Home to significantly improve the apps accuracy and personalize Hgb level results. These
technologies have been published in high-impact, peer-reviewed journals (Tyburski et at., JCI 2014, Mannino et
al, Nature Communications 2018). Sanguina has leveraged the ubiquity of smartphones and the familiarity of
fingerpick-based self-testing to develop a paradigm-shifting platform for managing chronic anemia at home.
 The goal of this Phase IIB SBIR is to complete additional studies requested by FDA for human
factors validation and head-to-head clinical performance in actual home settings of AnemoCheck
MyMobile with AnemoCheck Home for training the algorithm. We will leverage our collaborations with co-I,
Dr. Wilbur Lam and existing relationships with the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, Cooley’s Anemia
Foundation and eMed to conduct our expanded multi-site clinical validation on a diverse cohort of adult and
pediatric patients with chronic anemia. Results will be compared against AnemoCheck MyMobile when
trained by a traditional blood test and traditional blood testing in order submit to FDA for clearance of
AnemoCheck MyMobile as the first non-invasive smartphone app technology for anemia management
in those with chronic anemia."

In the United States, 67% of 4th graders are reading below proficiency, and this trend persists into adolescence
(8th grade). As such, the identification and remediation of reading-related difficulties remains critical. Although
many cases of poor reading comprehension result from poor decoding, or the ability to translate written words
into their spoken form, a substantial number of children struggle with comprehending text despite having
adequate decoding (i.e., specific reading comprehension deficit [SRCD]). SRCD affects 3-15% of children in the
general population, a prevalence rate that is similar to and/or exceeds other specific learning disabilities,
including dyslexia (3-15%) and dyscalculia (3-6%), which suggests that SRCD impacts a substantial number of
children and their families. Decades of research have investigated the origins, prevalence, and prognosis of
reading difficulties, but most have focused on the identification and remediation of poor decoding; comparatively
fewer studies have prioritized children with SRCD. Although increasingly more work is being done in this area,
several significant challenges are uniquely associated with SRCD, which continue to have downstream
implications for its identification and remediation and thus requires further study. First, children with SRCD have
average decoding and minimal phonological processing deficits. This is notable because deficits in these areas
are often cited as early indicators of later reading difficulties, and yet, they provide minimal information about
SRCD risk. Second, reading comprehension develops later than other reading-related skills, such as decoding.
This is a concern because not all reading difficulties are evident early, which suggests that SRCD has the
potential to persist well into adolescence, a period during which reading difficulties are notoriously difficult to
remediate. Third, how poor reading comprehension is often defined—reading comprehension lower than
(developmentally) expected—implies that weak reading comprehension relative to decoding occurs exclusively
at the low tail of the distribution. Although this approach ensures that we capture only those children who are
struggling with reading comprehension it ignores the fact that children with poor reading comprehension relative
to decoding exist along the entire distribution and may lead us to miss those whose poor reading comprehension
is unexpected. In the proposed project, I will address these limitations by moving away from the standard
discrepancy definition of SRCD to a more inclusive one and extending a novel approach that has been developed
and refined in simulation but has yet to be applied empirically. More specifically, the proposal aims to (1)
investigate the nature of specific reading comprehension deficit in large representative samples of childhood and
adolescent readers and (2) identify domain-specific, domain-general, and social skills-related correlates of
specific reading comprehension deficit. In this way, findings garnered from the proposed project can further
inform policy and practice aimed at supporting children whose ability to read text far outpaces their ability to
understand it."

The long-term goals of this research are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying noise-induced
hearing loss (NIHL) and to propose rational therapeutic interventions for prevention. Based on our previous
findings and consistent with findings in other systems, we will test the hypothesis that prolonged activation of
AMPKα (T172) by calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2) and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) or
reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggers outer hair cell (OHC) death. We further propose that activated CaMKK2
facilitates translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) into OHC nuclei, causing release of cytokine
genes. Finally, we will use siRNA and pharmacological compounds to block multiple death pathways for potential
synergistic protection against NIHL. We will employ a comprehensive experimental approach including in-vivo
studies with adult mice to define the underlying molecular mechanisms using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) via
virus transfection, single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and
fluorescence in-situ hybridization with RNAscope. These studies investigating innovative therapeutic strategies
are designed to identify novel avenues for the prevention of NIHL, benefiting the quality of life of affected
individuals and reducing healthcare costs. In addition, the data generated by this proposal will make a significant
contribution to our understanding of a broad range of inner ear disorders since similarities have been shown in
the molecular events associated with noise-induced, drug-induced, and age-related hearing loss."

There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new long-acting formulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) delivered by injection has been developed. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has a long history of clinical use in a variety of contraceptives (pills, intrauterine devices, and implants) and its efficacy and safety are well recognized.
The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP) or so-called “mini pill,” which is used mainly by lactating women only for several months and requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. A long-acting injectable form of LB that is estrogen-free will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a POP and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE especially for obese women. In order to provide preliminary evidence that LB could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The proposed study will be conducted in women of reproductive age in order to evaluate pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, and safety of this new contraceptive. The enrolled subjects will receive a single injection of LB. Drug administration via intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of injection will be evaluated. The Recruitment will include enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI >=32 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2.
II.SCOPE
To measure hormones and other biological assays as defined by the protocol, serving as the central laboratory to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic effects, cycle control, and safety of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) formulated as a long-acting injectable.
III.OBJECTIVES
To obtain valid and reliable assay data to determine the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic effects, cycle control, and safety of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) formulated as a long-acting injectable and to relate the data from the current study to the previous study of LB conducted on the original formulation"

Bacteria employ several distinct defense strategies for protection from phage infection.
CRISPR-Cas is one such mechanism that provides an adaptive immune protection against
recurring phage infections based on genetic memory retained from past infections. The genetic
memory is retained through a process called “adaptation” where short pieces of the intruder
DNA (called prespacers) are selected following certain rules, and site-specifically inserted into
the CRISPR locus as a “spacer”. The spacer is transcribed into guide-RNAs that are essential
for sequence-specific targeting and inactivation of foreign genetic material. Adaptation in type II-
A CRISPR systems is unique compared to other CRISPR systems due to the inherent
capabilities of Cas1 and Cas2 proteins to catalyze the site-specific prespacer insertion without
assistance from cellular factors to maintain fidelity during insertion. This property offers unique
promises for type II-A Cas1-Cas2-based biotechnological and biomedical applications. Previous
work from the PI’s group has identified distinct subgroups of type II-A CRISPR systems based
on conserved DNA motifs present at the site of insertion, which is conserved across many
bacterial genera. Accompanying work had biochemically established unique differences in the
mechanisms of prespacer insertion by the different subgroups. The proposed research aims to
derive molecular mechanisms of the differences in DNA requirements and efficiencies of
prespacer insertion between the different type II-A subgroups. To derive structural and
conformational differences between these subgroups, hydrogen deuterium exchange mass
spectrometry (HDX-MS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be performed, followed
by biochemical validation of the results from HDX-MS and MD simulations. To assess the
contribution of individual protein and nucleic acid complexes in site-specific DNA insertion,
QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) calculations will be employed. Based on
the free energy contributions identified, amino acids and DNA nucleotides will be mutated to
change integration efficiency with the end goal of engineering new Cas1-Cas2 variants which
has developed specificity to a newly designed DNA sequence. Since Cas1 and Cas2 based
prespacer insertion is vital to the functioning of all CRISPR systems, the lessons learned can be
translated to other CRISPR systems. Applications include programmed DNA insertions,
enhancing phage therapy to fight drug-resistant bacteria, and to develop bacteria that can fight
off phage infections for the fermentation industry."

 White adipose tissue (WAT) is a key regulator of whole-body energy balance. During
feeding WAT enters an anabolic state facilitated by insulin by storing non-esterified fatty acids
(NEFA) in triglycerides (TG). During fasting WAT enters a catabolic state facilitated by
catecholamines and releases NEFA from TG. During pathogenic insulin resistance, excessive
NEFA accumulates in blood (lipotoxicity) and stimulates excessive hepatic glucose production.
There is a growing awareness that many of the defects in metabolism seen in obese and
prediabetic patients occur not under fasted conditions, but in the postprandial state of one to
four hours following a meal. Indeed, elevated postprandial NEFA partitioning to non-adipose
tissues clearly occurs in these patients and is strongly implicated in the induction of peripheral
insulin resistance. Our novel preliminary data shows that food intake causes a switch from A1R
to another adenosine receptor, Gs-coupled A2B receptor (A2BR), resulting in increased A2BR
and decreased A1R expression and function. The changes in adenosine receptor expression from
A1 to A2B reverse adenosine action. This switch in adenosine signaling reveals that adenosine
functions as a feedback metabolite to oppose dominant hormonal signals: opposing
catecholamines during fasting via A1R inhibition of lipolysis, and opposing insulin in response
to feeding via A2BR stimulation of lipolysis. Obesity shifts the adenosine receptor balance
toward A2BR expression characteristic of feeding and this shift provides an explanation for the
known obesity-induced impairment in postprandial NEFA storage. This proposal undertakes a
rigorous and comprehensive examination of how A2B adenosine receptor (A2BR) signaling
changes between fasted and postprandial conditions and the functional consequences of genetic
deletion or pharmacological manipulation of A2BR signaling. We will also determine how food
intake promotes adenosine signaling via A2BR in fat during the postprandial period."

Predicting the consequences of action is a vital function of the nervous system. The hypothesized neural
substrate are so-called internal models that transform information about outgoing motor commands and the
current sensory state into predictions of sensory input. Such internal models are likely critical for a wide range
of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions and their disruption has been implicated in neurological disorders
such as autism and schizophrenia. Nevertheless, it has proven challenging to understand how internal models
are implemented in neural circuits in the mammalian brain. Our prior studies were successful in developing a
detailed mechanistic understanding of how neurons in the electrosensory lobe (ELL) of mormyrid fish predict
and cancel out the sensory consequences of a simple behavior--the electric organ discharge (EOD) pulse.
However, because these studies were performed in immobilized animals, the nature of the predictions studied
was limited in scope and complexity. This renewal uses novel methods for neural recording and high-resolution
behavior monitoring in freely swimming fish to study the more complex internal models underlying the
remarkable active electrolocation abilities of electric fish. Computational modeling approaches will be used
both to rigorously define the problem facing the active electrosensory system and to generate and test realistic
circuit-level models of how they may be solved. The key components of such models, including synaptic
plasticity, recurrent and feedforward connectivity, and biophysical compartmentalization of axonal and dendritic
spikes, are common to many neural systems including the cerebellum, hippocampus, and neocortex. Hence
insights from these studies are expected to be widely relevant to understanding how internal models are
implemented in neural systems."

Among the 51.5 million US adults with mental illness (MI), over 18 million smoke cigarettes, 7-9,50-52 leading to
high morbidity60-62 and dramatic early mortality.12-14 Smokers with MI are less likely to quit and/or sustain
abstinence than smokers without MI,17-21 due in part to lower self-efficacy65 and more use of smoking to cope
with stress.67-69 Lower levels of readiness to pursue smoking cessation treatments,64,66 most of which require a
desire for complete abstinence, leaves most smokers with MI continuing to smoke, creating an urgent need to
develop new ways to decrease the harms from cigarettes. Tobacco harm reduction is not clearly defined, but it
involves a value-neutral view of smoking, focused on decreasing the harms from tobacco use, neither objecting
to nor insisting on abstinence as the only goal.71 E-cigarettes (e-cigs) deliver much lower levels of carcinogens
than cigarettes;72,73 thus, support for replacement of most or all cigarettes with e-cigs (“switching”) may be an
effective harm reduction strategy for smokers with MI. Three pilot studies found that providing e-cigs to
smokers with MI significantly reduced use of cigarettes (up to 65%),34-36 and 10-14.3% of smokers replaced
their cigarettes with e-cigs.34,35 In the only RCT comparing e-cig provision to smoking-as-usual in smokers with
MI (R01DA041416), we found that 18.6% of the e-cig group switched to e-cigs, 46% reduced to ≤5 cigs/day,
and NNAL, a potent carcinogen, was significantly reduced.3 But, many smokers did not achieve harm reduction
with e-cig provision alone. Feedback from participants indicated that a key barrier to giving up cigarettes was
the habitual use of cigarettes when under stress. This study responds to PAR-22-182’s call for “research
on tobacco harm reduction strategies such as switching from combustibles to e-cigarettes.”
We developed and piloted “SWITCH IT,” consisting of behavioral support to boost e-cig use and manage
stress, for smokers with MI who are not ready to quit. SWITCH IT was delivered to 50 smokers with MI via 10
video calls. Attendance was 90.3%, indicating high appeal of behavioral support. Twice as many smokers
(38% vs. 19%) switched to e-cigs (confirmed by breath CO<10 ppm) compared to the e-cig group in our RCT.
We now propose to test the effect of SWITCH IT on “switching” using several measures of harm reduction (≤5
cigs/day and CO<10; 0 cigs/day and CO<6, and NNAL). We will also explore potential barriers to switching
(cravings, positive and negative affect, e-cig satisfaction) and possible mechanisms of behavioral change from
SWITCH IT (coping with stress without smoking, and self-efficacy). Finally, we will explore the role of e-cigs in
switching by comparing trajectories of change in cigarette and e-cig use over time. We will assign 250 smokers
with MI in 2 US states to receive SWITCH IT and an 8-week supply of e-cigs or e-cigs only. Participants will be
assessed at BL, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 26 weeks. This project would break new ground and advance the field
of tobacco harm reduction by empirically exploring definitions of harm reduction and “switching,” and testing
the efficacy of using behavioral support for e-cig use to augment harm reduction in smokers with MI."

The Consortium for Technology & Innovation in Pediatrics (CTIP 3.0) is a pediatric medical device consortium
based at Lurie Children’s Hospital (LCH) and Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) established in 2011 and
funded by the FDA in 2013 and 2018. CTIP facilitates the development and commercialization of pediatric
medical devices by simultaneously engaging and coordinating clinicians, engineers, regulators, hospital
administrators, industry, patients, and the business community to guide and support medical device
development for children. For portfolio companies, CTIP fosters networking opportunities, clinical partnerships,
research and evidence generation, and direct and indirect financial support and expert guidance on issues
related, but not limited to, intellectual property, prototyping, engineering, testing, grant writing, business
development, regulatory strategy, and clinical trial design. CTIP has established a network of children’s
hospitals, academic institutions, accelerators, incubators, and ecosystem partners to support the
commercialization of pediatric medical devices. Over the past ten years, CTIP has expanded from southern
California, to the entire west coast, and now to a national consortium with academic and industry partners in
California, Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Colorado, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin. CTIP’s overarching
goals are: 1) Accelerate pediatric MedTech forward, no matter how small or large the step, through non-dilutive
funding and comprehensive wrap-around services at every stage of the total product life cycle; 2) Connect
pediatric medical device innovators to our national network of experts and multidisciplinary stakeholders to
foster research, clinical, and business partnerships; and 3) Advocate for pediatric health equity and champion
pediatric-specific innovation through research, publications, public events, education, and collaborations. The
systematic barriers to pediatric device innovation are too complex for any one entity to address, so we have
worked tirelessly to be effective partners to the other PDCs, the FDA, healthcare organizations, investors, and
other ecosystem partners. By coordinating with larger organizations, we multiply our efforts and reach in the
field of pediatric medical devices. For the next funding cycle, CTIP plans to continue to deliver excellent
support to all of our portfolio members, and expand our activities in four key areas: 1) business development
and follow-on funding opportunities to ensure our companies have the financial runway they need to bring their
devices to market; 2) growing our robust pediatric medical device clinical trials infrastructure and services; 3)
engaging patients and families intentionally as partners in device development and advocacy; and 4)
addressing founders’ critical knowledge gaps in healthcare informatics, including data integration,
interoperability, cybersecurity, and EHR workflows. These new activities will help CTIP continue to build a
sustainable, needs-driven pipeline of new pediatric medical devices, with the ultimate goal of having more and
better devices available on the market that are designed to specifically meet the health needs of children."
10818661,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer. However,
the initial success of ACT has been limited to chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies for hematological
malignancies. Applying this cell therapy to solid tumors is challenged by the lack of targetable tumor antigens,
the severe systemic toxicity and the suppressive tumor microenvironment. T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy
can overcome some of these challenges because it enables targeting of intracellular proteins presented as
peptide antigens on the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. However, the majority of naturally occurring
TCRs are of low-affinity to their peptide-HLA targets. Engineering these TCRs via phage display or yeast display
for higher affinity is complicated by the introduction of unwanted cross-reactivity and the poor association
between affinity and function. This project seeks to tackle each of the major challenges of ACT in order to
effectively reprogram the immune system to combat solid tumors.
 The F99 phase is focused on a TCR engineering platform for the creation, modification, and profiling of
TCRs that can target tumor-associated self-proteins with minimal toxicity profiles. In this approach, I first raise T
cells from the natural repertoire that recognize a related ‘foreign’ peptide that differs by one amino acid from the
self-peptide. Then, I modulate the fine specificity of the TCR by directed evolution of the peptide binding region
to switch its specificity towards the tumor self-antigen of interest. I demonstrate the value of this approach by the
creation of libraries of viral-specific TCRs and the subsequent in vitro selection of TCRs that switched specificity
to a closely related epitope. The engineered TCRs showed robust T-cell activation after ligand recognition and
are of equal or higher efficiency than the parental receptor. Importantly, the engineered TCRs displayed no
additional promiscuity or off-target specificities as compared to the parental TCRs. The goal for the remainder of
my dissertation project is to apply this approach to the generation of cancer reactive TCRs. By controlling the
fine specificity of TCRs, this approach will overcome two of the major challenges of ACT, namely increasing the
breadth of antigens that can be used for ACT while also minimizing cross-reactivities.
 For the K00 phase, I will shift my focus to addressing the suppressive tumor microenvironment that
surrounds solid tumors by developing novel synthetic receptors and testing them in mouse models. I plan to build
upon my synthetic biology background to implement novel high-throughput screens, learn new statistical analysis
methods, and gain experience working with in vivo mouse models of cancer. These new approaches, coupled
with my already strong background in genetics, molecular biology and biochemistry will allow me to address the
most pressing and challenging issues facing targeted immunotherapies. With the aid of this award, I intend to
continue my research contribution to become a leader in the field of cancer immunotherapy."
10924016,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) which mirrors the parental tumor, is present in the plasma of non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC) patients. Liquid biopsy analysis of ctDNA allows early detection and genetic monitoring.
However, current PCR-based liquid biopsy methods often have difficulty detecting ctDNA due to low copies in
circulation. In contrast, the electric field-induced release and measurement liquid biopsy (eLB) platform, detects
mutant EGFR (L858R, exon19del, T790M) ctDNA with a >90% tissue-genotype concordance in <50ul of
unprocessed plasma of NSCLC patients. Preliminary data demonstrate that the ctDNA detected by eLB may be
ultrashort single-stranded ctDNA (usssctDNA) which contrasts the typically described 160-basepair
internucleosomal double-stranded ctDNA. This new subpopulation is undetectable through PCR-based liquid
biopsy methods due to size-selection bias. The goal of the F99 Phase is to use usssctDNA-seq, a novel NGS
pipeline, to explore if NSCLC plasma contains high quantities of ctDNA that are ultrashort and single-stranded.
This pipeline consists of a usssctDNA-specific extraction, library preparation, deep sequencing, and bioinformatic
analysis. To verify, 80 late-stage NSCLC EGFR-mutated plasma samples will undergo usssctDNA-seq. The
discovery of usssctDNA will open up a wealth of previously unnoticed information leading to improved treatment
and survival of NSCLC patients. Afterward, during the K00 Phase, the trainee hopes to explore the biological
origins of biofluid ctDNA and the incorporation of usssctDNA into modern multi-analyte approaches for pan-
cancer detection. This will involve training in new skills such as organoid modeling, methylation and leukocyte
sequencing, and bioinformatic machine learning at a world-leading cancer-oriented institute. Ultimately, the goal
of this proposed F99/K00 project will to prepare the trainee for a career in cancer research with an expertise in
liquid biopsy and cell-free DNA biology."
10918256,"Project Summary
On October 1st, 2015, the FDA granted accelerated approval for the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1
monoclonal antibodies showing 1-year survival of 94% and 2-year survival of 88% in patients with metastatic
melanoma. These treatments, collectively referred to as immune checkpoint blockade therapies (ICBs),
comprise a successful class of systemic immunotherapies. Nevertheless, a major subset of patients still do not
respond in the long-term to current ICBs and this failure is likely due to the inability of ICBs to generate potent
cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against cancer antigens as well as the tolerizing effects of so-called
“cold” tumors. Thus, in order to turn non-responsive cold tumors into treatable “hot” tumors, there are countless
preclinical investigations exploring other immune pathways that can be pharmacologically modulated as
combination immunotherapy strategies. This has resulted in more than 1800 ongoing clinical trials in the US
alone looking to combine ICBs with synthetic immunomodulators (IMs) in order to improve long-term survival in
cancer patients. A major unmet need with these IMs is the ability to administer multiple therapeutic doses
systemically in a safe manner to effectively treat the disease in a metastatic setting.
Drug delivery systems and rational dosing schedules have the potential to reduce the toxicity of such
compounds that activate the immune system, and they could enable treatment of tumors that do not respond to
ICBs via kinetically controlled, targeted and precisely timed delivery of immunomodulating drugs.
In the F99-phase of the proposed research, Sachin Bhagchandani will leverage the control of bottlebrush
polymers (BBPs) to improve cancer immunotherapy through increasing the therapeutic index of IMs by
enabling precise control over the release of these compounds and targeting them to the necessary immune
cell subsets in the tumor microenvironment.
In the K00-phase of the proposed research, Sachin will focus on understanding immune tolerance post initial
dosing of IMs in order to design appropriate dosing schemes to circumvent tolerance since these
immunotherapy treatments will require repeat dosing in order to drive an antitumor immune response.
The preliminary data generated with BBPs provides a strong basis to systemically deliver these IMs by tuning
drug-linker chemistry and aspect ratio (F99 phase) and defining tolerance mechanisms and dosing schedules
to obtain parameters that are effective in genetically engineered mouse models which are currently refractive
to ICBs (K00 phase)."
10785359,"Abstract
There have been dramatic and concerning increases in rates of psychological distress in students enrolled in
U.S. colleges and universities over the last decade. The majority of college students in the last year experienced
mental health problems, and if left untreated, symptoms of these problems have serious individual and public
health consequences, both in the short- and long-term. However, the vast majority of students do not receive
professional mental health support because traditional treatments are perceived as ineffective and
inconvenient, and because on-campus resources cannot meet the demand of students needing support. As a
result, it is critical to identify acceptable and effective interventions to address what is being called a “campus
mental health crisis”. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are very well-liked by college students, most of
whom are late adolescents; in addition, they are effective at increasing mindfulness and emotion regulation as
well as reducing stress and depression. However, MBI effects have typically been small-to-moderate. Outside of
the mindfulness literature, technological supplements to group-based programs like MBIs have been found to
be effective at increasing intervention efficacy. Our team developed the first multi-modal adaptive supplement
to an MBI (5K01AT009592), Learning to BREATHE PLUS (L2B PLUS), which supplements an evidence-based
group MBI with multiple methods of support for practicing mindfulness in daily life. Our program of research
provides evidence at a single-site that L2B PLUS is feasible and highly acceptable to adolescents, results in
sustained levels of engagement across the group program period, and appears to be more effective than the
standard, Learning to BREATHE group program (L2B) for increasing daily mindfulness practice and
consistency of mindfulness during stress as well as reducing psychological distress; in turn, L2B appears more
effective in reducing stress-related behavior compared to an active, didactic health education control
(HealthEd). Building directly on our prior work, the proposed R01 study is a multi-site, pilot randomized
controlled trial implemented at four sites in order to prepare for a future multi-site efficacy trial testing the
effects of L2B PLUS relative to the standard L2B program and HealthEd on depression, anxiety, and stress.
Specific aims of the current proposal are to: 1) evaluate multi-site fidelity of training and implementation of 6-
week L2B PLUS, 6-week L2B, and 6-week HealthEd to college students experiencing stress, 2) test multi-site
feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, retention, and protocol adherence for a randomized controlled trial
(RCT) involving L2B PLUS, L2B, and HealthEd, and 3) modify training/implementation and protocol for a
future, fully powered multi-site efficacy trial. Completion of these aims will prepare us for an adequately-
powered, multi-site efficacy trial, and ultimately inform a complementary and integrative approach to
supporting college students experiencing problems with stress."

This is a biphasic project to develop and implement a novel high throughput screening (HTS) system for
identification of inhibitors of hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) (R21 phase),
followed by preclinical drug development studies (R33 phase). HBV cccDNA is essential to the virus life cycle,
its elimination is considered critical to a cure but has not been achieved by the FDA-approved drugs that
exclusively target the viral polymerase. Due to the limitations of current HBV experimental systems, including
the impracticality of detecting cccDNA itself, cccDNA has not been rigorously targeted in HTS of small molecule
libraries. In the R21 phase of this proposal, a novel cell line expressing a split luciferase tag HiBiT-labeled HBV
precore (pC) in a cccDNA-dependent manner will be used to establish an HTS assay for screening of cccDNA
inhibitors. This cell line inducibly produces viral pregenomic RNA from a stably integrated HBV genome
(transgene) with the HiBiT sequence inserted in the pC region, leading to viral DNA replication and cccDNA
formation; subsequently, HiBiT-tagged-pC mRNA is only transcribed from the cccDNA template, then the
translated HiBiT-pC protein is detected by split luciferase reconstitution assay. In such system, compounds that
lower the HiBiT-pC would be considered candidate inhibitors of cccDNA formation, expression or longevity. We
will first miniaturize the cell-based assay to the 384-well format, the performance characteristics and the
robustness of the assay under HTS conditions will be determined. Next, an HTS screen will be conducted against
a library containing 20,000 “cherry-picked” compounds, the first round hits will be filtered through dose-ranging
activity and cytotoxicity analyses, and through counter-screening in a cell line constitutively expressing transgene
(not cccDNA)-dependent HiBiT-pC to remove the off-target hits. Finally, the HTS-derived hits will be validated in
multiple cccDNA-producing cell models by directly measuring the levels of cccDNA and its transcripts. The
confirmed hits and their analogs will be repurchased and retested for their activity against cccDNA to obtain the
final hits. In the R33 phase, hit-to-lead optimization will be conducted through structure activity relationship (SAR)
study, and lead compounds will be prioritized according to activity, cytotoxicity, chemical tractability, in vitro
pharmacology, mechanism of action (MoA), and synergistic effect and off-treatment effect in combination with
tenofovir (TDF). Up to ten compounds will be advanced for in vivo pharmacology assessment, and the best
candidate(s), ideally one cccDNA destabilizer and one cccDNA silencer, will progress to in vivo antiviral efficacy
test in HBV-infected humanized mouse model. Successful completion of our goals will deliver at least one lead
compound to advanced preclinical studies toward development of novel therapy to cure chronic hepatitis B."
10785394,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Rationale: Continued evolution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to immune-evasive variants that pose a persistent threat to global public
health. Updated vaccines are needed to provide improved immune responses against emerging variants, but
current approaches targeting the Omicron BA.4/5 variant may have limited effectiveness due to immune
imprinting caused by prior immune system exposure to ancestral D614G variant antigens. Our preliminary data
suggests that bivalent boosters targeting BA.4/5 do not provide superior neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses
to SARS-CoV-2 variants compared to the original monovalent vaccine. This mentored career project aims to
elucidate the impact and molecular basis of immune imprinting following primary D614G vaccination on
subsequent humoral responses to variant antigens. Candidate: As an Infectious Diseases physician with a PhD
in Microbiology and Immunology, I am uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between biomedical research and
patient care to advance our knowledge of humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. Further training in
virology, structural biology, bioinformatics, and monoclonal antibody characterization will be crucial for
completion of the proposed research and my development as an independent physician-scientist specializing in
humoral immunity to pathogens of global importance. I have a globally recognized mentor in Dr. David Ho and
benefit from an outstanding multidisciplinary team of experts to guide my training and research progress.
Environment: The Ho laboratory at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) is a leading group
in the study of SARS-CoV-2, with expertise in the characterization of viral variants and monoclonal antibodies.
This enriching environment provides access to a large network of collaborators including experts in cryo-electron
microscopy, single cell sequencing, and antibody repertoire analysis. CUIMC also has a strong track record of
enabling junior physician-scientists to develop independent and successful careers in academic medicine.
Approach: Our central hypothesis is that primary vaccination targeting the SARS-CoV-2 D614G strain induces
immunological imprinting that restricts antibody responses to subsequently encountered viral variant antigens.
In Aim 1, we will test the impact of imprinting on NAb responses following BA.4/5 boosting strategies in a
humanized mouse model. In Aim 2, we will characterize the antibody repertoires of immunized mice to identify
imprinting effects using single B cell sequencing and bioinformatic approaches. In Aim 3, we will use high-
throughput techniques to produce monoclonal antibodies, determine their neutralizing activity, and identify
epitopes associated with imprinting responses though structural and binding assays. Through these aims, we
will expand understanding of the immunologic and structural basis underlying imprinting in SARS-CoV-2. Our
results should inform novel strategies for structure-based vaccine design to circumvent imprinting responses and
produce broader immunity to SARS-CoV-2 variants and possibly other antigenically variable pathogens."
10789852,"The goal of this grant is to elucidate key mechanisms of TDP-43 aggregation by uncovering how this process
leads to pathology and neurotoxicity. TDP-43 aggregation is the pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS) and half of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. In addition, TDP-43 lesions are a secondary
pathology in approximately 50% of Alzheimer's disease. A major goal in combatting ALS and FTD has been to
reduce the accumulation of TDP-43 inclusions by developing strategies to prevent or reverse TDP-43
aggregation. Recognizing this, we established strategic methods to study the aggregation of this RNA binding
protein using purified TDP-43 and have identified previously unknown aggregate intermediates. These are
early stage oligomers that share key characteristics with toxic oligomeric species of well-studied proteins linked
to neurodegeneration, including Tau, amyloid-β and α-synuclein. These TDP-43 aggregate intermediates are
capable of seeding de novo intracellular TDP-43 aggregation and their formation is accelerated by ALS-linked
mutations. Our recent findings provide the unique opportunity to shed light on fundamental mechanisms of
TDP-43 aggregation, determine their role in pathogenesis and provide models to block TDP-43 pathology. Aim
1 will establish the presence of TDP-43 oligomers in cellular models of aggregation and in ALS and FTD-
derived tissue. In particular, we will examine recruitment of the intermediates to cytoplasmic stress granules,
which are protein-RNA rich bodies considered to be crucibles of pathological aggregation. This will be
achieved using our established methods of detection and by developing antibodies specific for the intermediate
complexes. To establish the role of the newly found TDP-43 intermediates in aggregation and pathogenesis,
Aim 2 will define the molecular determinants of assembly and test how disease-associated conditions
upregulate this process. After identifying the protein regions mediating oligomerization, we will ask whether
aggregation and intracellular seeding function decrease upon disruption of the newly identified epitopes. The
ability of TDP-43 aggregates to act as agents of pathological spread in disease is strongly suggested by recent
findings that FTD-derived extracts seed and propagate TDP-43 pathology in mouse brain. Aim 3 will test
whether TDP-43 aggregates alone can indeed initiate de novo aggregation and propagation of pathology in
vivo. We will analyze the spread of TDP-43 pathology upon injection of early and late stage TDP-43
aggregates derived from purified protein in the brain of mice. This will establish whether TDP-43 aggregates,
and TDP-43 oligomers in particular, are primary sources of nucleation and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, these
studies we will determine whether this propagation directly correlates with increased neurodegeneration. With
the successful completion of this grant, we will: a) define fundamental processes in TDP-43 aggregation; b)
establish in vitro and in vivo models to forestall neurotoxicity in ALS and FTD; and c) provide unprecedented
tools for the development of diagnostic markers of disease."

10799397,"Project Summary/Abstract
During the initial funding period, we applied aptamer-based proteomic analysis (SomaLogic) to investigate
cardiometabolic disease among African Americans (AAs) in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS). In published studies,
we identified novel biomarkers that are associated with the development of left ventricular hypertrophy, CHF and
with CKD over a decade before the onset of clinical disease, including plasma proteins that are differentially
associated with outcomes in individuals of predominantly African vs. European ancestry. We also described how
whole genome sequence analysis of the plasma proteome in individuals with African ancestry increases our
power to detect novel genetic determinants. In addition to identifying over 100 new locus-protein associations,
the associations suggest new mechanisms of genetically mediated diseases linked to African ancestry. We
identified a novel association between variants in APOL1 and the protein CKAP2, as well as an association
between ATTR amyloidosis and RBP4 levels in community dwelling individuals without CHF.
In unpublished work, we have also identified novel determinants of incident CHD, including Secreted
Transmembrane Protein 1 (SECTM1), a poorly characterized protein with potential chemotactic activity for
monocytes. In follow-up in silico analyses, SNPs associated with circulating SECTM1 levels are also associated
with the monocyte percentage of white blood cells in large human databases. Further, our pilot experiments in
mice demonstrate that short term administration of recombinant SECTM1a (mouse homologue) increases pro-
atherogenic and inflammatory Ly6Chi circulating monocytes, as well as monocyte progenitors in the bone
marrow. These data suggest that SECTM1 may be a novel regulator of monocyte biology that contributes to
CHD. More broadly, we have shown that large-scale proteomic profiling in well-characterized populations can
identify proteins and pathways that may be causal for adverse cardiometabolic conditions.
In this renewal, we will first extend our discovery efforts of novel biomarkers of incident CHD and its risk factors
using the recently expanded, highly specific Olink 3,000-plex platform (Aim 1), which includes >2100 proteins
that have not been assayed in a large number of AAs. In Aim 2, fine mapping of protein-associated genetic
variants, co-localization studies with established CHD-associated variants, and Mendelian Randomization
experiments will be used to assess causality of protein-associated variants for CHD, CKD, and other
cardiometabolic conditions. For both Aims 1 & 2, findings will be replicated in a multi-ethnic population (MESA),
and extended through multi-omic analyses involving extensive metabolomic data available in both JHS and
MESA. Putative causal variants that emerge from these analyses will be validated in model systems in Aim 3,
with initial studies focusing on SECTM1’s atherogenic potential in mouse models. In addition to SECTM1, we
anticipate follow-up investigations of two other proteins highlighted by our discovery work. All data from this multi-
institutional collaboration will be made publicly available in real time for the entire scientific community."
10797048,"SUMMARY
The overall goal of this work is to understand the neural basis of human consciousness and its modulation by
anesthetic agents. State and contents are two aspects of consciousness that have been mostly studied
independently. State refers to an organism's overall conscious condition that has been traditionally expressed
as the level of consciousness. Contents of consciousness refer to perceptual experiences of various kinds (e.g.,
experiences of a red rose). Recent definitions of state include some element of enabling content, highlighting
the inter-relatedness. However, this has not been formally studied in the context of the brain’s large-scale
functional organizations. We aim to fill this knowledge gap by discovering the neural mechanisms by which the
state and contents are interrelated and how their relationship is altered during anesthetic exposure. Our central
hypothesis is that a change in the state of consciousness can affect the quality of conscious contents. Further,
the state-content interaction is associated with a cooperation between the anterior forebrain mesocircuit and
cortical macrocircuit, and the cooperation is controlled by specific subcortical and cortical areas. The hypothesis
will be tested by three Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will apply functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
determine how conscious contents, assessed by a near-threshold perceptual task, are degraded during
anesthetic exposure. We hypothesize that suppressing the state of consciousness will diminish the quality of
conscious contents, which will be associated with functional alterations in three key brain areas: anterior insular
cortex (AIC) for content-gating, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for content-broadcasting, and central
thalamus (CT) for mediating both content gating and broadcasting. In Aim 2 we will test the causal involvement
of these areas in the state-content interaction through a perturbational approach. In participants during light
sedation with propofol (or placebo), we will apply transcranial low intensity focused ultrasound pulsation (LIFUP)
to noninvasively stimulate the CT, AIC or DLPFC and assess their effects on perceptual quality and brain activity
by fMRI. Given our preliminary results, we anticipate that stimulating these areas will lead to differential
perceptual outcomes (e.g., a change in subjective perceptual criterion alone, detection sensitivity alone, or both).
In Aim 3 we will determine if stimulating these brain areas during deep sedation with propofol or
dexmedetomidine titrated to unresponsiveness can restore the state of consciousness. We anticipate that
stimulating the CT will produce behavioral signs of wakefulness and command-following in association with
restoration of the macroscale functional hierarchy across unimodal and transmodal areas. The results should
help gain a principled understanding of the role of functional reorganization of the brain in exogenously induced
restoration of consciousness. Taken together, the proposed research is significant because it is expected to
make major progress towards understanding of the fundamental neural mechanisms of the anesthetic
modulation of human consciousness and clarifying the causal relationship of state vs. contents of consciousness."

10926889,"Project Summary/Abstract
Eukaryotic cells require the tight regulation of global gene expression to maintain homeostasis
and respond to environmental stimuli. DNA spools around histone proteins form this vital
structure, chromatin, and provide a platform for the sophisticated tuning of gene expression
through physical and chemical regulation. Unsurprisingly, the disruption of these chromatin
regulatory mechanisms is particularly prevalent in cancers as a driver of disease. Completion of
the proposed projects will shed light on the mechanisms of healthy chromatin regulation and its
disruption in disease, providing the insight necessary to develop improved therapeutic
interventions in a variety of cancers.
 In the F99 phase of this proposal, I study disrupted chromatin signaling by Hepatitis B
Virus (HBV), a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. HBV maintains chronic
infections within hepatocytes by establishing an independent minichromosome, termed covalently
closed circular DNA (cccDNA), that largely evades immune detection and conventional chromatin
regulatory mechanisms. Further contributing to this evasion is the viral protein HBx, which has
documented roles redirecting numerous chromatin effectors, including transcription factors,
degradation machinery, and epigenome modifiers. So far in my thesis work, I have developed a
platform to reconstitute cccDNA in vitro for biochemical and biophysical studies, determined that
histone occupancy in cccDNA is required for HBx expression, and shown that HBx binds directly
to nucleosomes. The remainder of my thesis work will be spent testing the biochemical effects of
other known interactors on cccDNA compaction and gene expression and illuminating the
cccDNA landscape in cells using locus-specific proteomic and epigenomic studies.
 The K00 phase shifts focus to ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes, a class of
proteins shown to be mutated or overexpressed in more than 20% of cancers. In particular, I
intend to study the CHD family of remodelers, which have been implicated as drivers of a variety
of cancer types. I will apply my expertise in chromatin biochemistry and expand my technical
repertoire to include cryo-electron microscopy as a means to study the structure and function of
CHD chromatin remodelers. In parallel, I will develop skills in gene editing techniques to knockout
wild-type enzyme and introduce clinically-relevant CHD mutants into cells for epigenomic
analyses of remodeler dysfunction in disease. Combining these new approaches with my
background in biochemistry, chemical biology, and biophysics will position me to address pressing
questions in chromatin and cancer biology throughout the rest of my career as I pursue an
independent, cancer-focused faculty position."

Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a destructive interstitial lung disease (ILD) characterized by profound scarring. In
severe PF, death generally ensues within 3-5 years. While current classification criteria guide diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment of PF, substantial heterogeneity in PF phenotypes limit the utility of these criteria.
Many patients classified as idiopathic PF may belong to alternative PF subclasses, and a significant minority of
patients are unclassifiable. Recent genomic advances have identified factors that influence heterogeneity in PF
however, exclusion of major racial groups from these genetic studies limits the generalizability of their findings.
In this proposal, I aim to improve disease classification and outcome prediction in patients with PF. I will do this using
cutting-edge statistical tools and DNA samples collected from patients across diverse races. My central hypothesis is
that inclusion of genomic biomarkers from diverse races into a cluster-based model will lead to better PF
classification. I will first perform targeted genotyping for PF-associated gene variants and measure telomere lengths
to determine their variation across US racial groups with PF. I will then derive and validate a PF cluster model using
clinical data from racially diverse PF populations and determine the additional value of genomic data on outcome
prediction. Finally, using this model, I will determine heterogeneity of treatment effect on outcomes across patients
prospectively enrolled in national PF registries. Successful completion of this proposal will result in a validated
Clusters Across Subgroups of Pulmonary Fibrosis (CLASS-PF) model applicable in patients from diverse races to
improve PF classification and outcome prediction. My preliminary studies in clinical prediction modeling, and completion
of a Master’s Degree in Public Health Sciences have provided a solid foundation for success in this investigation.
My long-term career goal is to utilize genetic data from diverse races to improve clinical decision-making and
outcomes for patients with PF. To achieve this, I have formulated a career development plan that will provide
exceptional mentorship, and training in genomic analyses, statistical genetics, big-data analysis and clinical
trials. Leading experts in ILD, genetics, and risk-stratification modeling will mentor me. I have also assembled a
multidisciplinary advisory committee with expertise in telomere disorders, clinical trials, and biorepository
processing. The outlined work will be performed at the University of Chicago, an institution with established
track record of excellence in patient-oriented research, and abundant resources for collaboration. This K23
award is fundamental to achieve successfully the goals outlined in this proposal, as it will provide dedicated
time to attain these realistic milestones and acquire the skills to independently develop genomic prediction
tools that integrate clinical phenotype data for subsequent validation in clinical trials. This work will provide an
invaluable pharmacogenomic resource for studying PF across diverse races, and improve PF classification
and prediction thus channeling discovery into translation and ultimately to clinical implementation."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under RFA-
DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and will track
their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health, and
culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping) interact
with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral, academic,
health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen time,
sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6) characterize
relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances such as
cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive, emotional,
and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10818382,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a highly deadly disease with a five-year survival rate of only 10%.
The bulk of the PDA tumor volume is composed of a reactive fibroinflammatory tumor microenvironment that
assists in the growth and maintenance of the tumor. The highly immunosuppressive nature of the pancreatic
tumor microenvironment is also responsible, in part, for the continued inefficacy of immunotherapy treatments
in PDA patients. Despite numerous studies that have previously examined different facets of PDA
immunosuppression, there is still much that is unknown regarding the complex network of intercellular
crosstalk that regulates this phenomenon. Our previous work has demonstrated that infiltrating macrophages
are essential mediators of immunosuppression in PDA, and that their polarization is affected by the expression
of oncogenic Kras in tumor cells. Other groups have characterized the immunosuppressive impact of certain
fibroblast subgroups within the pancreatic tumor microenvironment. Preliminary experiments described in this
proposal demonstrate a connection between fibroblasts, macrophages, and tumor cells through fibroblast
expression of the cytokine interleukin-33 (IL33). The role of IL33 in cancer biology is controversial, with its
overall effect on the tumor thought to be supportive or suppressive depending on the cancer context. Here,
results show that IL33 abundance correlates with disease progression and that fibroblast expression of IL33 is
dependent on oncogenic Kras-driven signals from tumor cells. Additionally, we have completed a pilot
experiment whereby we have orthotopically implanted pancreatic tumor cells into a syngeneic genetically
engineered mouse model lacking Il33 in fibroblasts (Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+). Tumors from Il33-deficient mice
had slower tumor growth and a trending decrease in macrophage infiltration, suggesting that fibroblast-derived
Il33 is both tumor promoting and may play a role in the recruitment of immunosuppressive macrophages.
Therefore, the overall objective of this study is to elucidate the cellular interactions that contribute to the
establishment and maintenance of immunosuppression in PDA, and the central hypothesis is that fibroblast
derived IL33 is a key regulator of immunosuppression in the pancreatic tumor microenvironment through its
modulation of macrophage infiltration. This hypothesis will be investigated through the following two Aims:
(Aim 1) define the regulation and role of IL33 in cancer-associated fibroblasts, and (Aim 2) assess the impact
of IL33 on the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. To complete this investigation, a combination of
in vitro assays using tumor cell, fibroblast, and macrophage cultures will be performed. We also will continue to
utilize the Il33f/f, Pdgfra-CreERT2/+ genetically engineered mouse model to assess Il33-dependent changes in
the immunosuppressive nature of pancreatic tumors. The data accumulated by this study will further the field’s
understanding of immunosuppression regulation in PDA, and consequentially bring effective immunotherapy
strategies one step closer to becoming a viable therapeutic option."
10819555,"With prevalence as high as 55% for individuals aged 55 and older in United States, hypertension (HTN) is a
major risk factor contributing to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and global mortality, hence remaining an
increasingly important medical and public health issue. The role of the brain renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in
the maintenance of normal blood pressure (BP) and in the neuro-cardiovascular dysregulation leading to HTN
has been firmly established. Angiotensin (Ang)-II, by means of its type 1 receptor (AT1R), promotes increased
sympathetic nerve activity, salt and water reabsorption, vasoconstriction, aldosterone and vasopressin release
and inflammation, all contributing to HTN. While numerous overexpression studies, from our group and others,
have established the benefits of ACE2 (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme type 2) in preventing the progression
and improving the treatment of HTN in experimental models, our group was the first to demonstrate that ADAM17
(A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease) mediates ACE2 shedding in neurogenic HTN, thus reducing ACE2
compensatory activity in mice and humans. ADAM17-mediated ACE2 shedding, a process by which the protein
ectodomain is cleaved from the plasma membrane and secreted into the surrounding milieu, has since been
confirmed in many tissues including heart and kidney. ADAM17 is thought to mediate neuroinflammation through
soluble TNFα, IL-6 trans-signaling, CX3CL1 and other cytokines, yet this mechanism has not been studied in
neurogenic HTN. DOCA-salt HTN is associated with increased levels of TNFα, IL-6 and reduced ACE2 activity
in the brain, while deletion of ADAM17 from neurons reduces BP, restores ACE2 activity and decreases pro-
inflammatory cytokines. Although ADAM17 is thought to be a major drug target for inflammation, the
development of selective inhibitors has failed. Recent work, deemed revolutionary, shows that ADAM17
maturation is tightly regulated by rhomboid proteins in the brain (iRhom1 in neurons and iRhom2 in microglia),
opening the door for novel targeting strategies. Accordingly, we hypothesize that targeting ADAM17 maturation
will reverse sympatho-excitation and neuro-inflammation in neurogenic HTN. We will test this new
targeting strategy in the following two specific aims.
Using a combination of human stem cells-derived neurons and microglia, unique transgenic and conditional
knockout mice, with selective deletion of ADAM17 in microglia (Cx3Cr1ERT2-ADAM17tom) and targeted
knockdown of ADAM17 maturation in neurons (Rhom1) or microglia (iRhom2), the immediate objectives of this
application are to: 1) Understand how ADAM17 upregulation takes place throughout pre-sympathetic networks;
2) Assess the feed-forward role of ADAM17 in neuro-inflammation and microglia activation; and 3) Test new
clinically-relevant targeting strategies to prevent ADAM17 activation and the development of resistant HTN."
10819565,"More than 80% of patients with refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) respond to CD19-
targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. Yet, 50% of these patients will relapse. CD19
antigen loss is a common mechanism for CD19-CAR therapy failure in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-
ALL), and similar data is now emerging for DLBCL patients. CD22 is a B-cell malignancy associated antigen
and a small Phase I trial of CD22-CAR therapy has shown promise in B-ALL even in those patients who failed
CD19-CAR therapy. Interesting, CD22 antigen escape was also seen in these B-ALL patients. In preclinical
models, high antigen density was associated with optimal CAR T cell response, however the role of antigen
density's impact on clinical response has not been fully investigated. This CD22-CAR therapy has yet to be
evaluated in refractory DLBCL patients and the role of CD22 antigen density's impact on response and relapse
is unknown. Based on these observations, Dr. Frank, an Instructor in the Division of Blood and Marrow
Transplantation at Stanford University, has proposed in his K08 application to investigate novel CAR therapies
in DLBCL patients while undergoing an intensive training program to prepare him to launch an independent
translational research program. Dr. Frank's training plan focuses on developing additional skills in clinical trial
design and management; and in gaining advanced expertise in immunology and bioinformatic methods. This
training will nicely harmonize with his three research aims. He proposes to conduct a Phase I trial investigating
the safety and efficacy of this CD22-CAR therapy in patients with refractory DLBCL. Second, he wishes to
determine whether surface antigen density impacts clinical response and relapse for patients receiving CD22-
CAR therapy and whether antigen evasion can be mitigated by a bispecific CD19/CD22-CAR therapy, currently
being investigated in DLBCL patients. Third, he desires to investigate how CAR T therapy influences
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) dynamics in patients undergoing CD22-CAR and CD19/CD22-CAR therapy to
optimize post-treatment surveillance strategies. As part of this third aim, he proposes to use a Stanford-
developed ctDNA technology, CAPP-Seq, to identify mutations associated with CAR therapy resistance. To
oversee Dr. Frank's training and research, he will be mentored by Drs. Crystal Mackall and David Miklos,
leading experts in CAR T cell therapy. In addition, Dr. Frank has recruited Dr. Ronald Levy, a world-renowned
leader in lymphoma and immune-based therapies, and Dr. Ash Alizadeh, a leading expert in ctDNA
technologies, to serve as advisors and potential collaborators in his training and in accomplishing his aims. In
carrying out his proposed research and training plan under the guidance of outstanding mentorship, Dr. Frank
will be equipped to compete for R01 level of funding, publish high-level papers, and to launch an independent
career leading a translational research program."

The primary mission of the G-RISE Scholars Program at the University of Texas at El
Paso (UTEP) is to increase the participation of underrepresented minority (URM) Ph.D.
trainees in biomedical/biochemical research. The rationale for this program is based on
the stated goals of the NIH to increase URM representation at all levels of the Ph.D.
pipeline. The UTEP G-RISE Program will be an inter-departmental training program with
trainees in the Biosciences and the Chemistry and Biochemistry Ph.D. programs. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to significantly increase the participation of URM
doctoral students in the Biosciences and Chemistry/Biochemistry programs over the next
5 years and successfully prepare them for careers in the research workforce using
effective, evidence-informed approaches. To accomplish our goal, we will pursue the
following specific objectives: (1) Increase the number of URM students that enroll in
UTEP's Biosciences and Chemistry and Biochemistry Ph.D. programs; (2) Ensure that
the majority of trainees graduate within six years in the program; (3) Ensure that trainees
and faculty mentors participate in all G-RISE training activities and comply with training
grant requirements; and (4) Expect that all trainees will publish at least two peer-
reviewed manuscript(s) prior to graduation. The current proposal is modeled on the
successful implementation of RISE undergraduate and graduate training program. Due
in part to this program, the Biosciences Ph.D. program was able to increase URM
representation (primarily Mexican-American) to 75% since the implementation of the
program. In this proposal, we are specifically requesting to train 12 first year Ph.D.
trainees per year that will be appointed for 3 years each. The G-RISE intended
outcomes are to significantly enhance our existing graduate programs by increasing the
number of trainees, by adding valuable training workshops for all graduate students, and
by lowering the years to degree. The G-RISE graduate trainees will also receive
enhanced mentorship and guidance from the PD and Co-PDs who will counsel them at
important junctures and checkpoints during their graduate careers. The goals and
objectives that have been proposed in this application should allow us to continue to
generate a highly talented pool of trainees with a genuine interest in pursuing academic
biomedical research careers."
10819572,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the potentially pivotal and interactive roles of individual
platelet expression of FcγRIIa [SA-1] and wall shear stress (WSS) calculated from patient-specific CT
angiography (CTA) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) [SA-2] to explain recurrent ischemia after minor
stroke or TIA due to ICAD. A precision model is developed [SA-3] to quantify risk of recurrent ischemic injury,
accounting for FcγRIIa, WSS, anti-platelet therapies and platelet reactivity, across a diverse population of
stroke and TIA patients with ICAD. Our central hypothesis is that high FcγRIIa plus high shear force pose
individual and synergistic risk of stroke recurrence, providing a rational basis for the precision medicine of
stroke prevention in ICAD. Our preliminary data reveal that greater platelet FcγRIIa expression identifies
patients at greater risk of recurrent cardiovascular events including stroke and that high WSS on CTA CFD
predicts recurrent stroke due to ICAD at 1 year. Our three independent specific aims leverage an established
research infrastructure and ICAD network of 6 geographically distinct enrolling sites with race-ethnic diverse
populations and a longstanding history of productive collaboration to recruit 250 participants with acute
cerebral ischemia within 72 hours from symptom onset. The multicenter, observational study will enroll stroke
or TIA patients due to 50-99% ICAD diagnosed on routinely acquired CTA and obtain brain MRI and blood
sampling for FcγRIIa and platelet assays within 72 hours and again at 1 year after onset. Clinical outcomes will
be ascertained at 90 days and at 1 year, with co-registration of serial MRI to quantify interval silent and
symptomatic ischemic injury. The Platelet Biology Core at University of Vermont will quantify platelet FcγRIIa
expression. The Neurovascular Imaging Research Core at UCLA will conduct central imaging analyses,
including CTA CFD quantification of WSS, serial MRI co-registration and imaging adjudication of eligibility
and interval endpoints. The Statistical Core will coordinate data management from 6 enrolling sites and the
core facilities, conducting predictive statistics, stratification of key biological variables and novel application of
clustering analytic strategies to maximally inform a precision model of ICAD stroke risk at 1 year. This timely
culmination of synergistic work on shear stress-induced platelet activation in ICAD leverages our robust
preliminary data on FcγRIIa, CTA CFD of WSS and precision medicine analytics in stroke, layered on a
successful track record of multicenter, observational studies of the most common cause of recurrent stroke.
Measurement of individual differences in FcγRIIa and shear stress induced by heterogenous arterial stenoses
inform a logical precision medicine strategy to avert stroke. This novel strategy of using diagnostic data easily
acquired shortly after stroke or TIA due to ICAD has clear implications for clinical translation via precision
medicine enabling individualized stroke treatment, focused on mechanisms of platelet pathophysiology while
addressing clinical events and silent, insidious brain damage due to recurrent ischemia distal to the plaque."
10819574,"Project Summary
 Two of the earliest onset, most common, and costly neurodevelopmental disorders in child psychiatry
are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The clinical
heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represents a fundamentally
confounding factor limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment. In short, simple
design assumptions regarding `homogeneity in samples' in typical and atypical populations may explain the
frequently very small effect sizes in psychopathology research. Clinically, these same assumptions may
account for why treatments often have weak or unpredictable effects.
 Recent developments in the computational sciences, have enabled the implementation of models
sufficiently complex to address the aforementioned situation regarding subpopulations; however, very few tie
the outputs to the specific outcome or questions being asked by the investigator. Under the parent grant, we
developed and published a novel hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning method to characterize
biologically relevant heterogeneity in ADHD and/or ASD – the Functional Random Forest (FRF). The hybrid
FRF combines machine learning and graph theoretic analyses in order to identify population subtypes related
to the clinically most important outcomes (in the case, of this proposal, negative valence symptoms) trans-
diagnostically (ASD, ADHD, TD).
 Despite developing the FRF, subtyping results using functional MRI (fMRI) signals have lagged behind
the subtyping of behavioral profiles. In addition, they have yet to become sufficiently sensitive and specific, for
rapid translation into clinical practice. Fortunately, parallel advances in functional neuroimaging, allow for
precision functional mapping of individuals, and can be synergistically combined with the FRF to greatly boost
our ability to subtype and characterize individual patients from fMRI data. Here we combine the FRF with
precision mapping to reveal common variants and individual specificity in global brain organization. The
proposed individual-specific precision mapping moves beyond group averaging approaches, which are
obscuring important inter-individual differences related to distinct pathophysiologies underlying negative
valence across diagnoses (ADHD, ASD, TD).
 Thus, the current proposal aims to apply FRF algorithms to trans-diagnostic (TD, ASD, ADHD)
behavioral and precision functional mapping RSFC data to identify distinct sub-populations across ASD,
ADHD, and TD that relate to negative valence symptom dimensions."
10819471,"Glaucoma is a complex neurodegenerative blinding disease that causes the degeneration of retinal ganglion
cells and their axons. The prevalence of glaucoma is projected to increase by almost 50% over the next two
decades as older people making up the fastest growing part of the global population. The burden of glaucoma
care will therefore continue to grow, without a competing increase in the number of ophthalmologists or
available resources. As a result, the required demand for glaucoma care will likely exceed capacity and
resources leading to prioritizing care for those patients at highest risk of vision loss. There is no concrete
evidence in support of an individual test, or group of tests, that show superiority for identifying people at-risk of
developing glaucoma or those at higher risk of glaucoma progression. Glaucoma risk factors are too
insensitive in identifying individuals who will likely develop glaucoma. Fundus photographs lack detailed and
high-resolution information of the optic disc and surrounding retinal nerve fiber layer for glaucoma assessment
and visual field tests provide surprisingly inconsistent and variable results, especially in subclinical glaucoma
and in patients with more severe visual field loss (both sides of glaucoma spectrum). Although glaucoma is a
highly inheritable disease, genetic factors yet explain only slight segment of all glaucoma. Reliable and
accurate models for detecting individuals at higher risk of visual loss is an unmet need. We propose to use
artificial intelligence (AI) constructs to discover visual field and imaging signatures of glaucoma and synthesize
these signatures with classic risk factors and genetic data to identify individuals at-risk of developing glaucoma
and future vision loss. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that AI applied to fundus photographs, visual
fields and genetic factors may recognize and quantify the glaucoma-induced signs, yielding better signatures
for glaucoma development and vision loss compared to current subjectively specified or conventionally
identified features. As such, we will develop AI models to predict glaucoma from fundus photographs and
visual fields then extract fundus and visual field endophenotypes (signatures) of glaucoma. We will then
develop genome-wide association study (GWAS) and machine learning models to address underpower GWAS
limitation and develop AI models to predict glaucoma from identified genetic markers. We finally develop an AI
construct to synthesizes the discovered fundus and visual field signatures with classic glaucoma risk factors
and genetic data to predict glaucoma. This AI construct can work with any or all of these modalities as well
thus providing a potential tool for screening purposes as well. To achieve these objectives, we have assembled
a team of interdisciplinary experts with access to large clinically annotated multi-modal glaucoma data.
Our proposed studies will potentially uncover novel genetic factors of glaucoma as well as visual field and
imaging endophenotypes of glaucoma that may serve as surrogate endpoints to improve glaucoma clinical
trials and offer improvements in identifying individuals at-risk of developing glaucoma and future vision loss."

Epilepsy affects over 2 million of people in the United States, causing significant morbidity with a high cost to society.
While the behavioral and electrophysiological correlates of seizures in patients and animal models have been studied for
over a century, the underlying circuit abnormalities are still being elucidated. Generalized spike-wave (SW) absence sei-
zures are the most common seizure disorder in children and thought to be exclusively of genetic origin. While over 20
genes are discovered and studied in SW epilepsies, it is still unclear how each genetic lesion impairs normal circuit devel-
opment and ultimately results in a seizure-prone cortical circuit. Since the SW seizure phenotype can be very similar de-
spite disparate genetic etiologies, a stereotypical circuit deficit may exist which underlies the expression of this seizure
pattern. More recently, as we have begun to understand the wiring principles of cortical microcircuits at the level of cell
types, it has become possible to ask how disruption of these canonical networks may be responsible for initiating seizure
activity and impairing cognitive functions in SW epilepsies, whether the pathogenic circuit changes overlap despite dis-
parate molecular lesions, and how a seizure-prone circuit emerges from inherited molecular defects to favor seizure on-
set at predictable developmental time-points. This information not only suggests novel and broadly-applicable therapeu-
tic targets, but also leads to valuable insights into the functional roles of distinct cell types and specific connectivity
principles in normal brain. To answer these important questions, we are taking advantage of three mouse models of ab-
sence epilepsy, stargazer, tottering and Gabrg2 mutant mice, which harbor mutations in three unrelated genes but share
the same SW phenotype, and propose a comprehensive microcircuit comparison among distinct genotypes at the level
of cell types and their connections. We perform a large-scale circuit analysis across a whole column of the somatosen-
sory cortex (S1) in three models along the seizure development, by leveraging a high-throughput multi-patching method
(up to 12-patch) we recently developed. We will measure multiple neuronal features of distinct cell types within the S1
epileptic circuit, with an emphasis on connectivity and morphology of major groups of cortical GABAergic interneurons.
In parallel, the same analysis will be performed on WT littermates as controls to reveal cell type-specific connectivity
changes as a function of the genotype and developmental stage. These comprehensive, dynamic comparisons, based on
large-scale circuit analyses with sensitive, state-of-the-art methods, will reveal the full extent of abnormal microcircuit
structure and functions that are closely associated with seizure onset. Our preliminary data uncover several connectivity
defects in these models. The most striking is that stereotypical connectivity and morphology of somatostatin-expressing
Martinotti cells are severely disrupted, and this disruption appears to emerge only after seizure onset and is shared by
models, suggesting a common circuit deficit underlying absence epilepsy. The potential causative circuit mechanisms will
be further tested via network modeling and an in vivo chemogenetic assay. Identification of causative circuit deficits gen-
eralized across genetically heterogeneous, yet highly stereotyped SW seizures will direct the field toward the develop-
ment of innovative, broadly applicable circuit-based interventions for absence epilepsy and its related comorbidities."

This project proposes to study the roles of specific amacrine cells (ACs) in the visual signal
processing performed by the mammalian retina. Electrophysiological recordings of light evoked
activity will be made from ACs, ganglion cells (GCs), and bipolar cells in intact in vitro whole-
mount and slice preparations of mouse retina maintained at photopic adaptation levels. The
functional properties of the cells will be probed using images projected onto the photoreceptors
through the microscope objective. Patch-clamp recordings from amacrine and ganglion cell
somas will be performed to measure the stimulus-evoked postsynaptic currents, postsynaptic
potentials, and spiking responses. The project focusses on the elucidating the synaptic
mechanisms underlying the receptive field properties of 3 genetically labelled amacrine cell types.
Aims 1 and 2 examine the functional properties of two types of amacrine cells, so called NOS-1
and NOS-2 amacrine cells, which are identified by their expression of nitric-oxide synthase
(NOS). Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the NOS-1 ACs are key interneurons for controlling the
strength of surround antagonism in GCs at scotopic light levels and that they exert their effects
via GABAergic synaptic connections to AII ACs. We will make dual recordings between the NOS-
1 ACs and specific types of GCs, to directly test for indirect synaptic connections consistent with
the proposed circuit. Aim 2 will examine the role of NOS-2 ACs in conferring motion-sensitivity to
specific type of small-field GCs in the mouse. We will use optogenetic stimulation of ChR2
expressing NOS ACs to identify the postsynaptic targets. The postsynaptic targets will be
identified morphologically and physiologically and inputs arising from NOS-2 ACs will be
confirmed by paired recordings. Aim 3 focuses on a novel amacrine cell type that is one of 2 AC
types that can be identified by their expression of the gene Gbx2. We will focus on the Gbx2+
ACs that stratify in sublamina 3 (S3) of the inner plexiform layer. The S3-Gbx2+ ACs are highly
unusual because they appear to express none of the conventional inhibitory or excitatory
neurotransmitters, indicating that they represent novel populations of so-called non-GABAergic,
non-glycinergic (nGnG) ACs. Preliminary data show that these nGnG ACs are tracer coupled to
bipolar cells. We will quantify the spatio-temporal receptive field properties of these nGnG S3-
Gbx2+ ACs and will test the hypothesis that they make output via electrical synapses with bipolar
cells. To do so, we will make patch-clamp recordings from cone bipolar cells in slice and measure
depolarizing responses elicited by optogenetic stimulation (ChR2 expression) of the S3-Gbx2+
ACs. Overall, the results will reveal the functional properties and connectivity of the three AC
types and will determine their roles in visual processing in the retina."
10819589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and debilitating joint disease affecting over 30 million people in the United States
alone. OA is characterized by the progressive degeneration of cartilage matrix primarily due to an imbalance of
chondrocyte catabolic and anabolic activities arising from genetic, chemical, and mechanical risk factors. Current
non-surgical treatments for OA rely simply on managing symptoms primarily owing to a lack of a full
understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to disease onset and pathogenesis. In recent exome
sequencing studies, genetic mutation in collagen type VI alpha three (COL6A3) has been identified to increase
risk of developing early-onset OA. COL6A3 encodes for one of the proteins that forms collagen type VI (COL6),
a critical component of the chondrocyte’s pericellular matrix (PCM). COL6 is a key mediator of the chondrocyte’s
transduction of chemical and mechanical cues by maintaining the structural integrity of the PCM. It is likely that
mutation in COL6A3 may exacerbate OA by altering PCM properties; however, the mechanisms leading to
disease remain unknown. In this proposal, we will determine the molecular link between COL6A3 mutation and
OA etiopathogenesis. We hypothesize that COL6A3 mutation increases the effect of inflammation on
chondrocyte catabolism and PCM degradation, leading to alterations in the normal chondrocyte
metabolic response to mechanical loading thereby initiating a cycle of cartilage degeneration. To
complete the proposed studies, we have developed a novel in vitro “OA-in-a-dish” disease model using human
induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived chondrocytes gene-edited to introduce the COL6A3 mutation. In
specific aim 1, we will assess the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on the biological and mechanical
properties of hiPSC-derived cartilage with and without the COL6A3 mutation. Then, in specific aim 2, we will
determine the effect of this mutation on chondrocyte mechanotransduction following proinflammatory cytokine
treatment. This proposal aims to determine a mechanistic cause for increased predisposition to early on-set OA
due to mutation in COL6A3, that can be used for the identification of targets for therapeutic development.
Completion of these studies will better define the mechanisms that mechanical, genetic, and biochemical factors
act in concert and lead to OA."
10819590,"Project Summary/Abstract
Stroke is a disorder of the brain by which a part loses its blood supply and the affected region rapidly progresses
to death if blood flow is not restored in time. Treatments to restore blood flow after acute ischemic stroke (AIS)
are effective if administered <4.5 h from the onset of the stroke event. But, due in part to the lack of an in vitro
diagnostic test for AIS, imaging (CT – clinical sensitivity ~26%) at the attending hospital is required for diagnosis.
As a result, <7% of AIS patients receive treatment. Therefore, a critical need exists to develop strategies for
diagnosing stroke in near real time that potentially can allow for point-of-care testing (POCT). One approach is
a peripheral blood test using markers that quickly respond to changes in the brain induced by stroke. The
proposed project will develop innovative technologies that uses peripheral blood markers for diagnosing stroke
syndromes (AIS and hemorrhagic stroke) in near real time (~31 min for sample-to-answer) with an LOD of ~0.03
ng (total RNA). The research team has found that alterations in mRNA expression secured from white blood cell
subsets can be used for stroke diagnosis and appear rapidly in peripheral blood following a stroke event.
Resulting from a prior R01, CD15+ and CD8+ leukocytes were discovered as a predominant source of stroke-
related mRNA biomarkers. This project seeks to realize the development of an innovative fluidic cartridge and
the associated assay for the measurement of stroke-related RNA markers sourced from CD15 and CD8
expressing extracellular vesicles (EVs). The utility of EVs as a source of stroke-related RNA biomarkers is based
on their rapid appearance and high abundance in plasma, potentially providing even faster stroke diagnosis
compared to the cells from which they originate. This project will discover EV-RNA markers with high clinical
sensitivity and specificity (>80%) for diagnosing ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in <3 h from stroke onset. The
cartridge, which consists of task-specific modules made from plastics via replication (i.e., injection molding)
connected to a fluidic motherboard, will use the EV-RNA markers emanating from this project. Plasma will serve
as the input from which surface-affinity selection of CD8 and CD15 EVs will occur using a specifically designed
module. Following EV release from the capture surface via a photocleavable linker (cleaved using a blue-light
LED), the cartridge will quantify the number of EVs selected using a label-free readout strategy. The fluidic
cartridge also consists of a mixed-scale (nm → µm) module to read electrically copy numbers of stroke EV-RNA
markers in a highly multiplexed fashion (>24 targets). This module will consist of in-plane nanopores made in a
plastic via nano-injection molding and can identify RNAs using a distinct oligonucleotide primer pair querying a
specific RNA using a solid-phase ligase detection reaction (spLDR). Single-molecule readout will allow for high
analytical sensitivity to observe subtle changes in EV-RNA marker copy numbers. The utility of this cartridge will
be evaluated in a clinical setting. Success of the project is leveraged by a strong multidisciplinary team, whom
have a productive record of collaboration in developing stroke markers and diagnostic platforms for stroke."
10819512,"The SARS CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in >550,000 deaths in the USA alone. Therapeutic options for critically
ill patients with COVID-19 are limited. Prior studies showed that development of severe hypoxemia and lung
inflammation in influenza A virus-infected mice is associated with inhibition of de novo phospholipid synthesis in
alveolar type II (ATII) cells. Post-infection treatment of influenza A virus-infected mice with the liponucleotide
CDP-choline, which is an essential precursor for de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis, improves gas exchange
and reduces pulmonary inflammation without altering viral replication. In addition, treatment of SARS CoV-2-
infected K18-hACE2-transgenic mice with CDP-choline prevents development of hypoxemia and attenuates lung
inflammation. Finally, treatment of both influenza A-infected and SARS CoV-2-infected human precision cut lung
slices with CDP-choline reduces production of inflammatory mediators. These findings suggest that impaired
ATII cell de novo phospholipid synthesis is a common feature of viral lung injury that contributes significantly to
development of hypoxemia and pulmonary inflammation. It is hypothesized that administration of citicoline (the
pharmaceutical form of CDP-choline, which is approved for human use in Europe) will be safe in critically ill
patients with COVID-19 and that preliminary evidence of clinical benefit to support a larger Phase 2 trial will be
obtained for one or more citicoline doses. These hypotheses will be tested in a milestone-driven, blinded,
placebo-controlled, and randomized Phase 1 dose-ranging and safety study of citicoline in consented adults of
any sex, gender, age, or ethnicity admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. The trial is named “SCARLET”
(Supplemental Citicoline Administration to Reduce Lung injury Efficacy Trial). SCARLET will show that i.v.
citicoline is safe at one or more of three doses in critically ill COVID-19 patients (20 per dose) and provide
preliminary evidence that i.v. citicoline improves pulmonary outcomes in this population. The primary efficacy
outcome will be the ratio of blood oxygen saturation to inspired oxygen concentration ( SpO2:FiO2) on Study Day
3. Exploratory outcomes include Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, dead space ventilation
index, and lung compliance. Citicoline effects on a panel of COVID-relevant lung and blood biomarkers will also
be determined. The study population will consist primarily of COVID-19 patients from underserved minorities in
Columbus and central Appalachia and contingency plans are in place to enroll patients from the University of
Cincinnati should a local decrease in COVID-19 incidence necessitate this. If successful, a Phase 2 trial of
citicoline, incorporating SMART design and with survival as the primary outcome measure, will be conducted to
confirm citicoline efficacy, which could facilitate rapid transition of citicoline to the clinic and potentially transform
the management of critically ill patients with severe SARS CoV-2-induced hypoxemic respiratory failure."
10819514,"Project Summary
For a wide range of diseases, peptides could provide immense therapeutic benefit, however the short half-lives
of peptides in biological environments hinder their translation to clinical use. Immune system-mediated
clearance, renal filtration of structures smaller than 20 nm (such as peptides), and enzymatic degradation all
contribute to the short half-lives of peptides. Conjugating peptides to polymers can overcome many of these
obstacles and prolong half-life, similarly as in the case of PEG-INTRONTM, a star-shaped polymer decorated with
the protein therapeutic interferon alfa-2b that prolongs half-life of the protein and enables its use to treat cancer
and hepatitis, among other conditions. However, conjugation of peptides to polymers may also detract
substantially from the therapeutic function. For example, attachment of an antimicrobial peptide to one end of a
polymer reduces toxicity to mammalian cells, but also markedly reduces antimicrobial activity. On the other
hand, attaching multiple antimicrobial peptides to a polymer chain can improve activity by enabling multivalent
interactions of peptides with biological targets (e.g., pathogenic microbes), but may also cause undesired toxic
effects to mammalian cells. The overall goal of this proposal and a major thrust of my research group is to
leverage advances in polymer chemistry that enable precision control of polymer composition, molecular weight,
architecture, and supramolecular assembly to optimize presentation of therapeutic peptides. By varying the
density and number of peptides pendent to a water-soluble polymer chain, we aim to maximize the function and
therapeutic benefit of peptides designed to combat infectious disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. One
set of conjugates will feature antimicrobial peptides, and another will feature peptides we designed to bind and
sequester toxic poly(dipepetide)s implicated in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis via stereochemistry-driven
interactions. We will characterize the size, morphology, surface charge, and stability of the polymer-peptide
conjugate variants, and interactions with biological targets to connect conjugate structure to these therapeutically
relevant biophysical properties. In other situations, chemical modification of peptides in any arrangement can
abrogate the intended function; in these cases, physical encapsulation of the peptides within polymer particles
provides an excellent alternative. By modulating both the percentage and arrangement of charge-neutral groups
in otherwise anionic polymers, we aim to control the stability, as well as the loading and release rates of cationic
therapeutic peptides. Together, these studies will provide critical insight regarding formulating peptides with
polymers to optimize therapeutic function and thereby accelerate the clinical implementation of this important
class of therapeutics."

The Meharry G-RISE program is designed to address the lack of diversity within all facets of the United Stated
biomedical research workforce by significantly increasing the number of minority students pursuing biomedical
and behavioral sciences research careers. Meharry Medical College has a strong record of graduating PhDs in
biomedical science disciplines, many of whom obtain positions in academic institutions, government or industry
where they continue the tradition of teaching, research and service that is a part of our mission. The College as
a whole has a proven commitment to educating underrepresented minorities (URM). Since 1972, the Graduate
School has awarded 307 PhDs in Biomedical Sciences. Therefore, it has a proven record of preparing students
for research careers with a strong focus in diseases that disproportionally affect minorities. The Meharry G-RISE
program will build upon the success of our current RISE program, which has supported 188 students since 1999
and to date graduated 108 PhDs with degrees in biomedical science. This G-RISE program will allow us, together
with other programs at Meharry, to provide the infrastructure and activities needed to continue to graduate more
minorities in biomedical and behavioral sciences at the doctoral level. The overall mission of the Meharry G-
RISE program is to provide PhD students within the School of Graduate Studies and Research at Meharry
Medical College with the knowledge and expertise needed to pursue research careers in academia, industry or
other alternative career venues. Three specific aims are proposed in the current G-RISE application: 1) To
provide excellent training in biomedical research to URM students that emphasizes critical thinking, data science
and collaborative/team science approaches and allows for completion of PhD degree requirements within a
timely fashion; 2) To strengthen written and oral communication skills and provide professional skills training to
program trainees; 3) To create a supportive training environment by promoting healthy mentor/mentee
relationships. The proposed program will support a cohort of 8 PhD trainees each year for five years, appointing
each trainee for 2 to 3 years. A set of well-defined activities has been developed to help transition PhD students
into research careers in biomedical sciences. These activities include multidisciplinary, rigorous research training
opportunities with faculty committed to the success of URM students and specialty courses such as Advances
in Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics. Student training will be enhanced by the opportunity to complete a
certificate program in Biomedical Data Science. Trainees will also participate in a robust career development
curriculum that prepares them for postdoctoral positions and ultimately a variety of careers within the biomedical
research workforce. Program outcomes will include an increase in the number of PhD students that complete
degree requirements in a timely fashion and a more diverse pool of well-trained biomedical scientists with the
technical, operational and professional skills needed for career success."
10819548,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a debilitating disease of the synovial joints and is the leading cause of pain and disability
worldwide. OA affects over 30 million Americans, but there are no disease modifying drugs. Obesity is a major
risk factor for OA; however, it has been difficult to disentangle the role of low-level systemic inflammation from
the effects of altered joint loading with increased body mass. While cartilage requires loading to maintain tissue
homeostasis, previous studies have suggested that abnormal loading due to increased body mass may explain
why individuals with obesity experience cartilage damage at elevated rates when compared to healthy weight
individuals. However, many recent studies demonstrate that increased body mass alone does not explain OA
damage in human and animal models, and that adipokines, inflammatory mediators from body fat, play an
important role in OA pathogenesis. Additionally, previous studies from the Guilak lab highlight the synergistic
importance of the mechanosensitive ion channels Piezo1 and Piezo2 in cartilage health and maintenance:
obesity and an OA-relevant inflammatory mediator, interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1α), modulates and sensitizes Piezo
channel function. As such, this proposal investigates if cytokine/adipokine signaling is the mechanism by which
Piezo channels become hypersensitized to mechanical force, ultimately leading to increased chondrocyte death.
The goal of this proposal is to directly investigate the interaction between obesity-associated inflammation and
the mechanosensitivity of chondrocytes. This study on the role of altered mechanosensation in the pathogenesis
of OA with obesity will lead to the ultimate goal of targeting these pathways to develop novel therapeutic
approaches. Specific Aim 1 focuses on determining if obesity-associated inflammatory conditions alter Piezo
expression in cartilage and if this increased expression translates to increased chondrocyte sensitivity to
mechanical loads. This study hones in on key dysregulated adipokines with obesity: IL-1α, Leptin, tumor necrosis
factor alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Specific Aim 2 uses transgenic mice previously developed in the
lab to investigate if the loss of chondrocyte-specific Piezo1 and/or Piezo2 ion channels protects against cartilage
damage in an in vivo model of obesity and joint injury. Specifically, mice will be fed a high-fat diet (60% fat) and
subjected to a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery, known to evoke post-traumatic OA.
Together, both aims strategically develop atomic force microscopy (AFM) and calcium (Ca2+) imaging techniques
with in vivo assessments of cartilage integrity to complement the use of genetically-modified mice in a model of
HFD superimposed with DMM injury. The results from this study will help identify the mechanisms by which
obesity affects cartilage health, ultimately leading to the development of OA disease modifying drugs, that may
be more broadly applied to other tissues affected by altered mechanosensation of Piezo ion channels."

This proposal details a five-year research career development plan centered on the development of a platform
for the targeted delivery of immunosuppressive agents (ISAs) for crescentic glomerulonephritis (CGN) to the
kidney-draining lymph node (KLN), which can increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of the current
standard therapy for this condition. The candidate is an Instructor in the Department of Medicine at Harvard
Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Renal Medicine at Brigham and Women's
Hospital (BWH). This proposal details a clear path to independence for the candidate through the guidance of
a multi-disciplinary group of scientists with complementary expertise and exemplary records of mentorship: (1)
Reza Abdi (Mentor), an NIH-funded transplant nephrologist at BWH who holds 2 R01 grants, (2) David Salant
(Advisor), a world-renowned physician-investigator in glomerular disease at Boston University, (3) Ulrich von
Andrian (Advisor), a preeminent lymph node immunologist at HMS, and (4) Jeffrey Karp (Advisor), an engineer
at HMS and BWH who conducts pioneering research in drug delivery. This guidance will be bolstered by
pursuit of coursework and acquisition of laboratory skills that are tailored to the candidate's career goals and
crucial for his successful transition to independence as a physician-scientist in the field of renal immunology.
The standard treatment for CGN, a rapidly progressive inflammatory condition that can lead to kidney failure
within days, involves the use of potent systemic ISAs that can cause severe side effects that may result in
death. Therefore, a pressing unmet clinical need exists for targeted immunosuppressive therapy for CGN, but
this remains an underexplored field of research. Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are resident stromal cells of
the lymph node (LN) that contribute actively to the propagation of an adaptive immune response. Preliminary
data from a first-author study published by the candidate indicates that the activity of FRCs in the KLN is
crucial to the propagation of the cell-mediated immune response in a mouse model of CGN known as
nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTN). In addition, the candidate's laboratory has synthesized a MECA79
antibody-conjugated polymeric nanoparticle (MECA79-NP) that localizes specifically to the KLN during NTN.
The main objective of this proposal is to determine how the activation of FRCs promotes a pro-inflammatory
milieu in the KLN during CGN in order to identify new targets for a novel therapeutic strategy to combat CGN.
The aims of this proposal are to (1) explore the mechanism governing the adoption of a pro-inflammatory
phenotype by FRCs in the KLN during CGN, (2) investigate the role of FRCs in the expansion of the lymphatic
vasculature within the KLN during CGN, and (3) develop a first-in-class nanotherapeutic agent that delivers
ISAs to the KLN to suppress CGN effectively. The results from these studies could assist in solving the urgent
clinical need for precision medicine in the treatment of CGN."

 Secreted and cell-surface-localized Immunoglobulin Superfamily proteins (‘extracellular IgSFs’) are
important class of proteins, which includes proven targets for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer.
The human proteome contains ~500 extracellular IgSFs, the largest superfamily of cell surface molecules that
contribute to the regulation of innate and adaptive immunity, via specific IgSF:IgSF interactions at the ‘Immune
Synapse” formed between antigen-presenting cells and T-cells.
 Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular basis of interactions in the immune synapse. This
requires the mapping of receptor-ligand interactions among the vast number of un-annotated IgSFs, and to gain
insight about the specificity of these interactions. Subsequently, we plan to leverage our newly-gained insights
into redesigning protein interfaces for specificity, both in order to generate new reagents that in turn can further
interrogate the regulatory mechanisms within the immune synapse, and to establish potential new drug leads
that can rationally modulate the immune response in diseases.
 In this application we will further develop our protein design-aided pharmacophore approach, ProtLID
and utilize it for identifying cognate partners in the immune synapse, and for designing specific interfaces. We
will also explore to synergisticly combine computational and experimental protein engineering techniques. We
will develop an interdisciplinary approach where computationally designed, residue-based pharmacophore
descriptions of the receptor-ligand interface are used to direct the library design in subsequent phage display
experiments, allowing for the effective exploration of engineered constructs. All our computational results will
be followed up with in vitro biochemical and cell-based experimental validation.
 These studies will directly expand the current knowledgebase of receptor-ligand pairs in the immune
synapse and yield mutant molecules, with altered affinities and selectivities for therapeutic applications."

Research during the early years of medical education trains medical students in quantitative reasoning, and
scientific literacy as well as expose them to mentors who have devoted their careers to investigation. It thus
sharpens their understanding of the processes by which the practice of medicine develops and improves as
well as stimulating their interests in research careers. The curriculum at the Vagelos College of Physicians and
Surgeons of Columbia University now requires that all medical students produce a “Scholarly Effort” before
graduation expanding our pool of applicants. Research in basic and clinical aspects of Diabetes,
Endocrinology, Obesity, Kidney, Urology and Digestive Diseases is particularly strong at our medical school
with 60 investigators having current RO1 grants. Over the past 4 years, 70 of our students applied each year to
enter the T35 training program. While we had initially asked for an annual support of 12 students, there were
many more qualified applicants and through re-budgeting of our non-training funds we were able to fund 51
students working in these areas (~13/year). The students attended weekly seminars in important topics
including career development and the responsible conduct of research. In addition, we hosted a weekly journal
club specific for NIDDK trainees where mentors discussed their current research using their publications in
high impact journals. We acted as a regional center for medical student research in NIDDK funded fields
recruiting 5 additional students who worked with our mentors. The outcomes have exceeded our expectations,
since its inception in 2012, 14 of our students over this short period decided to dedicate an additional year of
research to their projects; 39 of them published 90 peer-reviewed papers, 18 as first authors, and most
presented their work at local, national or international meetings. The Program will be supervised by a
recruitment and admission committee that will choose the students from the applicant pool, a committee that
follows their progress and an internal advisory committee that helps the PI/PD in running the program. Finally,
a career development committee will aid the students in making important career decision as they progress
through medical school as well as evaluate the program. We are starting a new collaboration with the City
University of New York where the majority of medical students are from under-represented minorities. We hope
this new effort will provide a “pipeline” of such students into our program."

(NIDDK) research community to the growing number of biomedical resources (e.g., organisms, reagents,
materials, protocols), data, and bioinformatics tools available to them through the multiple programs and centers
established by NIDDK and the broader scientific community. dkNET has seen steady growth over the last project
period and achieved significant success toward our mission, highlighted by 4 main areas of impact: 1) provided
a novel Resource Information Network (RIN) that connects the NIDDK research community to the expanding
universe of biomedical resources and data; 2) significantly improved the rigor and reproducibility of published
research through its leadership in creating and promoting adoption of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs);
3) increased computational skills among the NIDDK workforce through educational programs, the dkNET
Bioinformatics Pilot program, the Hypothesis Center, and the D-Challenge; and 4) brought FAIR (Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Re-usable) data principles to DK researchers through educational materials, a
webinar series, and the Summer of Data student program. dkNET tools, resources, and training materials assist
researchers throughout the experimental process from hypothesis generation to supporting sound and
reproducible science. Building on the success of dkNET (Resource Core) we will extend its services to the
community through a new Computational Core that will bring powerful new AI/ML techniques and cloud
computing resources to the NIDDK research community to fully leverage data assets cataloged by dkNET to
explore and develop hypotheses. Our objective is to create a unified ML paradigm for performing a diverse range
of analytical tasks. This paradigm will have the ability to process the various data types cataloged by dkNET;
integrate data of multiple modalities from different sources; and incorporate domain-specific knowledge from
public knowledge bases. The resulting knowledge model from this paradigm will facilitate hypothesis validation

10823278,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), (PWH), are at increased
risk of frailty, which increases the risk of adverse age-related outcomes, including falls, hospitalization and
mortality. The mechanisms of frailty are not completely understood, particularly among PWH. The objectives of
this proposal are to study the extent to which free testosterone and sex hormone binging globulin (SHBG)
concentrations are associated with frailty and inflammation in men with HIV. We hypothesize that free
testosterone and SHBG are key biomarkers for identifying PWH at the highest risk of frailty and who may
benefit from intervention with anabolic agents. Our specific aims are to: 1) Determine the association of
circulating free testosterone and SHBG with incident frailty using state-of-the-art hormone measurements among
men with HIV, 2) Determine the association of diurnal variation in free testosterone with HIV serostatus in men
and its association with systemic inflammation, 3) Determine the association of novel SHBG glycans with frailty
among men with HIV.
In Aim 1, we will measure serum free testosterone with state-of-the-art methods and SHBG in men with HIV
who are part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), an ongoing prospective study since 1984 studying
the natural and treated histories of HIV-1 infection in homosexual and bisexual men. We will determine the
associations of these hormones with incident frailty, collected at semi-annual visits since 2007.
In Aim 2, we will select men with and without HIV that have collected blood samples in AM and PM to assess
diurnal variation in free testosterone and systemic inflammation [Interleukin 6 (IL6) and soluble TNF-alpha
receptors II (sTNFRII)].
In Aim 3, we will study novel SHBG glycoforms in men with HIV, the identification and quantification of SHBG
glycoforms will be performed by capillary electrophoresis and lectin microarray. The proposed research aims to
provide new insights to the contribution of free testosterone and SHBG in frailty and its relationship with systemic
inflammation. The goals during the award period include gaining advanced expertise in biostatistical methods,
design and conduct epidemiological studies, as well as hands-on experience in the measurement of glycoforms
from plasma proteins and interpretation of glycomic data through mentored research, tailored didactic
coursework, and supervised performance of relevant laboratory techniques. Long-term goals include developing
a career as an independent investigator in translational epidemiology and developing new approaches to treating
and preventing age-related outcomes such as frailty in PWH."
10808128,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
This proposal is devoted to the development, clinical implementation and evaluation of a novel, methodology
for generating brain sodium images of unparalleled resolution and signal-to-noise-ratio. This methodology is a
result or recent developments in Bayesian image reconstruction and manifold mapping techniques that
together make it possible to robustly utilize anatomical information from high-resolution brain scans to guide
the reduction of partial voluming effects from lower resolution, lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) brain scans.
Though such “constrained reconstruction” schemes have been long-advocated in the MRI imaging community,
their computational demands, limited performance and heavy operator input had previously limited their
evaluation and practical characterization thus rendering them impractical for use within the confines of a
clinical environment. Recently, we have shown that the combined use of segmentation free Bayesian
approaches together with manifold mapping techniques can be used to provide a fast framework for
Anatomically Guided Reconstruction where the information form high-resolution brain scans is used, routinely,
to improve spatial resolution and SNR of concurrently acquired brain PET scans leading to improved sensitivity
for the detection of low-contrast lesions in the brain. Our initial experience with extensions of this approach for
sodium MRI of the brain has produced images of spatial resolution and SNR that far exceed what had been
previously achieved using high and ultra-high magnetic field strengths. Establishing the limits of this approach
and characterizing its performance on clinically relevant cases is the thrust of this proposal."

Older Black Americans have higher rates of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than their
White counterparts, a disparity that is greater for Black women. Given the lack of effective therapies to slow
disease progression and symptoms, effective prevention is needed. Most knowledge of risk factors for
cognitive decline, the hallmark feature of AD, comes from studies of White populations and the contribution of
racially/socially-patterned risk factors among Black adults remains under-studied. We propose to study 2,500
Black women ages 55 and older from the Black Women’s Health Study (BWHS), a follow-up study of 59,000
Black women from across the US. Our goal is to identify social factors that, together with biomarkers of AD,
influence cognitive decline. The BWHS provides a unique opportunity to accomplish this goal. Over 27 years,
the BWHS has collected data through biennial questionnaires from participants on socioeconomic,
psychological, and physical stressors occurring at various times of life (e.g., low parental education, childhood
sexual/physical abuse, interpersonal racism), as well as information on many potential risk factors for AD and
cognitive decline (e.g., demographics, body size, behavioral factors (e.g., exercise, diet, smoking), medical
history, reproductive history, medication use, health care). The BWHS has collected and stored blood from a
large subsample of participants who agreed to wide sharing, such as GWAS results with other investigators
and public databases. After enrollment of 2,500 such participants with already-collected blood samples from
the BWHS, we propose to administer a validated telephone cognitive battery annually to measure cognition.
We will also measure a panel of AT(N) plasma biomarkers and conduct GWAS in order to examine the
associations of plasma biomarkers and genetic variants with cognitive decline. Based on the collected data
and the results from biomarker assessments, we will assess the joint effects of the stressors and biomarkers
on cognitive decline. A feasibility study demonstrated the willingness of BWHS participants to complete the
cognitive test battery over the telephone and indicated that enough BWHS participants will participate to reach
a study size of ~2,500 participants. The investigators have the experience and expertise to enroll participants;
measure cognition with a validated telephone cognitive battery; measure AT(N) biomarkers in stored plasma
and conduct GWAS; and with these data, to assess their separate and joint effects on cognitive decline. The
proposed study provides an unparalleled opportunity to leverage a large national sample of older Black women
on which comprehensive data on many factors that affect cognition have been collected to identify life-course
risk factors for cognitive decline. The findings will have important translational implications for efforts to prevent
cognitive decline in all populations, but especially in Black women who are disproportionately burdened."
10932997,"Osteoarthritis (OA) affects an estimated 32.5 million US adults and up to 50% of those aged over 65; over 80%
of this burden is attributable to knee OA. Pain is consistently identified as the most troublesome symptom for
people living with knee OA, with higher pain intensity associated with reduced muscle strength, activity
limitations, and reduced quality of life. Exercise is central in clinical practice guidelines for knee OA pain
management; however, evidence synthesis has demonstrated variable and, overall, modest effects.
Observational studies have indicated that the pain-relieving effects of exercise may be modulated by sleep
disturbances, including symptoms of insomnia, thus providing one possible explanation for the variable effect
of exercise on OA pain reduction. This information is especially critical given that an estimated 70% of older
adults with knee OA report having problems with sleep. This study is based on the premise that improving
sleep may improve the pain-relieving benefits of exercise for knee OA. Informed by existing evidence and
focus groups conducted with people living with OA and sleep disturbances, we developed and subsequently
feasibility-tested a hybrid exercise and sleep improvement intervention for OA pain management (Move and
Snooze). The intervention combines a personalized exercise program with an automated and digitally
delivered evidence-based course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). The primary aim of
this clinical trial is to determine the effectiveness of the eight-week hybrid program on knee OA pain reduction.
Participants will be randomized to receive the hybrid intervention (personalized exercise program + CBT-I) or
the personalized exercise program alone. In addition to determining effectiveness, we will investigate whether
specific characteristics identify individuals who derive particular benefit from the hybrid intervention.
Specifically, we will determine whether insomnia symptoms need to exceed a specific threshold for provision of
the sleep-enhanced exercise program to be warranted and will examine whether the intervention is more
effective for people presenting with indication of centralized pain (as opposed to predominantly peripheral
pain). We will also determine whether pre-specified psychological factors (e.g., symptoms of depression and
anxiety) alter the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, as we will collect data on hypothesized possible
mediators of the intervention throughout the course of the trial (e.g., pain vigilance and awareness; positive
and negative affect; fatigue intensity), we will apply contemporary causal inference methods to determine
pathways by which the hybrid intervention, and exercise alone, exert their effects on changes in pain. This
research will generate evidence to advance osteoarthritis pain management towards greater efficacy and
personalization, serving our long-term goal of improving pain outcomes for the vast and growing number of
people living with OA by identifying the most appropriate behavior change interventions for specific patient
phenotypes."

This application is focused on probing how post-translational modifications (PTMs) contribute to the DNA
damage response (DDR), a vital process for the maintenance of genomic integrity. The long-term goal is a basic
mechanistic understanding of DNA damage repair that will facilitate the development of new therapeutic
strategies to combat cancer. In this context, the proposed overall objective is to elucidate how the tumor
suppressor E3 ubiquitin ligase BRCA1-BARD1 and DDR protein 53BP1 regulate the cell cycle dependency of
DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway selection. BRCA1-BARD1 promotes DSB repair by homologous
recombination (HR) during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle whereas 53BP1 inactivates HR and promotes
repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) mostly in G1 phase. Imbalance between HR and NHEJ—for
example linked to mutations in BRCA1-BARD1—can result in chromosomal rearrangements that drive
oncogenesis. BRCA1-BARD1 and 53BP1 can recognize a similar DSB-dependent PTM, the ubiquitylation of
histone H2A at K15 in the nucleosome, the basic subunit of chromatin, suggesting that competition for chromatin
association in response to DNA damage could account, at least in part, for the antagonistic activities of BRCA1-
BARD1 and 53BP1 with respect to HR. The central hypothesis to be tested is that BRCA1-BARD1, through its
ubiquitin ligase activity on the nucleosome, indirectly leads to 53BP1 displacement from damaged chromatin and
directly prevents the establishment in newly replicated chromatin of a PTM (i.e., dimethylation of histone H4 K20)
required for the chromatin recruitment of 53BP1. The rationale for this work is that it will provide fundamental
knowledge about the mechanisms of action of BRCA1-BARD1 and 53BP1. Such knowledge is important for
understanding how DSBs are repaired with implications for cancer prevention and the development of new
therapies. Two specific aims will be pursued to test the central hypothesis. Aim 1: Probe how BRCA1-BARD1
associates with and modifies chromatin in response to DNA damage. Aim 2: Probe how 53BP1 associates with
chromatin and is antagonized by BRCA1-BARD1. In both aims, structural biology approaches will be integrated
to characterize BRCA1-BARD1, 53BP1 and a chromatin remodeler that may connect BRCA1-BARD1 and
53BP1 functionally. The structures will inform functional in vitro studies and collaborative cell biology to reveal
the chromatin recruitment mechanisms of BRCA1-BARD1 and 53BP1. The proposed research is significant
because it is expected to explain how BRCA1-BARD1 opposes the chromatin recruitment and retention of 53BP1
to promote HR DSB repair post-replication. This work will therefore explain how BRCA1-BARD1 and 53BP1
regulate DSB repair pathway selection in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Knowledge gained from this research
is expected to stimulate the long-term development of new therapies to treat cancer."
10797316,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Even the largest lung cancer screening trial to date, the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) is
insufficient on its own to answer questions about the effectiveness of lung cancer screening in diverse clinical
settings. Findings from the NLST may not generalize to new populations due to the highly selected trial
population, higher levels of adherence, and screening strategies that do not reflect current practice. Claims
datasets, screening registries, and prospective studies offer opportunities for evaluating lung cancer screening
strategies in real-world populations, but current methods that attempt to integrate this evidence are insufficient.
Standard meta-analyses and simulation models use information from multiple trials and studies, but produce
estimates that do not have a clear causal interpretation for any target population. The proposed project will
bridge the gap between the available data and policy relevant questions by combining diverse information and
developing new methods to estimate screening strategies that have a causal interpretation in nationally
representative target populations. Our long-term objective is to reduce lung cancer mortality by combining
multi-source data to learn about optimal lung cancer screening strategies in real-world populations. We will
take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Use information from diverse
sources to transport the effect of lung cancer screening strategies from trials to nationally representative target
populations; (2) Identify individuals in nationally representative target populations who are most likely to benefit
from lung cancer screening, including individuals traditionally underrepresented in trials, by jointly evaluating
effect heterogeneity over multiple characteristics; (3) Model adherence patterns to lung cancer screening
strategies in real-world settings and use these models to assess the effects of lung cancer screening strategies
under different levels of adherence in nationally representative target populations; (4) Estimate in nationally
representative target populations the comparative effectiveness of lung cancer screening strategies when the
strategies have not been directly compared in the same trial but have been evaluated in different trials against
a common comparator; (5) Use information from diverse sources as inputs in a simulation model to compare
screening strategies that differ from those used in trials, in nationally representative target populations. This
project will provide new insights on the comparative effectiveness of lung cancer screening strategies. Training
in cancer prevention and statistical skills will launch my career as an independent researcher in data science
and epidemiology that develops causal, statistical, and simulation methods to produce evidence that will lead
to improved decision-making for cancer control strategies."

The Western NC Stroke Net Regional Coordinating Center (RCC) has been a high-performing site since 2018, with 206 participants enrolled (as of 1/17/23) in 12 of 13 ongoing trials, 85% retention of diverse participants (28% African American, 2.5% American Indian/Alaska Native), and trials that were launched quickly (average 105 days from activation to first subject randomized, shortest time 7 days). We are a top enroller for MOST (20), SATURN (11), and ASPIRE (7). Our Career Enhancement and Training Program has successfully trained 3 academically productive fellows, with 11 publications, 32 presentations at scientific meetings, and recognition by the NCC Education Core. In 2020, Wake Forest Baptist merged with Atrium Health, and in 2022, Advocate Aurora merged with Atrium to become the 2nd largest health system in the US with a medical school (WFUSM is the academic core). With expansion of our network, we are now the Wake Forest Stroke Net. The clinical performance sites for this renewal include Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist (RCC), Novant Forsyth Medical Center, Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center (Charlotte), Carolinas Rehab (Charlotte), Eastern Carolina University (Greenville, NC), Novant New Hanover Regional Medical Center (Wilmington, NC), Advocate Christ Hospital (Chicago), and Aurora St. Luke's Medical Center (Milwaukee). Our catchment includes the majority of NC including the Stroke Buckle, much of the Stroke Belt (SC, GA, AL), and urban cities in WI and IL (over 6,500 stroke patients discharged in 2022), covering populations from diverse socioeconomic, urban and rural geographies, typically under-represented in clinical trials. Wake Forest investigators have designed and conducted first-in-human, phase II, III, pragmatic, and comparative effectiveness trials. We have diverse, experienced stroke leadership at the RCC, with Dr. Bushnell (neurology) and Dr. Wolfe (vascular neurosurgery) as MPIs, and Drs. Ranasinghe and Baldwin (both Neurology) as co-Is, as well as a seasoned Stroke Net project manager, Krystal Schmidt, who will assist the partnering sites with trial selection, startup, and operations to meet the goals of efficiency and enrollment with Stroke Net clinical trials. We have partnered with a successful community outreach program (Triad Pastor's Network) and added a Patient and Participant Advisory Board that will review protocols, consents, and trial performance. Our goal is to be the leading SN RCC enrolling primarily in the Southeast US, with diverse stroke patients into SN trials, bringing important scientific discoveries to the SN network. We will achieve the following: AIM 1: To continue and expand successful enrollment and retention of participants in Stroke Net trials from our geographically, ethnically, economically, and historically underserved diverse catchment areas. AIM 2: To collaborate with our interdisciplinary team to design and propose new Stroke Net treatment, prevention, recovery trials. AIM 3: To continue to train the next generation of diverse stroke clinical trialists and researchers.

10798046,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 1 in 16 individuals over age 40 (approximately 10 million Americans) [2].
The end stage of lower-extremity PAD, critical limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI), is estimated to affect 1.3% of
those over age 40 (approximately 2 million Americans) [3]. Left untreated, up to 40% of patients with CLTI will
require major (above the ankle) amputation within 6 months [4].
CLTI is often associated with multivessel below-the-knee (BTK) arterial occlusion, necessitating surgical bypass
or endovascular intervention to restore blood flow. Endovascular (catheter-based) procedures, which are likely
to occur in approximately 220,000 cases in the U.S. in 2025 [5], are often preferred over surgery in CLTI patients
due to high-surgical-risk comorbidities, but they have historically produced suboptimal results. Failure of the first
intervention is typically 50% or greater in the first year. After that initial failure and over the 5-year period following
reintervention, patients often progress toward a need for multiple re-interventions, major amputation in more than
half of patients, and 5-year survival rates less than 40% (as in a recent study of 1,134 patients with average age
of 59 years) [6]. Drug-coated balloons and drug-eluting stents have invariably had negative clinical trial results
for reducing restenosis below the knee, possibly because significant disease in these smaller vessels may be
hindering drug elution kinetics from the solid-drug elution devices.
Meanwhile, adventitial and perivascular delivery of liquid formulations have proven quite effective. The TANGO
trial, an FDA Phase 2, dual-blinded, randomized, controlled trial of temsirolimus injected with Mercator’s
Bullfrog® Micro-Infusion Device was funded in part by the prior Phase II SBIR grant. TANGO was performed to
determine safety and efficacy endpoints and strength of signal in the improvement in treating BTK arterial
occlusion. The rate of clinically relevant target lesion failure after treatment was reduced by a relative 51.3% in
comparison to controls. Based on this signal, the Phase 3 trial has been designed and negotiated with FDA.
The proposed research aims include the finalization of development and production of a research batch of
lyophilized temsirolimus and its corresponding placebo under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP),
completing the negotiation of a special protocol assessment (SPA) with the FDA, and carrying out the Phase 3
clinical trial up to its interim analysis. Beyond the scope and timeframe of this grant, the Phase 3 trial will be
completed, with meaningful clinical endpoints to achieve NDA approval from FDA and a J-code for drug
reimbursement from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
The significance of this proposal lies in the fact that (a) a recalcitrant clinical problem is being addressed, (b)
perivascular or adventitial therapy may be used as an adjunct to several common interventional revascularization
techniques and (c) therapeutic success in BTK PAD could be translated into ATK applications soon thereafter.
With the success of this Phase 3 trial, FDA approval for the novel combination therapy will be sought."
10797552,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Mutations in the human genome give rise to many human diseases including cancer. Mutations are also
beneficial for processes including evolution and adaptive immunity. However, little is known about the
molecular basis of mutagenesis. One mechanism that leads to the introduction of mutations is
misincorporation of nucleotides by DNA polymerases during DNA replication and repair. The focus of our
application is on deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) substrate selection by DNA polymerase beta (Pol β).
Pol β functions in base excision repair, a process that has evolved to repair oxidative DNA damage. These
types of damage are generated by a cell’s endogenous metabolism as well as exogenous sources such as
ionizing radiation, UV light, and chemotherapeutic agents. During base excision repair, 20,000-50,000
predominantly oxidative DNA lesions are enzymatically removed, leaving small gaps in the DNA that are filled
in by Pol β. Incorrect substrate selection by Pol β during base excision repair has potential to result in genomic
instability. We have recently shown that Pol β also functions in DNA gap filling during microhomology-mediated
end-joining in VDJ recombination, where it plays an important role in generating immune diversity.
 Our broad, long-term objective is to understand how DNA polymerases choose the correct substrate for
incorporation into DNA. Pol β is an excellent model for studying polymerase mechanisms because of its
relatively small size and the ease of purifying protein and growing crystals. The aims of this application are to
understand how Pol β selects the correct dNTP and why it sometimes chooses the incorrect dNTP for
incorporation into DNA. We will employ a powerful combination of biochemical, structural, biophysical,
computational and biological approaches in this multi-investigator project. We will determine how Pol β selects
the correct substrate for incorporation into DNA and how the mechanisms differ for mutator variants of Pol β.
Our research will result in the characterization of the roles of amino acid residues in the selection of substrates
during Pol β catalysis. Our findings will be of fundamental importance in understanding the molecular basis of
substrate selection by Pol β that will likely have broad applicability to other DNA polymerases."

The University of New Mexico and University of Colorado will serve as academic hubs for the SSA-RCC with multiple outreach sites in New Mexico, West Texas, and Colorado. The SSA-RCC will work to increase the recruitment of underrepresented minority populations in stroke clinical trials through targeted outreach and education efforts, culturally sensitive recruitment and retention protocols, partnerships with healthcare providers and community organizations, and training and support for junior faculty, fellows, and research coordinators. The network will also share best practices and resources with other members of the national research network and develop and promote standards for the recruitment of special populations in stroke clinical trials. The SSA-RCC will leverage and consolidate its existing infrastructure, established collaborations, and experience in conducting stroke clinical research and in the recovery and rehabilitation setting to achieve its specific aims. The Principal Investigator and Co-Investigators are committed to partnering with Stroke Net and other RCCs to offer every eligible patient the opportunity to participate in a trial conducted by the network with a focus on the recruitment of special populations. The SSA-RCC aims to improve stroke clinical trial recruitment and retention and accelerate the translation of stroke therapeutics from bench to bedside, ultimately improving stroke prevention, treatment, and recovery for all patients."
10797669,"The objective of this application is to develop advanced multiview (MV) deconvolution tomography of cleared
tissue using high resolution two photon microscopy (TPM) and utilize it to shed new mechanistic insights about
the myofibroblast microenvironment in fibrovascular peritendinous adhesions. Advances to our understanding of
the cellular and molecular events involved in tendon adhesion using transgenic mouse models, which could lead
to disease modifying therapies, are often hindered by reliance on 2D histology sections and single-cell analysis
techniques, neither of which can put cellular interactions or molecular processes into their 3D spatial context.
Alternatively, microscopy techniques such as TPM and light sheet microscopy (LSM) can provide spatial context,
but struggle to simultaneously provide the throughput, contrast and resolution required to map the cellular
processes involved in tissue healing over physiologically relevant spatial and resolution scales and so are not
widely used in tendon biology. To overcome these limitations, we have developed protocols for immunolabeling
and tissue clearing of tendon injury models and demonstrated molecular and second harmonic generation
(SHG) imaging of tendon in situ. Our proposed advances in detection electronics and imaging enable two
photon microscopy two orders of magnitude faster than conventional microscopes and multicolor imaging
at rates comparable to or exceeding LSM. Finally, we propose a novel approach to MV deconvolution, which
simultaneously acquires multiple angular views to decrease focal volumes by an order of magnitude, enabling
isotropic resolution tomographic imaging of tissues. We combine these technical advances into a high
throughput platform for 3D spatial immunophenotyping and proteomics and then apply it to understanding the
complex mosaic of vascular and inflammatory cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), and signaling (TGF-
β1/mTOR) in the myofibroblast microenvironment, to shed new mechanistic insights that could lead to discovery
of cellular and molecular targets for biologic therapies. The aims for this proposal are: Aim 1 will develop a new
approach to tomography using MVD based on simultaneously imaging two angular views that will accelerate
imaging and reduce the extreme computational complexity required to fuse two sequentially acquired volumes
together. Eight channel acquisition will enable dense spectral multiplexing of probes and a deconvolution,
enabling efficient quantification of spatial relationships between reporters at sub-wavelength scale. Aim 2 will
apply MV-TPM to tomographically profile the myofibroblast microenvironment to build spatial cellular interaction
networks of innate and adaptive immune cells within the vascular inflammatory microenvironment of
myofibroblasts. Aim 3 will utilize MV-TPM imaging to map TGF-β1/mTOR signaling in the myofibroblast
microenvironment and subsequently inhibit it to validate its role in adhesions. When completed, the proposed
work will develop a high throughput 3D spatial immunophenotyping and proteomics imaging platform to shed
novel mechanistic insights and discover new biologic therapies."

The integration of brain, breathing and the heart is vital to meet the continuously changing metabolic and
behavioral demands of an organism. Consequently, disorders of breathing are rarely limited to breathing
disturbances and typically also include disturbances in cardiorespiratory coupling and arousal. Failure to arouse
can lead to SIDS, while the ability to gasp and arouse is a reliable predictor for a positive long-term outcome
after cardiac arrest. On the other hand, frequent arousals in obstructive sleep apnea result in sleep disturbances.
However, understanding, how the neuronal control of breathing is integrated within the wider nervous system to
control arousal and autonomic motor outputs has been challenging since this requires a broader understanding
of respiratory rhythmogenesis, cardiorespiratory coupling and the ascending and descending control of the
arousal network. This grant will use cutting-edge molecular, genomic and systems level approaches to obtain a
detailed understanding of the connectomes that integrate the respiratory network with the arousal network. The
recently developed Neuropixel approach enabled us to record from thousands of neurons across the CNS which
includes the ventral respiratory column (VRC). Recordings obtained in urethane anesthetized freely breathing
mice reveal that the activity of expiratory and inspiratory neurons along the entire VRC gives rise to rotational
population dynamics which gradually transitions from expiration into inspiration before the respiratory cycle
terminates in the inspiration off-switch. Since expiratory activity is largely absent in isolated in vitro preparations,
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the generation of expiratory activity in vivo requires afferent input from the
lungs. We will explore how mechanosensory input controls eupneic breathing by combining lung inflations with
optogenetic stimulations of neurons located in the VRC and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). Aim 2 will explore
the reconfiguration of the respiratory network as it transitions from eupnea into gasping. Due to a loss of
expiratory activity, the respiratory network dynamically extends rostrally to generate inspiratory-phased VRC
population activity. We hypothesize that this spatial extension recruits the arousal network. Aim 3 studies the
gasping-induced activation of the arousal network and the effects of vagal stimulations in alert and behaving
animals to test the hypothesis that the arousal network is reciprocally connected with a network that decreases
anxiety. Neuropixel recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the Locus coeruleus (LC), parabrachial
complex (PB) and basal forebrain (BF) will be combined with targeted opto- and chemogenetic approaches to
gain first insights into the emotional control of breathing."
10798777,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the cause for the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection.
Commonly referred to as a silent epidemic, C. trachomatis infections in women frequently manifest with
subclinical inflammation, and therefore often go unnoticed and untreated. The infection can persist for
months or years and ultimately cause pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and infertility. In
order to establish persistent infections, C. trachomatis must subvert both the innate and the adaptive
branches of the immune system. A central node that connects adaptive and innate immunity to
C. trachomatis is the cytokine gamma-interferon (IFN). This cytokine is produced by innate (ILCs) and
adaptive lymphocytes (T cells) and induces cell-autonomous immunity against Chlamydia in epithelial cells.
To overcome IFN-mediated immunity and replicate inside human epithelial cells, C. trachomatis evolved
counter-defenses specifically adapted to its human host. These C. trachomatis counter-defenses and the
corresponding repertoire of IFN-inducible anti-Chlamydia defense programs are poorly characterized. Our
goal is to decipher this antagonistic interplay between IFN-mediated host defense and chlamydial counter-
defense. We perform unbiased functional genomics screens to identify human IFN-inducible genes (ISGs)
that exert potent anti-Chlamydia defenses. In parallel we employ defined C. trachomatis mutant libraries in
functional bacterial genetic screens to identify C. trachomatis genes that subvert ISG-driven defense
pathways. Taking these approaches, we identified the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF213 as a human ISG that
eliminates non-human-adapted Chlamydia from human cells through a novel and uncharacterized innate
immune pathway. Reciprocally, we identified the secreted C. trachomatis virulence factor GarD as an
RNF213 antagonist protecting C. trachomatis from RNF213-driven cell-autonomous immunity in human
cells. The mechanism by which this newly discovered RNF213-mediated cell-autonomous defense program
eliminates vacuolar pathogens such as C. trachomatis garD mutant is unknown and will be interrogated
through multidisciplinary approaches in this proposal. Complementary to these studies dissecting RNF213’s
host defense function, we will identify and characterize additional RNF213-independent human cell-
autonomous immune programs directed at Chlamydia and the corresponding counter-immune strategies
employed by C. trachomatis. Using organoid and traditional human cell culture systems as well as novel in
vivo mouse models, we will interrogate the importance of these antagonist host-pathogen relationships in
immune clearance and immunopathology of Chlamydia infections. Such novel insights may guide the
development of new therapeutic or prophylactic treatments or vaccine designs."

Human dyadic social communication entails a rich repertoire of expression, including not only face expression
(and gaze), but also acoustics (prosody and pauses) turn-taking, gestures and language. Communication has
evolved in humans within a social context, beginning with the parent-infant dyad, with mirroring of facial
expressions and sounds. Its natural ecology is face-to-face dyadic interactions, both in-person and increasingly
via remote platforms for teleconferencing and telehealth. Social communication is a “complex orchestration” in
real time: its signals are multiple and temporally offset. It is a continuous exchange that is highly coordinated
between speakers, with norms for turn-taking and alignment of face expression, gesture, semantic content and
speech rates. As yet, a critical gap exists in that we lack the tools to quantify and analyze temporal patterns of
multimodal communication behavior between two individuals in face-to-face communication, in an ecologically
valid setting, that have the same rigor and reproducibility as do hyperscanning approaches to record brain activity
during dyadic conversation. This tool must be developed to realize the true potential of second-person
neuroscience. This planning proposal for tool development entails several key activities, beginning with the
convening of a diverse multidisciplinary team of experts from various fields, including ethics/regulatory,
anthropology, cognitive neuroscience, computer science, engineering, physics, mathematics, psychiatry and
neurology. This team will discuss ethics, diversity, paradigm development, and computational frameworks, and
providing iterative feedback and convening also with advocacy groups. Also, we will build two testing rooms for
multimodal recording of dyadic communication, to demonstrate feasibility of acquiring and synching high
temporal resolution data. Pilot EEG hyperscanning will be done concurrently in a subcohort. Further, given
increased use of teleconferencing, dyadic communication data will be collected via remote platform and
compared with in-person data, to determine how information may be degraded by differences in resolution and
streaming delays. We will also develop computational frameworks for analyses of multimodal data."
10798621,"Vascular cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is the second leading cause of dementia and is frequently found in association with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias. Recent studies in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients who survive show an alarming rate of progression to dementia, within only a few months of injury- even in young people. The mechanisms for this rapid progression to dementia are unknown. Receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)-1 is a serine/threonine kinase that promotes cognitive deficits in models of dementia and neurodegeneration. In a collagenase ICH model, RIPK1 was activated in cerebral endothelium in the chronic period, and RIPK1 kinase dead mice were completely protected against chronic blood-brain barrier damage, a major mechanism of ADRD and VCID. These observations suggest that RIPK1 is a potential cause of VCID in ICH patients. ICH induces well characterized mechanisms of cognitive dysfunction, including (1) increased levels of phospho-eif2 alpha consistent with an integrated stress response, (2) increased production of processed IL-1 beta in neurons, and (3) persistent BBB damage at 35 days, that are exquisitely dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity. Strikingly, kinase dead RIPK1D138N/D138N → WT bone marrow chimeras were protected against ICH-induced cognitive deficits, supporting a role for RIPK1 in hematopoietic cells, whereas brain RIPK1 drove persistent BBB damage. We hypothesize that RIPK1 causes VCID after ICH via hematopoietic cells which induce activation of the integrated stress response and NLRP1 inflammasome in neurons and endothelium, and via brain endothelium by driving persistent BBB damage. To test these hypotheses, we propose three Specific Aims: Aim 1: Define peripheral mechanisms of early RIPK1-dependent responses to ICH via immune cell activation. Aim 2: Identify brain cell types that mediate RIPK1 kinase-dependent motor, cognitive, and BBB dysfunction after ICH. Aim 3: Define cell-specific mechanisms by which RIPK1 promotes persistent cognitive and blood-brain barrier dysfunction after ICH. Use of novel cell specific inducible RIPK1 kinase dead mice will allow us to test whether RIPK1 inhibition long after ICH can rescue cognitive deficits and BBB damage. Successful completion of the Aims is expected to provide scientific justification for clinical trials using RIPK1 kinase inhibitors in patients in the chronic period of ICH."

Infections, both bacterial and viral, have been linked to pediatric hydrocephalus and can impact the nascent
brain’s developmental programs. In fetal development, stem cells line the ventricles and provide neurons and
glia required for brain development; ventricle-contacting stem cells also generate a protective epithelial
monolayer of ependymal cells. As ependymal cells form a barrier wall along the ventricles, the remaining stem
cells are relegated to the subependymal zone and retain only a thin apical process in contact with the cerebral
spinal fluid. This unique arrangement characterizes the stem cell niche along the lateral walls of the lateral
ventricle and supports continued neurogenesis in postnatal development. It is known that certain viruses
preferentially target the ependymal cell lining of the ventricles resulting in loss of the structural support and barrier
functions provided by the ependymal cells. Infection during periods of ependymogenesis and neurogenesis
would critically impact the development and function of the stem cell niche.
The premise of this proposal is to model infection in a controlled manner and characterize damage to, and
reparative mechanisms of, the ventricular-subventricular zone stem cell niche over the course of post-infectious
hydrocephalus. Previous work mapped the lateral ventricles in 3D (mouse and human) to determine volume,
surface area and curvature changes over the course of development. New data from lineage tracing (multi-color
vectors) and live cell imaging will document stem cell-mediated ependymogenesis versus neurogenesis and
address stem cell depletion in normal development (Aim 1). The hypothesis that enlarged ventricles
(hydrocephalus) impact stem cell niche functions and compromise neurogenesis will first be tested using a
neurovirulent component of influenza, neuraminidase, which is known to cause hydrocephalus in mice (Aim 2).
After intraventricular injection of neuraminidase in embryonic and postnatal mice, sequelae of post-infectious
hydrocephalus, critical developmental time points and potential for stem cell-mediated repair will be examined.
Following examination of a univariant, neuraminidase, hydrocephalus model, bona fide post-infectious
hydrocephalus using a mouse variant of influenza will be modeled (Aim 3). Intraventricular, intraplacental and
intranasal routes will be assessed and the impact on the ventricular-subventricular stem cell niche and its
functions will be examined. The hypothesis that induction and severity of influenza-induced post-infectious
hydrocephalus can be mitigated by prior homologous or heterologous immunity will also be tested. These studies
will define the impact that post-infectious hydrocephalus has on a critical stem cell niche and its capacity for
regenerative repair – guiding treatment strategies for post-infectious hydrocephalus."
10802189,"Abstract
The large human cerebral cortex is thought to arise from a specialized population of
outer radial glia (oRG) neural stem cells in the outer subventricular zone (OSVZ). These
stem cells divide to produce intermediate neural progenitors (INPs) that themselves
divide to produce 8-12 neurons. In contrast, most non-primate neural stem cells produce
1 or 2 neurons with each division, resulting in a smaller brain. Thus, mouse and fish
provide a relatively poor model for primate brain expansion, and direct study of primate
fetal brain tissue is problematic.
 Over the past few years, our lab and others have developed a Drosophila model
for understanding oRG-like stem cell lineages. We discovered a population of Drosophila
brain neural stem cells (called type II neuroblasts; T2NBs) that generate INPs which
each generate 8-12 neurons, similar to primate oRG stem cells. Now we can use the
power and rapidity of Drosophila genetics to characterize the role of T2NBs in brain
development, and suggest testable hypotheses for human brain organoid research.
 We previously discovered a series of transcription factors (TFs) and RNA-binding
proteins that are sequentially expressed in T2NBs over the five days of larval life; these
are excellent candidates for specifying the “temporal identity” of neurons in the lineage.
We also discovered a series of TTFs that were sequentially expressed in each INP as it
produced its lineage, and showed one of them (Eyeless, Ey; Pax6) was a validated
functional temporal factor that specified late-born neuron identity. But many open
questions remained: What are the neurons born from each temporal window in the T2NB
lineage? Do the candidate temporal factors in T2NBs actually specify neuronal identity?
Most TTFs are transiently expressed in progenitors (neuroblasts and INPs) but lack adult
expression; how are TTF-specified neuronal identities consolidated and maintained in
the adult fly? Are there TTF target genes that act to maintain neuronal identity? And
lastly, how is T2NB temporal identity and INP temporal identity integrated to specify
unique neuronal subtypes? These questions will be addressed in Aims 1-4, respectively.
Our findings will provide insight into the role of INPs in expanding brain size in
Drosophila, and suggest focused hypotheses to test for conserved mechanisms in
primate tissue. Furthermore, our results may shed light on the development of the
central complex, a conserved insect brain region used for celestial navigation of flies,
bees, and butterflies."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health concern in the US, and there is an urgent need for reliable,
inexpensive, and non-invasive biomarkers to identify individuals at risk for AD. This project aims to develop
innovative computational strategies for precision medicine in AD. Specifically, we will harmonize several large
longitudinal clinical datasets, identify DNA methylation (DNAm) biomarkers for cognitive reserve (CR), and build
DNAm-based prediction models for AD. In this project, we will improve the accuracy of DNAm-based prediction
models by leveraging knowledge of cognitive reserve, harmonizing multiple datasets, and training and testing
prediction models using samples from longitudinal studies. The DNAm-based prediction models will provide an
inexpensive and convenient approach for identifying subjects most likely to progress to clinical AD, reducing
heterogeneity in patients selected for clinical trials, and facilitating personalized treatment strategies in AD.
Additionally, identifying DNAm markers for CR will help develop novel therapeutic targets and lifestyle
interventions for preventing dementia. The successful completion of the project will also provide the community
with harmonized datasets for AD research, as well as computational methods and tools that can be easily
adapted and applied to analyze datasets in other types of dementia."

Many developmental communication disorders, such as speech sound disorder, specific language
impairment, and dyslexia, are associated with central auditory processing deficits that affect phonetic
perception. Infants learn how to classify the phonemes of their native language(s) through exposure
to speech in the first year of life, but surprisingly little is known about the neural mechanisms of this
key developmental process. The overarching goal of this project is to understand how complex
signals like speech shape cellular and circuit properties in the central auditory areas responsible for
decoding them. This research uses the zebra finch, a well-established model for auditory processing
and learning. Like speech, birdsong has a complex spectral and temporal structure, and young birds
need to hear song for normal development of auditory perception. Using the zebra finch model
enables an approach that combines strong experimental control of the acoustic structure, social
context, and timing of song experience, with intracellular and extracellular electrophysiological
measurements and analyses of protein expression and trafficking. During a critical stage in vocal
development, neurons in a cortical-level area involved in auditory learning develop diverse intrinsic
properties that influence how they process communication sounds. Aim 1 examines the acoustic
stimuli required for this plasticity to occur. Aim 2 investigates the mechanism of this experience-
dependent intrinsic plasticity. Aim 3 tests how experience affects auditory processing in noisy
conditions. By identifying how the timing and structure of auditory experience shape development at
the single-cell level in a well-described learning task, this research has significant implications for
understanding how impoverished environments can lead to auditory processing deficits associated
with a wide range of human communication disorders."

Parasitic diseases remain a problem worldwide largely due to the lack of vaccines to effectively interrupt
transmission or infection, as parasites often develop resistance to drugs. A combination of different factors
principally drives the lack of vaccines against parasitic diseases, including a limited understanding of the nature
of the humoral immune response and difficulties in proper expression of the candidate immunogen. Our current
work suggests that the GPI anchor has a vital role in humoral immune response to GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-
APs) and most vaccine efforts have utilized GPI-APs - which constitute the bulk of surface proteins in parasites,
as immunogens. However, in these vaccine formulations, the GPI-APs are without the GPI anchor to enable
soluble expression of such proteins. In this grant submission, we have shown that de-lipidation of the GPI anchor
significantly reduces antibody reactivity to GPI-APs of Toxoplasma gondii, a widespread Apicomplexa parasite
of animals. We hypothesize a role of the GPI anchor in humoral immune response and propose using mRNA
technology as an efficient method for accurate delivery of GPI-APs to the immune system to understand its role
following vaccination. We also propose the use of mRNA vaccines for the efficient delivery of highly conserved
antigens of the parasite's invasion machinery, a handful of which we propose as excellent targets to halt invasion
of apicomplexans. Thus, we will employ tools in immunology, molecular parasitology, vaccinology, and
biochemistry to dissect the aims of the study. In Aim 1, the role of the GPI anchor in humoral immunity to T.
gondii will be deciphered by comparing vaccine efficacies of parasite GPI-APs with and without their GPI
anchorage following immunization. In Aim 2, the invasion machinery of T. gondii will be targeted by vaccine-
elicited antibodies against conserved apical proteins of the plasma membrane that confer fitness to the parasite.
With the overall goal of the project being to block infection of T. gondii and apicomplexans in general, this R21
proposal will provide new insights in vaccine development against parasitic diseases."
10811504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Antibiotic resistance is becoming increasingly catastrophic. Developing novel drugs that target essential ma-
chinery in bacteria for which there is not yet resistance is critical to expanding treatment options and reducing
the toll of infections. The long-term goal of this work is to develop drug candidates that target the SUF-like
pathway of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biosynthesis as a novel treatment for drug resistant infections caused by
Gram-positive bacteria. The SUF-like pathway was recently identified as a viable drug target, but a systematic
screen against any SUF proteins remains lacking. The overall objectives of this proposal, which build off a library
screen, are to characterize and optimize three structural classes of inhibitors of the SUF-like pathway that pos-
sess favorable pharmacokinetic and ADME properties and are effective against S. aureus, E. faecalis, and S.
pneumoniae. The specific target in the proposed research is the cysteine desulfurase from the SUF-like pathway,
SufS, which has >60% sequence identity between the three named species. The central hypothesis is that small
molecules can selectively occupy the SufS active site and alkylate the catalytic cysteine residue, thereby inhib-
iting cysteine desulfurase activity and causing reduced cell viability in Gram-positive bacteria. This hypothesis is
supported by preliminary data, including the screening of an acrylamide compound library against SufS from S.
aureus, which identified 18 hits that covalently modify SufS and inhibit cysteine desulfurase activity. The central
hypothesis will be tested through three specific aims: assess the (1) bioactivity and (2) biochemistry of the 18
hits and (3) synthetically modify the hits to improve potency and drug-likeness. In Aim 1, the inhibitors will be
assessed for their efficacy against S. aureus, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae; their specificity in S. aureus; and
their drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties. In Aim 2, the binding residue and binding mode of the
inhibitors will be determined using X-ray crystallography, and potency will be assessed using dose response
assays. In Aim 3, the best inhibitors will be synthetically modified to increase their potency and selectivity using
structure-guided drug design. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first known effort dedicated
to pursuing the SUF-like pathway as a drug target for new antibacterial agents, and it involves the first systematic
screening of a compound library against the SUF-like pathway. The proposed research is significant because
the results will provide a framework for developing novel broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, for which there is
not yet resistance, to treat infections from three Gram-positive infections, including S. aureus, E. faecalis, and
S. pneumoniae, which are all listed as serious threats by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention. Addi-
tionally, this work will enhance our understanding of the effects of modulating the SUF-like pathway and lay the
foundation for identifying other targets that rely on the SUF-like pathway, such as M. tuberculosis and parasites
that causes malaria, thereby adding a powerful new tool to improve human health and well-being."

There have been several reported cases of seizures in youths following electronic nicotine delivery systems
(ENDS) use, prompting an investigation by the Federal Drug Administration. Although reports show that ENDS
aerosols contain fewer numbers and lower levels of toxicants than conventional cigarettes, there is evidence of
adverse biological effects in humans, and the long-term effects of ENDS exposure with nicotine (NIC) and
flavorings such as menthol on seizure susceptibility are unknown. The reports of illnesses associated with ENDS
challenge the concept that they are a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes and underscore the urgent
need for studies to elucidate the health effects of ENDS. Seizures are linked to smoking through genetic
mutations and by exposure to high levels of nicotine, but the effects of NIC exposure via ENDS use is unknown.
Using our rodent-validated vapor inhalation system, our preliminary data indicates that inhalation of NIC leads
to changes in body weight, locomotor activity, and somatic signs of dependence and causes profound changes
in glutamate regulatory proteins, suggesting increased neuronal activity. The central hypothesis of the current
proposal is that exposure to ENDS disrupts neuronal function and increases seizure susceptibility via alteration
in glutamate homeostasis. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: 1) To test the hypothesis
that exposure to ENDS with menthol increases seizure susceptibility and 2) To test the hypothesis that ENDS
with menthol exposure increases neuronal hyperexcitability. Given the dramatic increase in ENDS use, the need
for fundamental research on its health effects is imperative. The proposed research will lead to a greater
understanding of the fundamental effects of ENDS use with nicotine on neuronal hyperexcitability and seizure
susceptibility. These data will provide critical first step towards understanding the effect of ENDS use, which will
help guide individuals and policy makers in making informed decisions about ENDS use."
10810967,"Project Summary
Histoplasma capsulatum causes pulmonary and systemic infections in both healthy and immunocompromised
individuals, and is the most common cause of fungal respiratory infections in healthy hosts. It is a dimorphic
fungal pathogen that can sense and respond to human body temperature by changing its growth program from
a filamentous (mold) form to a parasitic yeast form. Infection occurs when the soil is disrupted, facilitating
dispersion of hyphal fragments or spores that are inhaled by humans. Once introduced into the host, the
pathogen converts to a budding-yeast form, which survives and replicates within host macrophages. In the
laboratory, the switch between the infectious and parasitic states is modeled by changing the temperature: cells
grow in the filamentous form at room temperature, whereas growth at 37ºC is sufficient to trigger growth in the yeast
form and expression of virulence factors. In previous studies, we and others have identified four transcriptional
regulators, Ryp1,2,3,4, which are required for yeast-phase growth and virulence gene expression. Ryps directly
regulate expression of a set of yeast-phase specific genes that encode proteins with putative secretion signals
and transmembrane helices; thus, form the core of the yeast-phase specific transcriptional network. In
preliminary studies, we have found that two major players of the heat shock response, the heat shock factor
Hsf1 and a chaperone Hsp90, also regulate the yeast-phase growth under in vitro conditions. However, these
genes are essential and their function cannot be studied by conventional knockout strategies in Histoplasma.
There is limited research done in Histoplasma, in part due to the limitation of the genetic tools available. In
particular, there is no controllable gene expression systems that can be used to study gene function in vivo. In
this project, we aim to develop controllable (Tet-inducible and Tet-repressible) gene expression systems and
optimize episomal DNA maintenance. Using the Tet-inducible system, we will induce expression of knockdown
cassettes for Ryp1,2,3,4, Hsf1 and Hsp90 under in vivo conditions and assess their role in maintenance of the
parasitic growth in vivo. In addition, we will identify centromeric sequences and/or DNA elements that promote
autonomous replication or segregation; and utilize them in episomal vectors to ensure proper segregation of the
episomal DNA during cell division. We will generate knockdown and overexpression mutants of yeast- or hyphal-
phase specific transcription factors using improved episomal vectors. Ultimately, results of the experiments
proposed in this project will further advance our ability to study gene function in Histoplasma, and will expand
our knowledge of the transcriptional network that governs the parasitic yeast-phase growth."

The Overall Goal of the MIEHR Research Center is to elucidate contributions of the biological, physical, social
and built environments of the environmental riskcape to environmental health disparities in pregnant women and
their infants. Importantly, this guiding vision aligns closely with community concerns about infant mortality,
preterm birth and other maternal and infant outcomes among African-Americans. The Community Engagement
and Dissemination Core (CEDC) of the MIEHR Research Center will be essential to achieving this vision.
Our leadership team, Director Dr. Robert Bullard (widely known as the “Father of Environmental Justice”) and
Associate Director Dr. Denae King, of the Barbara Jordan – Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas
Southern University (TSU), are uniquely qualified to lead this Core. Together they will build upon their existing
community partnerships and activities to develop a robust communications and engagement network in the
greater Houston area that is committed to reducing environmental health disparities in maternal and infant health.
Drs. Bullard and King have strong ties to vulnerable, predominantly African-American, communities in Houston,
the 4th largest and most diverse city in the country. The CEDC will serve as the nexus for facilitating multi-
directional communications among MIEHR Center leadership, investigators (including Pilot Project awardees),
and community partners. The CEDC will support and complement Center research activities through
multidirectional communication with our stakeholders; for example, by informing investigators of community
priorities and translating and disseminating findings from Center research (including Pilot Project research) to
diverse audiences, most importantly to residents who live in environmentally overburdened and
socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. An engaged Community Advisory Board (CAB) will consist of
community leaders and environmental health partners, each of whom will provide a different “lens” through which
to view environmental issues, including many with whom we have long-standing relationships. Hence, the CAB
will be key to successful community interactions with stakeholders, and have a vital role in determining what,
when, how and to whom findings from Research and Pilot Projects will be communicated via multi-level, multi-
directional and multi-modal engagement. Qualitative research methods will be used to ground truth research
findings and develop infographics, fact sheets and presentations for translating and disseminating information
related to the environmental riskscape and risk reduction. In addition, the CEDC will enhance community
resilience by educating investigators, community leaders and the CAB on best practices for impactful policy
advocacy using study findings. Finally, evaluation is a critical component and activity of the CEDC, which will
play an important role in determing whether goals are met, the extent of success of processes and engagement
procedures utilized, and the impact of the Center on enhanced community environmental health literacy,
numeracy advocacy and resilience capacity."
10813750,"Despite advances in health care, African-Americans (AA) continue to experience a disproportionate burden of
poor obstetric outcomes. This is alarming as pregnancy is a window of future health and many obstetric
outcomes, such as preterm birth, are associated with severe morbidity and mortality for both the mother and her
infant and result in high societal and economic costs. Unfortunately, the origin of racial disparities in obstetric
outcomes does not appear to be genetic nor fully explained by individual-level factors; thus, we must look toward
the broader context in the physical, built, and social environments to mitigate racial disparities in maternal health.
Because communities of color and low socioeconomic status experience a higher burden of chemical exposures,
in part due to the proximity of their neighborhoods to key exposure sources (e.g., industry and hazardous waste
sites), ‘environment’ has been hypothesized to be a driver of racial disparities in obstetric outcomes. Two classes
of pollutants with historic contamination in Houston, TX are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals,
which have each been positively associated with preterm birth. Additionally, under an environmental riskscape
framework, place-based stressors may also contribute to racial disparities in maternal health by directly
influencing disease risk and by modifying women’s susceptibility to chemical exposures. Enhanced
understanding of the role of the riskscape, and mixtures of chemical and non-chemical stressors, in racial
disparities in obstetric outcomes would promote efforts to design successful interventions and improve the
wellbeing of health disparity populations. Finally, Houston is a disaster-prone area, which may result in increased
exposures to chemical, biological and non-chemical stressors that may be heightened among health disparity
populations. Our goal is to mitigate maternal and infant health disparities in an overburdened population living in
a disaster-prone region. To achieve this goal, the Objective of this Research Project, The Environmental
Riskscape, Disasters and Obstetric Outcomes, is to utilize a large-scale perinatal biobank and data repository
(PeriBank) at Baylor College of Medicine to characterize racial disparities in the riskscape of AA and non-
Hispanic white (NHW) pregnant women in Houston, to assess associations between the mixture of chemical and
non-chemical stressors in the riskscape on preterm birth, and explore the impact of a natural disaster of
unprecedented magnitude (Hurricane Harvey) on racial disparities in chemical exposures. Through the
application of a riskscape-based approach paired with statistical methods to address mixture effects, the results
from this study will enhance our understanding of the roles of chemical and non-chemical stressors in racial
disparities in preterm birth in a disaster-prone region. This work will lay the foundation for future studies to
improve our understanding of drivers of black-white disparities in obstetric outcomes, research that is imperative
for the development and successful implementation of preventive interventions to mitigate these disparities."
10813752,"ABSTRACT
A woman’s wellbeing during pregnancy affects her short- and long-term health as well as that of her infant. In
fact, preterm delivery is a leading indicator of health in the U.S. because of its devastating impacts on neonatal
mortality and morbidity with estimated economic costs that exceed 25 billion dollars each year. Despite
advances over the last decade in reducing the annual prevalence of preterm birth to under 10%, persistent racial
inequities remain that pose significant challenges to improving maternal and child health among health disparity
populations in the U.S. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), which consist of eclampsia, preeclampsia
and gestational hypertension, affect up to 10% of pregnancies and, like preterm delivery, increase maternal risks
of mortality and morbidity that extend far beyond post-partum periods. Significant racial disparities exist, with
African-American (AA) women at greatest risk for preterm birth and for dying from HDP than any other racial or
ethnic group in the U.S. Traditional risk factors (e.g., maternal sociodemographic characteristics, behaviors,
reproductive history and access to quality health care) do not fully explain racial disparities in preterm birth or
other obstetric outcomes. To elucidate determinants of these racial disparities, we must consider aspects of the
broader biological, physical, social and built environments that may affect women’s health, and move toward an
integrated assessment of these factors to more accurately predict risk. Pregnant women in Houston are an at
risk population. As a petrochemical hub and fourth largest city in the U.S., Houston is a microcosm for identifying
factors of the biological, physical, social, and built environments that constitute the “environmental riskscape”.
Defining riskscape features underlying preterm birth and other obstetric outcomes will inform our understanding
of determinants of racial disparities in these outcomes in Houston and for disparity populations across the nation.
The overall Objective of this Research Project, Disparities-aware Classifiers for Maternal and Infant Health,
is to develop “disparities-aware” classifiers that identify major drivers of preterm birth and HDP using an inclusive
environmental riskscape framework. To do so, we will conduct a study building upon the unique PeriBank
resource at Baylor College of Medicine to acquire data on maternal biological [circulating cell-free RNA (cfRNA)
and microbiome] and chemical (PAH and metal) exposures, as well as features of the social and built
environments. These data will be used to identify informative features that can be integrated into AA and non-
Hispanic white (NHW) disparities-aware classifiers for preterm birth and HDP. Predictive disparities-aware
classifiers that rely on attributes of individual- and place-level stressors have the potential for identifying major
drivers of preterm birth and HDP among AA and NHW women and provide direction for developing interventions
to mitigate disparities and improve the health and well-being of women and their infants."

10813787,"CANCER RESEARCH EDUCATION TRAINING AND COORDINATION (CRTEC): PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) is to increase the pool of next-
generation cancer researchers and professionals and to develop and integrate cancer-focused training,
education, and professional development activities across all levels of learners. This is realized through
sustaining and growing the depth and breadth of the cancer research enterprise by recruiting promising junior
faculty members, student/postdoctoral trainees, and other medical professionals, and by providing them with
strong mentoring and training support. CRTEC is led by Kounosuke Watabe, PhD, Associate Director, and
Heidi Klepin, MD, MS, Assistant Director. Both have extensive experience in translational and clinical cancer
research training and education. Annually, CRTEC provides career development services to over 800
individuals, including high school and undergraduate students, pre- and postdoctoral trainees, faculty members,
and medical professionals. Over the project period, CRTEC designed tailored programs that have trained more
than 180 under-represented minorities (URMs), or 22% of all its trainees. CRTEC also helped establish two new
NCI-funded T32 training programs and one NCI-funded R25 entitled, “Training Program to Promote Diversity in
Cancer”. Through this R25 award, CRTEC built a community network with two Historically Black Colleges and
University institutions in the catchment area of Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC)
to recruit underrepresented trainees. Over 100 Cancer Center members participate in seven other NIH-funded
training programs. Since 2016, more than 90 pre- and post-doctoral trainees are now independent faculty
members at various institutions, 13 faculty members received career development awards, and 18 junior faculty
obtained R-type research funding as a result of rigorous training and mentoring activities. CRTEC is strongly
committed to supporting the career development of next-generation cancer researchers and has developed
multiple innovative approaches, including a Cancer Career Development Award, Clinical Trial Boot Camp,
Director's Cancer Research Award for Trainees, NIH F/K grant workshops, and travel awards for pre- and post-
doctoral fellows. In addition, CRTEC successfully advocated for salary support of Institutional training program
Directors and funding for high school summer internships. To further strengthen the WFBCCC training
infrastructure, CRTEC sets four Specific Aims for the next funding period: (1) provide a strong infrastructure to

10813790,"CANCER PREVENTION AND CONTROL (CPC) PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Cancer Prevention and Control (CPC) Program is to foster scientific discovery across the cancer
continuum that translates into clinical, community, and policy strategies to improve cancer outcomes. Although
organized under several names during the past 50 years, cancer prevention and control research has been a
foundational program of the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) since its first
Cancer Center Support Grant Award in the 1970s. Currently, the CPC Program is the largest WFBCCC Program,
with 45 scientific members representing 16 departments. The CPC Program is led by Eric Donny, PhD, and
John Salsman, PhD who guide the scientific direction of the Program and the integration of CPC research with
other WFBCCC Programs. Members prioritize research relevant to the WFBCCC catchment area and Center-
wide strategic priorities, most notably: Tobacco, Health Disparities, and Survivorship. The CPC Program
conducts rigorous and translatable research across three Specific Aims: (1) Improve health behaviors
associated with reduced risk of cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality; (2) Enhance quality of life and reduce
symptom burden for survivors through the development of optimal supportive care interventions; and (3)
Advance cancer care delivery by discovering strategies to improve the effectiveness and implementation of best
and promising practices across the continuum of care. These scientific foci guide CPC programmatic strategies,
which include hypothesis-driven research tied to catchment area needs; integration with key institutional
resources; collaboration with other WFBCCC Programs, regional National Cancer Institute-Designated
Comprehensive Cancer Centers, and community partners; and organizational strategies that promote the
scientific vision and aims of the CPC Program. Since the last renewal, CPC Program investigators have made
major contributions to the science of tobacco control; implementation of smoking cessation interventions;
determinants of emerging risk factors for cancer, including alcohol use, obesity, and physical activity; disparities
in survivorship care; digital health interventions; patient-reported outcomes and quality of life; adolescent and
young adult survivorship; implementation science; and low-dose CT screening. The CPC Program is the primary
scientific home for the Wake Forest NCI Community Oncology Research Program Research Base (WF-NCORP-
RB), the ECOG-ACRIN NCORP Research Base, a new NCI P50 Implementation Science Center on Cancer
Control, and a multi-institutional NIDA U54 on tobacco regulatory science. In 2020, CPC Program members
received a total of $13M in cancer-focused, peer-reviewed funding (direct costs), of which $8M (62%) was from
NCI and $5M (38%) from other NIH sources. During the current project period, members authored a total of 284
cancer- relevant publications; 87 (32%) were intra-programmatic, 37 (14%) were inter-programmatic, and 24

10813792,"CANCER GENETICS AND METABOLISM (CGM) PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent discoveries have uncovered an intimate interplay between genetics and metabolism in cancer. The
finding that isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations alter metabolism by producing an onco-metabolite that results
in changes of the epigenome and leads to cancer elegantly illustrates this dynamic. Targeting the mitochondrial
tricarboxylic acid cycle by inhibiting the ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes
is another example. These advances have formed the scientific basis for the formation of a Cancer Genetics and
Metabolism (CGM) Program at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC). The CGM
Program seeks to make significant impacts through highly collaborative and integrated projects to: (1)
characterize key genetic/epigenetic/metabolic events underlying tumor initiation and progression and response
to therapy in the major cancer types and key health disparities of the WFBCCC catchment area; (2) develop and
strengthen clinical trials targeting specific genetic defects and metabolic intervention points associated with
cancer; and (3) identify biomarkers to guide precision treatment. Although WFBCCC has had a strong emphasis
in cancer genetics and metabolism research for the past decade, the CGM Program was not formally organized
until 2018 in response to recommendations by the WFBCCC External Advisory Board. The CGM Program now
boasts 30 investigators and is co-led by two well-established scientists with distinct research expertise who have
collaboratively built a highly synergistic Program – Mikhail Nikiforov, PhD, a translational scientist pioneering
significant discoveries in understanding metabolic processes governing progression and drug resistance of
melanoma and multiple myeloma, and Timothy Pardee, MD, PhD, a physician-scientist with a track record in
elucidating the role of metabolism in resistance to therapies for acute myeloid leukemia. The CGM Program’s
total peer-reviewed, direct funding base is $4.4M. Although the CGM Program was formally established only in
2018, this highly collaborative group of investigators has authored since 2016 a total of 212 cancer-focused
research publications, of which 78 (37%) were intra-programmatic, 70 (33%) were inter-programmatic, and 154
(73%) represented inter-institutional collaborations. More than 37 (17%) of these publications involved seminal
discoveries and translational breakthroughs published in top-tier journals such as Cell, Cancer Cell, Lancet
Oncology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Annals of Oncology, Cell Metabolism, Nature Communications, Nucleic
Acids Research, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Leukemia, and Clinical Cancer Research. In 2020, the CGM

Program aims to dissect key signaling pathways regulating cancer progression and metastasis and to integrate
this knowledge with the development of innovative technologies and therapeutics. The SBT Program comprises
36 cancer-focused investigators representing nine departments from two Schools, the Wake Forest School of
Medicine and the Virginia Tech – Wake Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences. The
SBT Program is led by two well-established scientists with distinct research expertise – Rafael Davalos, PhD,

Program by guiding its scientific direction to ensure alignment with the cancer burden within the WFBCCC’s
catchment area, catalyzing transdisciplinary collaborations, and promoting career development of junior
investigators. Among many recent reported discoveries and observations, SBT Program members have (1)
developed an innovative technology to label metabolites, resulting in a sensor of lactate and offering a new
revolutionary strategy for targeting cancer and viral infection; (2) designed a new microfluidic platform known as
contactless dielectrophoresis which isolates circulating tumor cells from blood and serves as a marker-free
method to identify tumor initiating cells; (3) invented NanoKnife®, a technology that ablates undesirable tissue
in a non-thermal manner known as irreversible electroporation; this technology has proven to be optimal for
reversing local immunosuppression, activating the innate immune system, and engaging the adaptive immune
system which can improve patient responsiveness to immunotherapeutics; (4) identified a new subset of T cells,
Th9 cells, establishing a new paradigm for T cell-based cancer therapy; and (5) invented TheraBionic P1, a
device that emits low levels of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields for the systemic treatment of advanced
hepatocellular carcinoma. The SBT Program’s total peer-reviewed, direct funding base is $5.5M. Since 2016,
this highly collaborative group of investigators authored a total of 242 program-related research publications, of
which 72 (30%) were inter-programmatic, 42 (17%) were intra-programmatic, and 168 (69%) represented inter-
institutional collaborations. Just over 17% of these publications involved seminal discoveries and translational
breakthroughs published in top-tier journals such as Cell, Nature Biotechnology, Cancer Cell, Nature
Immunology, Nature Cell Biology, Biomaterials, Molecular Cell, Nature Communications, and Advanced

10813797,"NEURO-ONCOLOGY (NRO) PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Neuro-Oncology (NRO) Program seeks to understand the etiopathogenesis and progression of primary
brain tumors and brain metastases and to use this knowledge to improve the overall survival and quality of life
of patients. The three scientific focal areas within the Program include: (1) understanding the molecular
underpinnings of brain tumor initiation and progression as well as cancer metastasis to the brain; (2) developing
novel medical devices, techniques, and drug candidates to advance improved therapeutic approaches; and (3)
designing innovative clinical trial interventions that will halt disease progression and limit the toxic effects of
therapy. Although the NRO Program science broadly spans these three focal areas, the investigators have
developed deep expertise in glioblastoma and breast and lung cancer brain metastases. As a reflection of this
depth and a significant team science approach within the Program, NRO investigators secured a National Cancer
Institute (NCI) P01 award focused on novel drug candidates and new ways of treatment delivery for glioblastoma,
as well as nine new Department of Defense and NCI awards in breast cancer brain metastasis during the past
few years. The NRO Program’s robust clinical trials portfolio also leverages a rich history of brain tumor research
at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) through long-standing participation in the
NCI-funded Adult Brain Tumor Consortium and other national brain tumor collaborations. The portfolio also
includes NRO investigator-initiated trials launched through WFBCCC’s NCI Community Oncology Research
Program Research Base and other sponsored partnerships. Although WFBCCC has had a strong brain
tumor/brain metastasis research focus for the past decade, the NRO Program was not formally organized until
2018 in response to recommendations by the WFBCCC External Advisory Board. The NRO Program now boasts

10813798,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (COE): PROJECT SUMMARY
The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) serves a 58-county region in western North
Carolina, southwestern Virginia, and southern West Virginia. This catchment area is largely rural and has
significant racial, ethnic, and geographic cancer disparities, driven largely by elevated cancer risk factors

region, and beyond; and (4) promote policy and advocacy directed at reducing the cancer burden and disparities
and advancing cancer health equity. COE activities are facilitated through the Office of Cancer Health Equity
(OCHE), led by Ronny Bell, PhD, MS, (Director) and assisted by Kathryn Weaver, PhD, MPH, (Assistant
Director, Research Integration), and Carla Strom, MLA (Assistant Director, Operations). The COE staff reflects
the diversity of the catchment area and includes Population Health Navigators, Community Educators, and
Research Facilitators. Bell receives guidance and input from the Community Advisory Board, which ensures
integration of community engagement into the clinical, research, and educational activities of the WFBCCC. The
COE uses the COE Internal Steering Committee to coordinate research and training activities across WFBCCC
Programs. The COE has been very successful in increasing participation of underserved populations in cancer
clinical trials. For example, the year prior to the start of the Underserved Patient Navigation Program, 20% of
Hispanic patients participated in interventional studies. Among navigated patients, the participation rate
increased from 14% to 34%. To ensure that COE achieves its mission, COE effectiveness will be assessed
through monitoring: (1) research addressing catchment needs and disparities; (2) minority participation in
research; (3) awareness and knowledge of cancer prevention and control strategies; and, (4) access to culturally
appropriate cancer-related care. Future directions for the COE will focus on expanding data collection activities
through enhanced analytic tools; developing collaborations outside North Carolina; forming collaborative
relationships through the new strategic alliance between Wake Forest Baptist Health and Atrium Health ; and
working toward local, state, and national policies focused on eliminating cancer disparities."
10813802,"SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT (SRM): PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) Shared Resources
Management (SRM) team is to ensure Center members have access to state-of-the-art technologies and quality
services to enhance high-impact cancer research and to promote dynamic scientific interaction and productivity.
Shared Resources (SRs) are overseen by Pierre-Alexandre Vidi, PhD, Associate Director (AD) of SR
Management (SRM). SRM’s Specific Aims are to: (1) Provide a unified management system to facilitate
operation and maintenance of state-of-the-art instrumentation, technologies, and quality services and to
maximize cost-effectiveness; (2) Coordinate the development of new services, the acquisition of equipment, and
phasing out of obsolete platforms and services, based on formal feedback mechanisms and strategic research
directions within the WFBCCC; (3) Promote intra- and inter-institutional collaboration of SRs to streamline project
pipelines and further expand services offered to WFBCCC investigators; and (4) Foster educational and training
initiatives of SRs through workshops, seminars, and courses. WFBCCC currently has nine SRs: Bioinformatics,
Biostatistics, Cell Engineering, Cancer Genomics, Crystallography and Computational Biosciences, Flow
Cytometry, Proteomics and Metabolomics, Qualitative and Patient Reported Outcomes, and Tumor Tissue and
Pathology. Two of these SRs (Qualitative and Patient-Reported Outcomes and Bioinformatics) were developed
over the project period and are fully operational. The SRs are managed by highly qualified Directors and
experienced staff. Reporting to the WFBCCC Director, Vidi oversees all SR operations and budget management.
There are two venues to support the management, planning, and evaluation of SRs. First, there is a Shared
Resource Advisory Committee (SRAC) for each SR. Each SRAC meets bi-annually and discusses the SR’s
scientific and financial performance, user fees, as well as needs for new services, and/or sunsetting obsolete
ones. Second, Vidi convenes an SR Oversight Committee, bringing together all SR Directors with the WFBCCC
Senior Leadership, to review and set overall policy for SR operations and to provide a forum for in-depth
discussions of the evolving research needs of WFBCCC investigators. SRs play a critical role in supporting the
WFBCCC Programs’ high-quality scientific research. During the current funding cycle, SRs provided a broad
range of services to all four WFBCCC Programs, directly contributing to research reported in over 450
publications and providing direct support services to 82% of the current WFBCCC members in support of their
cancer research."
10813804,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION (LPE): PROJECT SUMMARY
The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) Leadership, Planning, and Evaluation is
an essential multi-level process that identifies strategic opportunities, performs ongoing evaluation, and develops
Center initiatives. The Cancer Center Director establishes the vision for the WFBCCC with input from the Senior
Leaders and feedback from the various planning and evaluation activities and committees. WFBCCC’s vision is
to be a preeminent leader in advancing the understanding of cancer through research innovation, discovery, and
translation into innovative therapies and prevention strategies through exemplary collaboration and community
engagement. WFBCCC’s mission is to reduce cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality along the rural
southeast Appalachian region of the United States, as well as nationally and internationally, through cutting-edge
research and treatment, community education and outreach, and transdisciplinary training of next-generation
biomedical scientists and healthcare providers. Implementation is guided by a well-developed Strategic Plan,
which was informed by Cancer Center stakeholders, including its advisory bodies, the Institution, the community,
and Center members. Planning and evaluation activities address both the strategic priorities and Center
operations. They also thoroughly assess program goals, transdisciplinary and translational research, community
outreach and engagement, education and training development, strategic recruitment, pilot project support, the
clinical trial portfolio, and accrual strategy. The strong commitment to planning and evaluation activities has been
critical to WFBCCC’s achievement of its strategic goals. The process relies on both internal and external boards.
Internationally renowned translational researcher and WFBCCC Director, Boris Pasche, MD, PhD, leads a team
of eight Associate Directors who comprise his Senior Leadership team. They contribute their unparalleled
expertise, vision, and strategic planning skills to mobilize the support required to bring initiatives to fruition. Senior
Leadership comprises the Executive Committee, which is the primary research advisory body for WFBCCC that
makes mission-critical recommendations to the WFBCCC Director for all facets of the Cancer Center related to
research. It reviews the progress and future directions of the research programs, shared resources, and other
components of the Cancer Center Support Grant. In addition to his Senior Leadership, Pasche relies upon the
following major advisory mechanisms for input and advice: the External Advisory Board, comprised of outside
experts who provide essential independent and objective evaluation and advice for the WFBCC; the Community
Advisory Board, which advises the Center on effective ways to integrate community engagement into clinical,
research, and educational activities, with the goal of reducing cancer burden in the catchment area; and the
Internal Advisory Board, made up of Institutional leaders, which advises the Center on optimal coordination of
resources and how to align Cancer Center priorities across the enterprise and the community it serves."
10813806,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM): PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center
(WFBCCC) facilitates translational science by providing services that enable and promote the conduct of high-
quality clinical research. These services include managing processes and providing expertise that enable high-
quality protocol development and efficient trial activation, along with supporting the infrastructural elements of
clinical research – finance, regulatory, data, and clinical research coordinator and nursing management – to
promote WFBCCC science and its translation into the community and to promulgate NCI and Cancer Center
Support Grant objectives for clinical research. CPDM also maintains a centralized protocol document directory,
a centralized database of protocol-specific data, and data and safety monitoring activities that promote high
quality performance and study completion while ensuring participant safety. Since CPDM’s consolidation shortly
before the previous competing review into a fully centralized model, under the leadership of Stefan Grant, MD,
JD, MBA, Medical Director of CPDM, a new clinical trial management system, OnCore®, has been fully
implemented, the Florence® electronic regulatory binder system has been deployed, and staffing has been
expanded. In the 2020 grant year, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, CPDM reported the recruitment of 14,022
accruals into all clinical research studies within WFBCCC, including 424 accruals into interventional treatment
trials, and facilitated the activation of 95 new studies.
A Data and Safety Monitoring Plan is required for all interventional studies. For WFBCCC investigator-initiated
studies, risk-based monitoring is conducted by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) to ensure the
highest levels of patient safety. Effective quality control functions are also instituted to ensure the highest level
of protocol compliance according to the 2021 WFBCCC’s NCI-approved DSM Plan.
WBFCCC supports multiple proactive efforts to promote the recruitment of women and minorities in research.
These efforts have included working with the Office of Cancer Health Equity to assess catchment area needs
and launch initiatives to support underserved patients through education and navigation. In 2020, of all
individuals enrolled into interventional and non-interventional studies, 57% were women, 3% Hispanic, and 21%
were a racial minority. WFBCCC also supports the NIH policy on the inclusion of individuals across the lifespan
in research. In 2020, 51 children and 266 adults over the age of 65 were enrolled onto interventional studies."
10813807,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS): PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to provide independent peer review of the
scientific merit, priority, feasibility, and progress of all clinical cancer research studies conducted within the Wake
Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC). The PRMS functions are accomplished by rigorous
evaluations through a multi-stage review process conducted by: (1) WFBCCC’s multidisciplinary Disease-
Oriented Teams (DOTs), where initial assessment of value, fit, and prioritization within the existing portfolio of
studies is performed; (2) a Clinical Protocol and Data Management Feasibility Group (CPDM-FG), which reviews
all operational considerations and/or logistical aspects of studies to ensure timely activation and completion; and
(3) the Protocol Review Committee (PRC), which is the definitive independent authority for determining which
studies proceed to activation based on scientific merit. The DOT approval and CPDM-FG’s review are required
before proceeding to the PRC; however, only the PRC has final authority with regards to determining which
studies will be activated. The PRMS process ensures that all WFBCCC clinical cancer research studies are: (1)
scientifically sound; (2) effectively designed, specifically from a biostatistics perspective; (3) appropriately
prioritized within the DOT’s research portfolio to avoid competing trials as well as align with WFBCCC’s overall
institutional priorities for clinical research; (4) feasible for activation and completion (or in meeting institutional
target accrual goals); (5) assessed for the adequacy of the data and safety monitoring plans based on the risk
level of the study; and (6) monitored regularly for accrual and scientific progress. In 2020, the WFBCCC DOTs
vetted in aggregate 185 studies and forwarded 112 of these studies to the CPDM-FG. Eighty-seven of these
studies proceeded to PRC review. Once received by the PRC, 29 studies received an initial expedited review by
a PRC Chair as they had already received an appropriate external scientific peer review, and 58 studies, primarily
representing WFBCCC’s investigator-initiated and industry-sponsored trials, were forwarded for full PRC review.
More than 28% (24/87) of the studies fully reviewed by the PRC required modifications prior to approval. None
of the studies were disapproved. In addition, all studies were monitored for scientific and accrual progress, and
10 underperforming studies were closed in 2020. The PRMS, inclusive of the DOTs, CPDM-FG, and PRC review
processes, is one of the most critical functions that the WFBCCC performs to ensure the highest quality of
research is being conducted."
10813847,"While advances in imaging technologies are enabling scientists to observe cellular phenomena and
protein complexes in increasingly greater detail, our ability to perturb and manipulate cells with
equally fine precision have lagged. To better understand the dynamic cellular environment, tools that
can selectively perturb biological processes, in real-time, with fast, reversible, tunable, and spatially-
selective control are required. A major step forward in this area has come from the field of cellular
optogenetics, wherein photosensory proteins are engineered to control various cellular processes with
light. Because light can be delivered with fast temporal and subcellular spatial precision, such tools
allow unprecedented biological control. In prior work, we developed novel optogenetic tools based on
the plant photoreceptor cryptochrome 2 (CRY2), which can be used to precisely manipulate protein
interactions, localization, and activity. While these tools have been successful at regulating protein
function, improvements and new strategies for optogenetic regulation are needed. In the proposed
work, we will usher in a new wave of optogenetic engineering, improving upon existing strategies,
extending optogenetic tools into new areas, developing new photoreceptor modules, and testing novel
engineering designs to regulate protein function with light. The long term goals of the project are to
enable a set of modular precision tools for probing and manipulating biochemical processes with fast
temporal control and over spatial scales ranging from subcellular to organismal."
10814185,"Project Abstract
Sports-related concussion (SRC), while often regarded as the mildest form of traumatic brain injury (TBI), is
nevertheless a significant public health issue. Based on the estimates by the Centers for Disease Control, 1.6
to 3.8 million SRCs occur annually among high school and collegiate athletes. Athletes sustaining acute
concussion have a wide spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms including psychological distress, cognitive
impairment, and somatic symptoms. In some cases, these symptoms persist, and people with mild TBI may
be at higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases, future TBI, and, in cases of repetitive injuries, chronic
traumatic encephalopathy. While standardized assessment tools are useful in the clinical management of
acute concussion, the underlying pathophysiology of SRC and the time course of physiological recovery after
injury remain unclear. There is an immediate need to address the heterogeneity in the long-term
consequences of SRC to facilitate concussion management. The proposed research aims to understand why
some concussed athletes have prolonged recovery time and, more importantly, how to detect such extreme
cases.
Diffuse axonal injury is generally believed to be the initial white matter neuropathology associated with mild
TBI. Nevertheless, this microscopic injury is more difficult to detect in human mild TBI. Modern diffusion MRI
techniques offer increased biological specificity for describing white-matter alterations. Therefore, the goal of
the proposed research is to determine whether these novel axonal metrics: (1) provide indirect evidence of
diffuse axonal injury in human SRC; (2) help to explain heterogeneity in individual recovery trajectories; and (3)
inform our understanding of the relationship between axonal injury in SRC and clinical manifestations of SRC."
10814161,"Project Summary
Vision arises from the combination of viewing and visual processing. How animals align viewing strategies with
regional processing specializations to accomplish specific behavioral tasks is unclear. We recently discovered
that mice use binocular vision to pursue and capture insects. Here, we follow up on this discovery to understand
the retinal signals and downstream pathways that mediate binocular vision for predation (Aim 1) and control the
gaze to keep targets within the binocular visual field (Aim 2). Mammalian binocular vision relies on the presence
of ipsilaterally projecting retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We recently reported that nine of the 40+ mouse RGC
types have ipsilateral projections. Here, we test the hypothesis, that two ipsilaterally projecting RGC types, the
sustained ON and sustained OFF alpha (sONα- and sOFFα-) RGCs, guide binocular predation. We have
developed intersectional transgenic tools to selectively label, silence, and remove the ipsilaterally projecting
sONα- and sOFFα-RGCs (~300 cells, ~0.6% of RGCs). The sONα- and sOFFα-RGCs show increased density
and acuity (i.e., reduced receptive field size) in the ventrotemporal retina. In Aim 1, we will combine transgenic
and immunohistochemical labeling and high-resolution imaging of whole retinas to understand the organization
of the sONα- and sOFFα-RGC acute zone in the ventrotemporal retina. We will analyze how sONα- and sOFFα-
RGCs encode local, global, and combined motion individually and as populations with targeted patch clamping
and two-photon calcium imaging. Visual stimulus parameters will be based on analyses of our large 3D tracking
dataset of mice hunting crickets. Next, we will assess the binocular processing of sONα- and sOFFα-RGC signals
by specific neurons in the superior colliculus, the retinorecipient target mediating predation. Finally, we will
measure the contributions of ipsilaterally projecting sONα- and sOFFα-RGCs to predation using selective
silencing and removal and 3D behavior tracking. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that ON-OFF direction-
selective (DS-) RGCs control the gaze to keep prey within the binocular visual field during pursuit and capture.
Combining two-photon calcium imaging and immunohistochemistry, we will analyze the topographic maps of
DS-RGC direction preferences around the sONα- and sOFFα-RGC acute zone. We will use targeted patch clamp
recordings and two-photon calcium imaging to understand how ON-OFF DS-RGCs encode local, global, and
combined motion stimuli with ethologically relevant parameters and in vivo electrophysiology to analyze the
transformation of their signals by specific neurons in the superior colliculus, which mediates gaze shifts. Finally,
we will test the impact of removing direction selectivity from ON-OFF DS-RGCs on gaze control during predation.
Our studies will reveal how two conserved RGC subclasses, their regional specializations in the retina (acute
zones and topographic direction preference maps), and downstream pathways cooperate to align viewing
strategies and visual processing for an essential survival behavior."
10814366,"SIGNIFICANCE: Our long-term goal is to discover novel regulatory components of a core mechanism of
cellular communication, i.e., signaling via heterotrimeric G proteins (henceforth trimeric G proteins), and to
characterize the molecular mechanisms that underlie their involvement in human disease. Our emphasis is on
cytoplasmic factors that regulate G protein signaling, which have been (and remain) understudied compared to
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the main activating inputs for trimeric G proteins. During the last grant
cycle, we made significant advances in this area by achieving all the originally proposed goals, thereby
establishing a new paradigm of G protein regulation. We demonstrated the existence of a family of cytoplasmic
activators of G proteins, dissected the structural basis for their molecular activity, and established the
consequences of their dysregulation in specific cellular processes and human diseases.
The specific goal of this renewal application is to characterize the prototype member of a potential new class of
G protein regulators that has been linked to chronic pain and epilepsy. The achievement of our goals would
provide deep mechanistic insights into a new paradigm of GPCR-G protein regulation that fine tunes inhibitory
neuromodulation, and establish a new framework to devise therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders
like chronic pain and epilepsy.
BACKGROUND: In the course of a screen of proteins that bind to Gαi subunits of Gα-Gβγ timeric complexes,
we identified a protein that regulates G proteins via a unique and novel mechanism. We have coined the term
“paradoxical G protein regulator” (PGR) to convey that it upregulates the modulation of some G protein
effectors while simultaneously downregulating the modulation of other G protein effectors. Loss of this “PGR” is
known to alter GPCR signaling in neurons of the peripheral nervous system and causes chronic pain. It has
also been linked to epilepsy. Despite its clear biomedical importance, the molecular mechanism by which this
G protein regulator operates, and how it modulates neurotransmission in the brain are completely unknown.
SYNOPSIS OF AIMS: Based on compelling preliminary data, we propose that the PGR modulates both Gαi-
and Gβγ-dependent signaling without directly affecting the G protein enzymatic activity (i.e., nucleotide binding
and/or hydrolysis), and that this novel mechanism fine tunes GPCR signaling in brain neurons to influence
seizure susceptibility. In Aim#1 we will dissect how the PGR regulates G proteins at the molecular level by
characterizing how it engages physically Gαi and the consequences of this physical engagement on G protein
signaling to different effectors. In Aim#2 we will characterize how it regulates GPCR signaling and
neurotransmission at the cellular level by using primary cultures of neurons and brain slices from wild-type and
KO mice. In Aim#3 we will determine the PGR's role at the physiological level by establishing how it impacts
seizure susceptibility using genetically modified mouse models."
10785413,"Abstract
The molecular processes of RNA transport and local translation are crucial in many aspects of
neuronal biology, including axonal growth and synaptic plasticity. Although some RNAs – such
as ACTB and ARC – have been well-studied and are known to be regulated in response to neural
activation, the underlying mechanisms governing them in space and in time are poorly understood.
RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of RNAs, involved in all aspects of RNA biology
from processing and nuclear export, to transport, translation, and degradation. Current estimations
are that over 2,000 genes in the mammalian genome encode for RBPs, however, the molecular
function of most of these predicted RBPs remains unknown. Understanding RBP function is
challenging due to the complexity of RBP-RNA interactions. A single RBP can interact with
thousands of target transcripts, and each transcript can be targeted by many RBPs. In addition,
RBP-RNA interactions are dynamic – the association and dissociation of an RBP from its target
can drive functional changes. This complex and dynamic nature suggest that RBPs do not function
in isolation and are rather forming higher-order complexes to exert their functions. Here, I
hypothesize that RBPs form functional ‘modules’, by interacting with each other directly or by
binding on the same RNA molecule and propose a novel approach to study RBPs using a network
perspective. I aim to characterize the network of RBP interactions and how it rewires following
neuronal activity, in attempt to define functional modules and to identify the most promising
candidate regulators. To do so, I propose to use a combination of approaches. One is an RNA-
centric approach, focusing on two well-studied RNAs, discovering the complement of RBPs that
bind them and comparing between them, followed by detailed follow-up experiments investigating
whether and how those RBPs affect the target RNA (Aim 1 – K99). The other, a protein-centric
global approach, studying RBP interactions in an unbiased manner and describing how they
change in response to stimulation, in order to define regulatory modules and to identify candidate
regulators for mechanistic follow up (Aim 2 – K99). The combined results of these studies will
shed light on the architecture of RBP interactions and will define modules, which will advance our
understanding of these crucial molecules and will set the stage to investigate their functions in
depth in my independent lab (aim 3 - R00)."
10789853,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Project Summary: Pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) is the most common lung cancer of childhood, now
known to be related to pathogenic variation in DICER1, a critical regulator of embryogenesis. Nearly all
clinically significant PPB is diagnosed in children under 7 years of age. Type I PPB is a purely cystic tumor with
a layer of primitive malignant cells. Type I PPB may progress to Type II PPB, a mixed cystic and solid tumor, or
Type III PPB, a highly aggressive, purely solid sarcoma. Children with Type I PPB are treated with surgery with
or without chemotherapy; however it is not clear which children require chemotherapy and which children can
be safely observed. Children with Type II or III PPB face an overall survival of only 74 and 53% respectively. In
Types I, II and III PPB, there is a need for risk stratification so that children with residual or progressive disease
can receive more intensive tumor-directed treatment and children with a favorable prognosis can be spared
unnecessary side effects. Since 1988, the International PPB Registry, based at Children’s Minnesota, has
been enrolling children with PPB in an effort to improve outcomes for this rare tumor. Our industrial partner,
ResourcePath, has developed DICER-Dx, a blood-based assay to detect DICER1hotspot circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA). We hypothesize that the unique molecular pathogenesis of DICER1-related tumors can be exploited
to facilitate tumor monitoring in PPB. This project focuses on 1) the clinical validation of novel ""liquid biopsy""
assays for sensitive detection and quantification of tumor burden in Types I, II and III PPB and 2) delivery of
current and future DICER1-related advances to children globally, leveraging our emerging partnership with
Beijing Children’s Hospital to increase accrual and accelerating successful completion of the proposed work.
 Relevance: These assays will apply to children and adults with DICER1-related cancers and improve upon
existing tumor monitoring while minimizing the risks of diagnostic radiation and sedation. DICER-Dx provides a
new way to measure DICER1-related cancer burden and response to therapy and therefore represents a
pioneering application of liquid biopsy technology in childhood cancer. These assays may be useful not only in
clinical practice, but also as companion diagnostics in preclinical drug development and clinical trials and will
be an essential component of future translational studies for the International PPB/DICER1 Registry.
Additionally, validation of these biomarkers is the next critical step in our efforts to develop ctDNA-based
biomarkers for use in healthy children and young adults with DICER1 pathogenic variation at elevated risk of
DICER1-related cancers."
10789862,"Project Summary/Abstract
Severe-to-profound hearing loss during infancy is a risk factor for poor spoken language development, even
after early cochlear implantation. A key to acquiring spoken language is developing the ability to learn
associations between words and their referents (i.e., novel word learning). Many young children with cochlear
implants (CIs) struggle to learn novel words and those who do tend to have poor language outcomes. We
know that successful word learning in normal-hearing, typically developing children depends in large part on
the real-time quantitative and qualitative properties of parent-child social interactions, such as the synchrony
between when parents name objects and children’s attention to those objects. Our central hypothesis is that
the atypical auditory experiences of CI users influence naming synchrony, affecting word-learning opportunities
and language outcomes. This proposed project is built upon an already established collaboration between MPI
Chen Yu, who has developed a multi-method, multi-modal approach involving high-resolution data of eye,
head, and hand movements to characterize the micro-structure of social coordination, and MPI Derek Houston,
who has investigated speech perception and novel word learning in children with cochlear implants for over 18
years. We will collect multiple streams of data from both parents and children as they play with each other and
as parents spontaneously name novel objects, and investigate the role of congenital deafness and subsequent
cochlear implantation on the quantity and quality of naming synchrony and explore potential micro- and macro-
level mechanisms that may account for differences in naming synchrony between dyads with NH children and
those with children who use CIs (Aim 1). We will also determine and the effects of naming synchrony on word
learning in CI users and NH children (Aim 2). Finally, the proposed project will assess language outcomes six
months later and determine the extent to which differences in naming synchrony predict language outcomes
after accounting for concurrent auditory processing and language abilities (Aim 3). To our knowledge, this is
the first effort to investigate real-time micro-level properties of social interactions in children with CIs, which will
lead to new insights into real-time parent-child interactions and language outcomes after implantation, and will
potentially lead to new hypotheses for intervention studies involving precise feedback on parent-child
coordination."
10789864,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our aims are focused on advancing current knowledge on the role of peripherin 2 (Prph2), also called retinal
degeneration slow (RDS), in outer segment (OS) rim and disc formation, and in understanding the pathogenic
mechanisms of PRPH2-associated disease. We use state-of-the-art technologies and our novel knockin
mouse models to learn 1) how different mutations in Prph2 lead to different disease phenotypes; 2) what
contributes to variability among patients carrying the same mutation; 3) what role the Prph2 partner, rod outer
segment membrane protein 1 (Rom1), plays in these events; and 4) how we can shift PRPH2-associated
severe phenotypes to milder ones. PRPH2 mutations lead to retinal diseases ranging from retinitis pigmentosa
(RP) to a variety of macular degenerations (MD) including pattern dystrophy (PD), which often associates with
secondary defects in neighboring tissues such as the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal/choroidal
vasculature. In spite of the scientific progress so far, a therapeutic option suitable for clinical testing has not
yet been developed. This disappointing outcome is further complicated by the diverse role of Prph2 in rods
versus cones, poor genotype-phenotype correlations, vast intrafamilial and interfamilial phenotypic variability,
the involvement of multiple tissues in the disease process, and the need for a precise dose of Prph2 to combat
the devastating effect of haploinsufficiency. Thus a thorough understanding of Prph2-associated disease
mechanisms, an absolute prerequisite for the development of effective therapies, requires precise knowledge
of the differential role of Prph2 in rods versus cones and the processes that link photoreceptor defects with
subsequent toxic effects in other tissues. Our findings suggest that rod-targeted disease (e.g. RP) arises due
to haploinsufficiency while cone-dominant diseases exhibit a more complex and variable pathology associated
with gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects. However, little is known about the link between these
primary defects in photoreceptors and the blinding secondary sequellae or about what causes intrafamilial
phenotypic heterogeneity. For the first time we have generated mouse models that will allow us to address
these questions. In addition, we have developed an outstanding team of investigators comprising recognized
field leaders in photoreceptor cell biology, with researchers skilled in understanding and evaluating choroidal
and retinal vasculature. Our preliminary data support the hypothesis that Rom1 is a key modifier in cases
where there is significant within-mutation disease variability. Aim1 will assess the role of Syn3B interactions
with Prph2/Rom1 and in OS trafficking. Aim 2 will evaluate mechanisms of diversity in Prph2-associated
disease phenotype. Aim 3 will address the role of Rom1 in modulating the disease pathology of Prph2
mutations. In summary, results from this application will facilitate our understanding of the role of Prph2 in rods
and cones in health and disease states. Outcomes from these studies will help direct therapeutic strategies to
overcome blindness associated with PRPH2."
10789865,"Anxiety disorders are the most common form of pediatric psychiatric illness, affecting up to 30% and severely
impairing up to 20% of all youth prior to age 18. Unfortunately, up to 50% of children remain symptomatic even
with the best available treatment, making anxiety disorders a major public health problem. A major barrier to
devising new treatments for anxiety disorders is that the brain pathophysiology likely starts at birth or earlier,
but little is known about the earliest stages of abnormal brain development. This proposal measures brain
activity and brain connectivity in neonates at high versus low risk for developing an anxiety disorder; uncovers
the first steps in the neurodevelopmental pathway that results in an anxiety disorder; and provides a framework
for early identification, prevention, and new treatment development. Anxiety disorders in adults are associated
with increased activity in brain networks that respond to changes in the environment or `novelty', coupled with
decreased activity in brain networks that regulate this novelty response. Behavioral and EEG data suggest that
these processes may start in infancy. Infants with an enduring enhanced behavioral and neural (as measured
by EEG) reaction to novelty are described as having the `behavioral inhibition (BI)' temperament and are at
high risk for later development of an anxiety disorder. High maternal prenatal anxiety is similarly associated
with both increased reactivity to novelty and increased risk for developing an anxiety disorder in offspring. The
objective of this application is to identify the specific brain networks in newborn infants that are associated with
this enduring enhanced response to novelty and that represent increased risk for later development of an
anxiety disorder. To achieve this objective, we will use task-based fMRI to measure regional brain activity that
is elicited by sudden, unexpected auditory stimuli (`oddballs') in sleeping neonates. Activity evoked by the initial
oddballs represents the initial novelty response, while activity evoked by later oddballs represents the potential
regulatory response. The central hypotheses are that neonates at high risk for developing an anxiety disorder
(on the basis of either high maternal anxiety or high BI) demonstrate increased activity in brain networks that
respond to novelty; coupled with decreased activity in regulatory networks after repeated presentation of the
stimuli. We will also use resting-state fMRI to measure network connectivity, and we predict that risk for anxiety
disorders will be associated with altered connectivity in networks that respond to novelty. We will test these
hypotheses by recruiting pregnant mothers and obtaining MRI in offspring (n=150) within 2 weeks of birth. We
will then assess the neonates and mothers at 3 additional visits over the first 2 years of life. We will assess
maternal anxiety during pregnancy with questionnaires and infant temperament in the first 2 years with
observational measures. Results may open new avenues for preventative measures in high-risk infants, such
as repeated exposure to new stimuli; or stimulation of problematic brain networks. Such measures would have
major public health impact, by preventing the most prevalent childhood psychiatric disorder."

translation initiation machinery eIF4EH activated by HIF2a and mediated by eIF4E2 alternative cap-binding. This
was essential for KSHV replication, for escaping the viral shut-off and for PDGFRA driven pathogenesis in MSCs.
The importance of this discovery is that through its regulation of the oxygen sensing machinery the
virus access to translation initiation plasticity, defined as the ability for KSHV to alternatively initiate
protein synthesis using both the initiation complex eIF4E bearing a cap-binding regulated by the PI3K-
AKT-mTOR -HIF1a (eIF4E1 cap-binding) axis or the eIF4EH (eIF4E2 cap-binding) regulated by the HIF2a.
We hypothesize that this provides the virus with several adaptive advantages that we will study: 1) Allows the
virus to maximize replication in different oxygen levels corresponding to variety of tissues and pathophysiological
conditions and it may allow the virus to bypass the stress and innate immunity-related kinases targeting eIF2a
inhibition 2) It may be employed by viral oncogenes such as vGPCR and/or by its host-cell signaling mediators
such as PDGFRA for proliferation and the induction of direct and paracrine oncogenesis 3) Could allow the
transformed host cell to be plastic and adaptive in the context of AIDS-KS therapies targeting PDGFRA such as
Imatinib, which are known to target the PDGFRA-AKT-mTOR-E1-HIF1a pathway. We will employ the MSC
based de novo oncogenesis to tumorigenesis models, an induction reactivation model and two natural infections
systems and AIDS-KS samples from different repositories to test these hypotheses. Aim 1: Study how KSHV
regulation of the oxygen sensing machinery (O2SM) leading to HIF2a activation of translational initiation by
eIF4EH contributes to KSHV replication and innate immunity evasion. Aim 2: Study mechanisms whereby KSHV
regulation of the oxygen sensing machinery leading to HIF2a activation of translational initiation by eIF4EH
contributes to KSHV oncogenesis in mouse MSC and human MSCs. Aim 3: Role of translation initiation plasticity
in mediating resistance to PDGFRA targeted therapies."

In the ten years since its first NICHD award in 2009, the Duke University Population Research
Center (DPRC) has grown into a vibrant, interdisciplinary research organization bringing
together scientists from the social and behavioral sciences and the biological, health, and
statistical sciences at Duke. We now have a network of population scientists whose interests
encompass health and well-being over the life course and extend to primate species as well as
humans, or who use social network analysis to model health, human development, and
demographic outcomes. New population science at DPRC is being generated by established
and early career scholars with diverse disciplinary backgrounds who have taken advantage of
the services of the Development Core to launch new, successful projects. DPRC's impact is
greatest in two primary research areas: (1) Foundations of Lifelong Health, and (2)
Interconnected Social Systems and Population Health. In pursuit of these questions, we
facilitate and promote (a) longitudinal data collections that follow cohorts from childhood and
reach across generations; (b) innovative data collection that rely on social connectivity to recruit
rare and hidden population samples or to map complete population networks; (c) the utilization
of linked administrative data that lengthen, broaden and deepen the view of life course health
and human development processes; and (d) the development of new tools and approaches for
“big” population and health science. This application requests renewal funding from the NICHD
Population Dynamics Centers Research Infrastructure (P2C) to support three cores—
administration, development and science. The proposed cores will lower administrative costs
while providing tools and technical support to create synergies and efficiencies in seeking,
securing and managing external funding that will free up and enable DPRC scholars to
concentrate on science. Our goal is to continue to increase external funding to develop science
that would not be possible without DPRC, by taking advantage of: (a) the number and quality of
population researchers at Duke; (b) our successful record of developing the next generation of
population scientists; (c) our unique data resources; (d) our proven track record of rigorous, high
impact science; (e) our collaborations with local and international academic institutions and
regional government partners to accelerate the impact of population studies on policy and
society."
10789909,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Collisions between the DNA replication and transcription machineries (replication-transcription conflicts) appear
to be common in eukaryotic cells. Although these conflicts have long been studied as a potential source of DNA
damage and, therefore, a threat to genome integrity, we lack a detailed molecular understanding of how the
presence of transcribing RNA polymerases on DNA affects the progress of replication, and of the mechanism(s)
by which these replication-transcription conflicts give rise to DNA damage.
Another consequence of transcription during DNA replication is elevated levels of ribonucleoside triphosphates
(rNTPS) – the substrate for RNA polymerases. Due to incomplete discrimination between rNTPs and dNTPs by
the replicative DNA polymerases, large numbers of ribonucleotides are mis-incorporated into the genome during
each round of replication; this burden is estimated at > 1 million ribonucleotides per cell division in human cells,
making ribonucleotides by far the most abundant lesion in eukaryotic DNA. Mis-incorporated ribonucleotides are
removed via the ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) pathway, and impaired removal is linked to several human
diseases. However, it is not known how ribonucleotides impact chromatin – the higher-order structure of DNA –
or conversely how chromatin affects RER. Furthermore, it has not been determined whether all ribonucleotides
are equally amenable to repair or what may underlie differences in RER efficiency through the genome.
The proposed work encompasses two ongoing projects:
The first project addresses how orientation-dependent effects on replication progression and genome integrity
arise at transcribed genes. To achieve this, we use a recently developed quantitative method to assay the
movement of the replisome genome-wide at high resolution, in combination with genome-wide interrogation of
DNA double-strand break formation and a novel assay to map nascent DNA strands in the context of an arrested
replication fork.
The second project uses a combination of genome-wide assays and in vitro biochemistry to delineate how
ribonucleotides destabilize nucleosomes (the basic repeating unit of chromatin), how nucleosomes affect RER
initiation by the RNase H2 enzyme, and to elucidate the dynamics of RER at all loci in the genome.
The machineries responsible for DNA replication, transcription, and DNA repair are highly conserved throughout
eukaryotes. Both projects will be carried out in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the small genome,
rapid replication, and genetic manipulability of S. cerevisiae make this an ideal model in which to study the
intersection of fundamental biological processes. Therefore, the results of this work will provide molecular
insights into genome instability in humans, and will be directly applicable to our understanding of the etiology
and progression of cancer as well as rare diseases including Aicardi-Goutières syndrome."
10790011,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) infants experience significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality due
to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection compared to HIV-unexposed (HUU) infants. Natural killer (NK) cells
and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are innate immune cells that play a critical role in controlling RSV infection.
We have previously identified abnormalities in NK cells and APCs from HEU infants, but it is not clear whether
these abnormalities explain the increased severity of RSV disease observed in this population. This research
seeks to address that knowledge gap and will also investigate which in utero exposures are responsible for
immune dysfunction in HEU infants. This research is relevant to the mission of the NICHD because it will advance
the understanding of immune cross-talk between the pregnant woman and fetus by studying the impact of
maternal HIV infection on neonatal innate immune function.
 The central hypothesis of this proposal is that in utero exposure to the inflammatory environment associated
with maternal HIV infection induces DNA methylation changes in innate immune cells that alter NK cell and APC
function, and ultimately impair the response to RSV infection. This hypothesis will be tested through the following
specific aims: 1) To compare the innate immune response to RSV infection between HEU and HUU infants using
an in vitro model of human respiratory infection; 2) To determine the effect of exposure to an environment
enriched in inflammatory cytokines on neonatal innate immune cell function; 3) To identify differences in DNA
methylation and RNA expression in NK cells and APCs between HEU and HUU infants and determine the effect
of in vitro cytokine exposure on the epigenetic and transcriptomic profile of these cells. Aim 1 will be investigated
using an innovative respiratory epithelial and endothelial co-culture system along with HEU and HUU cord or
peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In Aim 2, HUU NK cells and APCs will be incubated with inflammatory
cytokines to simulate HEU infants’ in utero conditions. Aim 3 will generate the first description of the epigenome
and transcriptome of HEU compared with HUU infants, using robust techniques including DNA methylation
arrays and single cell RNA sequencing.
 This approach is innovative because it: 1) allows the first investigation of the impact of HEU immune
dysregulation on RSV pathogenesis, and 2) may identify the mechanism for immune dysregulation in HEU
infants. This project is significant because it has potential to improve health outcomes for the more than 1 million
HEU infants born each year. Complimentary to the proposed research plan, a five-year mentored career
development training plan has been devised that incorporates didactic learning in genomic data analysis and
hands-on training in virology and immunology laboratory skills. The candidate is co-mentored by internationally
recognized experts in the fields of virology, immunology, and genomics/bioinformatics. The candidate’s long-
term career goal is to become an independent investigator studying the immune effects of HIV exposure."

The central nervous system (CNS) acquires its vasculature by angiogenesis, a process that is critical for its development and repair. Our findings have offered new perspectives on intrinsic regulation of angiogenesis and highlighted the importance of vascular diversity during brain development. Pre-formed vascular networks act as a template for the formation of the neocortex. They are strategically positioned, spatially and temporally to provide support and critical guidance cues to instruct key events of brain development. Recently, our studies uncovered a novel GABA signaling pathway in embryonic forebrain endothelial cells that works independently from neuronal GABA signaling. It revealed that disruptions in endothelial GABA signaling from early embryonic stages can directly contribute to the origin of psychiatric disorders including autism, epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety and depression. This vascular GABA signaling pathway extends into the postnatal phase with added complexities. Therefore, our renewal application will examine the key fundamental mechanisms of action of endothelial GABAA receptor-GABA signaling components during the postnatal period with new significance for neocortical development and disease. It aims at highlighting hitherto unknown mechanisms of endothelial GABA’s role in vascular regression and stabilization. It explores the novel concept that endothelial GABA components are indispensable for postnatal brain development and can differentially shape blood flow. Results will uncover fundamental mechanisms governing postnatal angiogenesis, offer new perspectives on the cellular and molecular landscape of the developing neocortex and will lead to discoveries with unprecedented implications for understanding and treatment of several neuropsychiatric illnesses."
10800691,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia. Atrial myopathy is a key determinant of the development
of AF. The molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of AF-promoting atrial myopathy are complex and
poorly understood. Innate inflammatory signaling including the ‘NLR family pyrin domain containing 3’ (NLRP3)
inflammasome pathway can modulate cardiac function and atrial arrhythmogenesis. Our preliminary study
revealed that NLRP3 inflammasome activity is enhanced in atrial cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) of persistent AF
patients compared with sinus rhythm controls. The CF-specific activation of NLRP3 in mice promotes the
development of atrial fibrosis, enlarged left atrium, reduced atrial contractility, abnormal impulse conduction,
sinus node dysfunction, and increased AF susceptibility, phenocopying atrial myopathy associated with AF
development. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that activation of CF inflammasomes enhances atrial
arrhythmogenesis by promoting atrial myopathy. Additionally, the therapeutic potential of enhancing the
resolution of inflammation to combat atrial myopathy and atrial arrhythmogenesis deserves evaluation. In this
proposal, we will also evaluate whether an inducer of inflammation resolution can prevent the inflammasome-
induced atrial myopathy, thereby reducing atrial arrhythmogenesis. This proposal addresses several
understudied areas in AF pathogenesis. The outcome of this study will provide novel insights into the
development of atrial myopathy and sinus node dysfunction, as well as provide rationale for using the pro-
resolution molecule in AF prevention."
10800692,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the 2nd most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Liver
transplantation (LT) is the only curative therapy for HCC patients with unresectable, non-metastatic disease who
meet strict radiologic tumor size and number criteria (Milan criteria). Eligible candidates undergo a finite
observation period (>6 months) that allows for an assessment of tumor biology, but which inherently risks HCC
progression and wait-list dropout in 15-20% of patients after 1 year. Despite these selection practices, post-LT
HCC recurrence plagues up to 20% of patients, and is a major cause of allograft loss and patient mortality. There
is a dire need for non-invasive biomarkers capable of dynamic monitoring of tumor biology to better balance the
risk of wait-list dropout and post-LT recurrence, and allowing for improved prioritization of HCC patients to receive
scarce liver allografts. This proposal aims to develop an integrated blood-based analysis (i.e., NanoVelcro
vimCTC Assay for detecting vimentin+ circulating tumor cells [CTCs] and HCC CTC-RNA Assay for HCC-
specific RNA signatures) for wait-listed HCC patients, to identify patients most suitable for LT. The integrated
assay will provide a novel approach to study both phenotypic and molecular characteristics of HCC CTCs.
 Using an HCC-specific multi-marker capture cocktail and optimized immunocytochemistry (ICC) staining
protocol, the proposed NanoVelcro vimCTC Assay is capable of identifying a subpopulation of HCC CTCs with
vimentin expression (named vimCTC, DAPI+/CK+/CD45-/vimentin+). This subpopulation is associated with
increased recurrence in the subset of clinically indistinguishable early-stage patients undergoing curative-intent
treatment. The HCC CTC-RNA Assay was developed by combining CTC isolation with Click Chip, featuring
click chemistry-mediated cell capture and disulfide-cleavage cell release, with downstream RNA expression
profiling of the purified CTCs with NanoString's nCounter platform. This allows for accurate quantification of a
panel of HCC CTC-derived mRNA markers in a non-invasive manner. The resulting vimCTC counts and mRNA
profiles hold great promise to augment the ability of the current LT candidate selection algorithm.
 The proposed research will be implemented via Specific Aim 1a: Conducting a retrospective study in banked
blood samples using NanoVelcro vimCTC Assay to refine the association between vimCTC counts and post-
LT recurrence/wait-list dropout.; Specific Aim 1b: Conducting a prospective study on freshly collected blood
samples to determine association between vimCTC counts and post-LT recurrence/wait-list dropout; and
Specific Aim 2: Conducting a prospective study on freshly collected blood samples to determine the association
between HCC CTC-RNA Assay and post-LT recurrence/wait-list dropout. The central hypothesis evaluated will
be that baseline and longitudinal changes in vimCTCs and aggressive RNA signatures will significantly improve
the ability of current clinicoradiologic LT selection criteria in predicting post-LT recurrence and wait-list dropout,
paving the way for tumor-biology based HCC LT candidate selection practices."
10819474,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human colon houses a complex community of microbes, known as the gut microbiota, which possesses unmapped
metabolic capabilities. Bacterial metabolic pathways process components of diet, like amino acids, and produce an array
of ill-defined metabolites. Many of the metabolites produced by this microbial ecosystem are absorbed by the human host,
modified by host enzymes, and ultimately excreted by the kidneys. When the kidneys fail, these solutes accumulate and
comprise a significant portion of the ""uremic"" solutes found at very high levels in the plasma of patients maintained on
dialysis. These compounds can vary widely between individual patients, yet are relatively stable over time within an
individual, potentially reflecting inter-individual differences in gut microbiota composition. A few of these molecules
have been investigated and linked to poor health outcomes in renal patients. For most of these compounds, however,
neither the biochemical pathways responsible for their formation nor their biological effects on the host have been
elucidated. This application is focused on the prevalent high concentration uremic solutes derived from tyrosine, 4-
ethylphenylsulfate (4-EPS) and p-cresolsulfate (PCS), as well as 4-hydroxyphenylpropionic acid sulfate, a tyrosine
metabolite not associated with uremia but important in understanding the tyrosine-utilization niche within the gut
ecosystem. The goals of the research are to (i) determine the genes and species within the gut microbiota responsible for
production of the microbial metabolites 4-ethylphenol and p-cresol that serve as precursors to 4-EPS and PCS; (ii)
elucidate the effects of these molecules on aspects of host biology relevant to uremic illness; and (iii) investigate two
distinct strategies for microbiota reprogramming with a goal of lowering uremic solute levels in a host. Aim 1 employs
two approaches to predict microbial metabolic pathways, one using a computational/machine learning approach and a
second method using comparative genomics combined with bacterial metabolomic phenotyping. Gene predictions will be
genetically validated using gene deletion or heterologous expression. In Aim 2, gnotobiotic mice are used as a platform to
investigate the conversion of microbial metabolites into circulating solutes, and how solute levels are affected by diet and
other members of the microbiota. Isotopically labeled amino acids are used to trace dietary substrates to uremic solute
products. Aim 3 leverages gnotobiotic mice colonized by WT versus mutant bacteria, which differ in the presence or
absence of 4-EPS or PCS, to examine the effect of the metabolite on host biology. Changes in arterial thrombosis and
cognitive function relevant to uremic illness will be assessed. The focus of Aim 4 is to reprogram the microbiota to reduce
production of harmful uremic solutes. Single strain targeted reprogramming or complex consortium-based microbiota
reconstitution using a diverse array of culturable bacteria will be tested as complementary strategies for lowering uremic
solute levels in mice. Dietary modifications or antibiotic-based ablation of the microbiota will be used to augment the
reprogramming therapies, respectively."

Herpes simplex type virus-1 (HSV-1) infects over 3.72 billion people worldwide, including 200 million individuals
in the United States. Following primary infection of the cornea, HSV-1 establishes latency in sensory neurons of
the trigeminal ganglia (TG). Reactivation of HSV-1 from latently infected TG leads to shedding of the virus in
tears causing recurrent ocular herpetic disease, a major cause of infectious blindness in the Western world.
Currenly, an FDA-approved herpes simplex vaccine is unavailable. Our long-term goal is to develop an
immunotherapeutic ocular herpes vaccine. While a role for CD8+ T cells (but not CD4+ T cells) in reducing HSV-
1 reactivations from latently infected TG is gaining wider acceptance, the small numbers of functional tissue-
resident memory CD8+ TRM cells that are present in latently infected TG are not enough to prevent virus
reactivation. We have made several significant findings, during the last funding period: (1) HSV-specific CD8+ T
cells from “naturally protected” HLA-A*0201-positive asymptomatic individuals (who never develop recurrent
ocular herpetic disease despite being infected) mainly targeted five HSV-1 epitopes; (2) Phenotypic and
transcriptomicprofiling indicates that frequent HSV-specific CD8+ TRM cells, which expressed high levels of
tissue-homing and tissue-residency receptors (i.e. CXCR3, IL-2R/IL-15R, CD69, and CD103), found in the TG
of HSV-1 infected HLA-A*0201 transgenic rabbits (HLA Tg rabbits) are associated with decreased virus
shedding; (3) Topical ocular delivery to latently infected HLA Tg rabbits of prototype neurotropic adeno-
associated virus (AAV8) constructs, which express either the T cell attracting CXCL11 chemokine (CXCR3
ligand) or IL-2/IL-15 cytokines (IL-2Rb/IL-15Rb ligands), increased the frequency of TG-resident CD8+ TRM cells
specific to the five immunodominant epitopes; (4) Increased numbers of exhausted TG-resident CD8+ TRM cells
were associated with increased virus shedding in HLA Tg rabbits; and (5) Ex vivo blockade of T cells exhaustion
pathways PD-1, LAG-3 and TIGIT, ex vivo, in rabbit TG explants significantly reduced virus reactivation. Building
on the above published and preliminary results, the central hypothesis of this revised competitive renewal
proposal is that a TG-targeted vaccine that boosts the number, function and longevity of anti-viral TG-resident
CD8+TRM cells will reduce virus reactivation and shedding. Specific Aims: Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that a
tissue-targeted Prime/Pull/Keep therapeutic vaccine (designated as PPK vaccine) that incorporates the five
immunodominant HSV-1 CD8+ TRM cell epitopes (prime), CXCL11 (pull) and IL-2/IL-15 (keep) will boost the
number and longevity of TG-resident CD8+ TRM cells and significantly decrease HSV-1 reactivation in latently
infected HLA Tg rabbits. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that tissue-targeted PPK vaccine combined with blockade
of PD-1, LAG-3 and/or TIGIT immune checkpoints will increase the number of functional CD8+ TRM cells in the
TG and produce even more robust protection in latently infected HLA Tg rabbits. This translational research is
expected to pave the way towards developing a PPK vaccine to protect against recurrent ocular herpes in man."
10819582,"Local protein synthesis enables distinct biological functions of subcellular compartments.
Neuronal axons are far apart from the cell body. Although thousands of mRNAs are present in
axons and dysfunctional axonal protein synthesis is linked to multiple disorders, our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the local protein synthesis in axons is
largely limited. Axon arborization plays a critical role in nervous system function because it defines
a territory for proper synaptic connection. The long-term goal is to elucidate the mechanisms that
govern localized protein synthesis and their role in axon arborization. The objective of current
application is to gain mechanistic insights on the role and the regulation of the cytoplasmic
polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB) in axonal protein synthesis and axon arborization
by using Drosophila as a model system. CPEB controls target protein translation through
cytoplasmic de- and poly-adenylation. Our preliminary studies support a model that a Drosophila
CPEB, Orb2 suppresses the protein synthesis of Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule
(Dscam) in the cell body through cytoplasmic deadenylation and mediates Dscam mRNA
transport to axon where Wallenda/Dual leucine zipper kinase (Wnd/DLK) de-represses the
translational suppression by Orb2. The newly developed innovative approach will be used to study
the following two aims. In Aim 1, the role of Orb2 in axonal Dscam protein synthesis will be
determined. In Aim 2, the regulatory mechanism of Orb2 by Wnd will be studied. The physiological
role of identified mechanisms will be determined using axon arborization in vivo. Orb2/CPEB is
important for long-term memory formation. Dscam is implicated in multiple brain disorders.
Wnd/DLK plays a key role in multiple neuronal events. Therefore, the contribution will be
significant because it will provide a novel role of Orb2/CPEB in axonal protein synthesis, a novel
axonal protein synthesis regulation by Wnd/DLK, and a mechanism of Dscam expression and
localization in axons. The expected outcome is the novel molecular regulatory mechanisms in
axonal protein synthesis and their role in axon arborization. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms of axonal protein synthesis and arborization will ultimately help developing effective
treatment to brain disorders."

10820483,"Title: Impact of Genetic and Pharmacological Kynurenine Pathway Suppression on Healthspan,
Lifespan and Cellular Changes Associated With Aging in Mice
PROJECT SUMMARY/ASTRACT (30 LINES OF TEXT)
Through findings from translational studies on both aged and chronically inflamed mice, as well as on aged
and frail older adults, we have identified metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (KP) as potential mediators of
systemic damage caused by chronic inflammation. We recently identified that KP metabolites including
kynurenine, kynurenic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid were significantly elevated in the serum of
older mice and robust and frail older adults, and that this was linked to functional decline and
neurodegeneration. The family of molecules known as `kynurenines' are derived from the amino acid
tryptophan and are precursors for the important electron carrier and coenzyme molecule NAD+. Kynurenines
possess unique bioactive properties and some have pathological potential. For example quinolinic acid (QA)
and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) are neuro- and cytotoxic and induce oxidative stress while kynurenine (KYN)
and kynurenic acid (KA) are ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), whose signaling activity is linked
to immunosuppression, senescence and impaired autophagy. Conversely, genetically inhibiting the KP extends
lifespan in C. elegans and Drosophila, and pharmacological KP blockade increases lifespan in Drosophila.
Reduced dietary tryptophan extends lifespan in rodents, but it is unknown if genetic or pharmacological KP
blockade improves healthspan or extends lifespan in mice. In this study, we aim to evaluate the hypothesis that
genetically and pharmacologically suppressing levels of KP metabolites can delay functional decline,
pathophysiological metabolic changes, mortality and cellular changes associated with aging in mice. To
understand the effects of KP suppression on aging, we will determine the effect of suppressing the oxidative
stress inducing kynurenines, 3-HK and QA, using kynurenine 3-monooxygenase knock out mice (KMO -/-, Aim
1). We will also determine the effect of suppressing both oxidative stress inducing kynurenines, 3-HK and QA,
as well as AhR agonist kynurenines, KYN and KA using the indolamine 2,3 dioxygenase knockout mouse (Ido
-/-, Aim 2). We will then determine if pharmacological suppression of toxic kynurenines and AhR ligands can
delay aging in mice using 1-methyltryptophan (Aim 3). Additionally, we will determine if pairing all of these KP
suppression strategies with NAD+ supplementation will synergistically benefit healthspan, lifespan and
characteristics of aging in mice. These studies will inform on the role of the KP in functional decline and aging
and the therapeutic potential of KP suppression as an anti-aging intervention."

The objective of this training program (the Biomedical Neuroscience Training Program) is to
develop and train basic and clinical scientists to understand the biology of the brain and mind
and to be well versed in current therapies for psychiatric illness. The trainees are presented
with a program that allows them to do research in a number of laboratories studying anything
from the molecular and cellular biology of neurons to imaging of the brain in psychiatric patients.
This comprehensive program allows trainees to develop novel experimental approaches to both
discovery and therapy. The Biomedical Neuroscience Training Program also instills skills
necessary to help clinical trainees more effectively research the diagnosis, treatment and
prevention of psychiatric disease. Our challenge is to integrate molecular and cellular
neurobiology with higher order systems so that the confluence between brain and mind can be
better understood.
Trainers have been carefully selected to provide an environment where basic and clinical
trainees will enrich each other's experience and learn to work together in the spirit of truly
translational research. These trainers are housed in several departments within the College of
Medicine (as well as a few in the College of Arts and Sciences and Pharmacy) at UIC, but are
committed to the training program as a single entity. Candidates are a mix of graduate students
(both PhD and MD/PhD) and postdoctoral fellows (both psychiatry residents and clinical
psychology fellows). Thus, in addition to research training, a specific goal of the program is to
train psychiatrists/psychologists to engage in research and to excite basic scientists about the
possibility of a career in translational neuroscience. Furthermore, those doing basic
neurobiology become attuned to the implications of their research for mental health. The
program also supports a series of colloquia expected to deliver current data and speculation
about both basic and clinical neuroscience. Finally, it is emphasized that a strength of this
program is its ability to recruit and train underrepresented minorities and to bring them into the
ranks of researchers in neurobiology, psychiatry and clinical psychology. This program is
committed to the principle that ALL trainees benefit from diversity.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is an oral- and aero-antigen mediated allergic disease of increasing prevalence
and incidence. EoE is characterized by esophageal fibrosis, rigidity, and smooth muscle hypertrophy, resulting
in food impactions and strictures, vomiting, poor appetite, failure to thrive, and dysphagia. Chronic Th2-type
inflammation of the esophagus in EoE can lead to fibrosis and other features of tissue remodeling that induce
esophageal narrowing and associated food impactions and dysphagia. Current EoE treatments include antigen
elimination diets and topical corticosteroids that can limit inflammation, but these measures may not control
disease long term or reverse the course of esophageal remodeling and dysfunction. Our current lack of
therapies that can halt or reverse EoE associated remodeling creates a pressing need for therapies since
approximately 50% of patients have treatment resistant disease or inflammation that recurs despite ongoing
therapy. In the first cycle of this grant, we demonstrated the presence of the TNF superfamily member,
TNFSF14/LIGHT in all T cell subsets in the active EoE esophagus. Further, we demonstrated that esophagus
fibroblasts were a major target of LIGHT, expressing both receptors (LTR and HVEM) for this cytokine. LIGHT
induced differentiation of pathogenic and remodeling fibroblasts with increased pro-inflammatory gene
transcription and the ability to interact with human eosinophils dependent on both its receptors. The role of
LIGHT in EoE was also supported by studies in a robust murine EoE model where the absence of LIGHT
protected from esophagus remodeling. New novel data from our labs suggests that the there is a complex and
concerted action of several cytokines in the TNF superfamily in EoE that includes not only LIGHT but also
TNFSF12/TWEAK. TWEAK and its receptor TNFRSF12A/Fn14 are induced in the active EoE esophagus.
TWEAK and LIGHT induce both unique and overlapping inflammatory fibroblast transcriptional phenotypes
with TWEAK having substantive effects on myofibroblasts. Based on our new data that LIGHT, TWEAK, IFN,
and IL-13 are co-expressed in esophageal T cells, that LIGHT and TWEAK interact functionally with IFN and
IL-13 to induce fibroblast inflammatory and remodeling gene expression, and that their receptors are
expressed in esophageal tissue from EoE patients and co-expressed on esophageal fibroblasts, we propose to
test the hypothesis that LIGHT, TWEAK, and their receptors orchestrate EoE remodeling by inducing pro-
inflammatory and pro-remodeling fibroblasts. We utilize primary human esophageal cells, tissues, and
biopsies, from normal and EoE patients, as well as murine models of allergic esophagitis with gene-deficient
whole animal and fibroblast-specific Fn14 and LTR deficient mice. Pre-clinical therapeutic blocking strategies
will inform the concerted action of TWEAK and LIGHT and their interactions with IL-13 and INF in EoE
remodeling. These studies may lead to new and novel targets for therapeutic intervention in EoE."

 Because the early detection of lung cancer by low-dose CT (LDCT) can reduce the mortality,
annual LDCT screening is now being reimbursed by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services

discover indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs). 4% of PNs are early-stage lung cancers, while
the remaining 96% are benign. Therefore, LDCT has over-diagnosis. There is an unmet need for
a reflex test for LDCT follow-up to focus care on the 4% smokers need it. The objective of this

to ensure brain health and associated optimal psychosocial functioning. Moreover, such personalized
care strategies would also be expected to decrease risk for negative outcomes like suicide. Based on
increased risk for suicide among both younger and older cohorts of Veterans, suicide prevention
remains the highest clinical priority within the VHA. One solution to overcoming existing data and
clinical challenges is the integration of existing data sets focused on both clinical outcomes (e.g.,
PTSD symptom severity) and physiologic biosignals/functional measures (e.g., electroencephalogram
[EEG] activity, computerized posturography, computerized eye tracking). Such an approach would
allow the application of advanced analytic techniques to develop algorithms (e.g., diagnostic,
prognostic) that can be used to promote brain health among Veterans with co-occurring mTBI and
mental health sequelae (e.g., PTSD). To carry this out, members of this team with significant
expertise in mental health and suicide prevention will collaborate with other teams engaged in the
Total Brain Diagnostics (TBD) Proof of Concept linked submissions. As a first step, we will create a
unified/harmonized dataset of measures collected as part of the Long-Term Impact of Military Brain
Injury (LIMBIC) and Translational Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) protocols.
Based on LIMBIC and TRACTS longitudinal data collection, clinical and physiologic
biosignals/functional measures will be available. The goal of this mental-health focused TBD
submission will be to explore associations between physiologic measures and mental health
outcomes, including depression, anxiety, substance/alcohol use, PTSD, and suicidal thoughts and
behaviors. Specific efforts will focus on identifying key objective, functional physiologic measures
within the harmonized longitudinal dataset which predict: 1) the presence of mental health
outcomes/conditions (e.g., symptoms, suicidal thoughts and behaviors) after combat-related mTBI;
and 2) distinct trajectories of mental health outcomes/conditions (e.g., symptoms, suicidal thoughts
and behaviors) post-combat-related mTBI. Study Aims are as follows: Aim 1. Work with the LIMBC-
TRACTS harmonization team to construct and become familiarized with the unified dataset. Aim 2.
Identify one or more uniform analytic approaches (e.g., machine learning) to facilitate analysis of this
unified dataset. Aim 3. Analyze the impact of physiological biosignals/functional indicators on the
longitudinal trajectory of mental health symptoms and conditions. Aim 4. Collaborate with behavioral
and biomarker measure experts to conduct multimodal factor analyses. A key project deliverable is
the development of the LIMBC-TRACTS combined data set. Initial findings from this proposed effort
will be foundational for subsequent inquiry focused on enhancing diagnostic and prognostic efforts to
improve brain health and psychosocial functioning among Veterans living with mTBI and mental
health conditions."

Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are causally linked to 5% of all human cancers, including nearly all cervical
cancers and ~25% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), largely driving an ongoing epidemic
increase of HPV-positive (HPV+) HNSCCs over recent decades. However, little is known about the mechanisms
of disease progression driven by HPV, particularly in the context of host immunity. Based on our preliminary
findings, we will study the mechanism by which the chemokine CXCL14 suppresses HNSCC growth, and test if
CXCL14 serves as a useful immunomodulatory target for novel immunotherapies to treat HPV+ HNSCC.
Recently, we have revealed that restoring the suppressed expression of CXCL14 in HPV+ HNSCC cells greatly
suppressed tumor growth in immunocompetent syngeneic mice through upregulation of MHC-I antigen
presentation and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells responses. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that CXCL14
induces antitumor immune responses that suppress HPV+ HNSCC by enhancing antigen presentation and
eliciting CD8+ T cell responses, and thus CXCL14 is a potential novel immunotherapeutic agent. To test our
hypothesis, we will 1) Define the mechanisms by which CXCL14 upregulates MHC-I antigen presentation to
mediate tumor suppression; 2) Define the mechanisms by which CXCL14 induces CD8+ T cell
infiltration/activation and tumor suppression; and 3) Test CXCL14-based immunotherapies that induce antitumor
immunity and clear HPV+ HNSCC. Our study will provide new mechanistic understanding of antitumor immune
defenses in HPV+ HNSCC and may lead to a novel immunotherapy for HNSCC, particularly for the non-
responders in current immunotherapies."
10804917,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
The exocrine pancreas of patients with type 1 diabetes is smaller than the pancreas of healthy subjects and
shows histological anomalies such as fibrosis, fatty degeneration, inflammatory cell infiltration and
atherosclerosis. The histological features associated with diabetes are so specific that they have been defined
as a distinct entity called diabetic exocrine pancreatopathy, which can be readily distinguished from chronic
pancreatitis. The prevalence is high: 35 to 77% of adult patients with type 1 diabetes present with pancreatic
exocrine dysfunction. Multiple etiological factors have been proposed, but it is inescapable that type 1 diabetes
is defined by the autoimmune attack destroying the beta cells. Our goals are (a) to understand how the beta
cell coordinates pancreas function and (b) to determine how the progressive demise of the beta cell impacts
this coordination. In preliminary studies, we found that local insulin signaling affects the function of the acinar
tissue and the islet microvasculature. We thus propose that locally delivered insulin orchestrates pancreas
function by acting on three functional effectors: (1) adjacent acinar tissues, (2) vascular units comprised of
pericytes and endothelial cells, and (3) intrapancreatic neurons that provide local cholinergic input. We
hypothesize that beta cell control of these effectors deteriorates during the progression of T1D, leading to
inadequate coordination of pancreas activity. The long term loss of this coordination produces pathological
sequelae across compartments. The rationale for the proposed research is that if we want to develop therapies
it is imperative to elucidate the mutual interactions and mechanism that promote the disease state. The
proposed research is therefore relevant to the mission of the NIH that pertains to the pursuit of fundamental
knowledge about beta cell function and its demise in diabetes. Guided by strong preliminary data, our
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims (1) Determine the impact of insulin on exocrine tissue
function during diabetes development, (2) Determine the impact of insulin on the pancreatic microvasculature,
and (3) Determine how insulin impacts neural coordination of pancreas function. We will determine the trophic
role of insulin by manipulating insulin signaling and measuring the structural and functional consequences in
exocrine, vascular, and neural compartments. The manipulation will be performed in the mouse in vivo, using
genetic tools or in diabetes models. We will study the healthy and the diseased state in the human pancreas by
using living pancreas slices provided by the network of pancreatic organ donors. The proposed research is
significant because it could generate mechanistic insight into how beta cells influence surrounding tissues to
coordinate activity across pancreas compartments. By identifying the effectors and principles governing this
local regulation, we will be able to understand how the progressive loss of beta cell function produces
pathological changes across pancreas compartments in people with type 1 diabetes."
10808130,"Acute intoxication with toluene (Tol) constitutes a worldwide public health problem. Human and animal data
demonstrate that acute Tol intoxication is associated with brain hypoperfusion. The decrease in blood flow is a
significant determinant of Tol-induced long-term neurological deficits and catastrophic acute scenarios, including
death. Remarkably, the biological targets and mechanisms underlying Tol-induced reduction in cerebral
perfusion are unknown. Our preliminary data from rat and mouse show that, consistent with hypoperfusion,
acute exposure to intoxicating concentrations of Tol leads to cerebral artery constriction both in vitro and in live
animals. Thus, we will cover the current knowledge gap in neurovascular toxicology by departing from all
previous work, which focused on Tol effects on central neuron ion channels, to address this overarching
hypothesis: constriction of cerebral arteries by acute Tol exposure is primarily due to drug inhibition of
potassium channels of the BK type present in the arterial smooth muscle (SM) itself. This drug action is
determined by distinct sensing of Tol by the two BK subunits that give rise to the SM BK phenotype: channel-
forming cbv1, which enables drug action through its cytosolic tail domain, and the SM-abundant, regulatory β1,
which downregulates Tol actions on both channel and cerebral artery function. We will address three
conceptually related, yet independently testable specific aims (SA): SA1 (phenomenology) will establish that
Tol at levels reached in blood and brain during acute intoxication constricts cerebral arteries independently of
Tol systemic metabolism, circulating or endothelial factors but by primarily inhibiting BK, which only requires
the two SM BK subunits in a bare lipid environment. SA2 (mechanism of drug action) will identify the specific
roles of cbv1, β1, and allosteric gating processes that determine Tol action on BK activity and cerebral artery
diameter. SA3 (translational aspects) will prove that naturally occurring variations in β1 levels determine the
differential vulnerability of brain arterial branches to Tol-induced constriction, whereas this subunit can be used
as therapeutic target of selective small agents to counteract Tol action on brain vessels. To test the proposed
aims, we will use a multidisciplinary approach that includes Tol vapor exposure paradigms and a cranial
window in vivo, in vitro myogenic tone determinations, novel and selective pharmacological tools,
engineered mice, recombinant DNA and engineered BK subunits, electroporation of tissues with foreign
cDNAs, biotinylation and Western blotting, lipid bilayer and patch-clamp electrophysiology, and allosteric
gating analysis. We expect to unveil the cellular targets and molecular mechanisms that mediate Tol-
induced cerebrovascular constriction and to deliver new selective pharmacological tools for early intervention in
Tol-induced brain ischemia, while having minor side effects in other organs."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) are two highly-associated metabolic disorders. It is well-documented that African Americans are 60% more likely to develop T2D than non-Hispanic whites. Multiple factors contribute to these disparities, including biological and clinical factors, as well as health system and social factors. However, available evidence of environmental factors are not enough to explain this significant T2D disparities between African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Our database mining identified a sequence variant (rs142619613) within the coding region of YY1 gene (Yin Yang 1). rs142619613 occurs mainly in African Americans. This nucleotide variant (G-C) leads to Glu47Asp missense mutation, which significantly increased stability and transcriptional activity of YY1. We further established YY1 as a transcription activator of miR-23b/27b/24. MiR-23b/27b/24 selectively drove AKT phosphorylation but prevented phosphorylation of FOXO1, thereby promoting de novo lipogenesis (DNL) and gluconeogenesis. Phenotypically, antagonizing miR-23b/27b/24 alleviated hepatic insulin resistance, hepatosteatosis, hyperglycemia and MASH. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that rs142619613, by augmenting the YY1-miR-23b/27b/24 axis, selectively drives phosphorylation of AKT and prevents phosphorylation of FOXO1, thereby shifting the metabolic program of the liver towards increased gluconeogenesis and DNL and exacerbating hepatic insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and hepatosteatosis. The objective of this R56 project is to elucidate the role of miR-23b/27b/24 in promoting MASH development and evaluate the effect of rs142619613 on lipid and glucose homeostasis in human hepatocytes. Our long-time goal is to explain the higher incidence of T2D and MAFLD in African Americans and develop YY1 and miR-23b/27b/24 as potential therapeutic targets against both conditions. Two specific aims are designed to test our hypothesis in this R56 project. In Aim 1, we will establish the role of miR-23b/27b/24 in promoting hepatic inflammation and fibrosis and evaluate the impacts of miR-23b/27b/24 knockdown and liver-specific expression of Wwc1 on food intake, body weight, glucose homeostasis, and lipid homeostasis. Completion of this aim will establish gain-of miR-23b/27b/24 in promoting MASH. In Aim 2, we will assess the role of rs142619613 in disrupting lipid and glucose homeostasis in human hepatocytes. Understanding how T2D and MAFLD develops is of critical importance to design therapeutic strategies to combat both chronic illness. The results will provide novel insights into the mechanisms of the higher prevalence of T2D in African Americans, which may lead to rational therapeutic strategies for T2D."

Project 2: Genesis and dynamics of human endometrial resident memory T cells revealed by uterus
transplant recipients
Most T cells in the human body are located within individual tissues as antigen-experienced, resident memory T
cells (TRM). However, much of the scientific knowledge about human T cells has been generated from studies of
peripheral blood and secondary lymphoid organs where most T cells are naive. Unfortunately, many of the
lessons learned from T cells in peripheral blood may therefore not apply to tissue resident immune cells because
tissue environments shape immune cell differentiation and responses in ways that do not occur in other anatomic
compartments. We therefore lack the knowledge necessary to manipulate tissue resident cells to our advantage
to treat a variety of diseases and patient populations. Tissue resident memory T cells are an antigen-experienced,
adaptive immune population that play a critical role in protective immunity to pathogens. We address this
knowledge gap in this proposal through the study of TRM in the human uterine endometrium. Notably, TRM
recruitment, composition, and longevity may be distinctly different in the human endometrium versus other
tissues because the endometrium undergoes hundreds of cycles of coordinated tissue loss and regeneration
over the course of a lifetime. We have combined cutting-edge next generation sequencing methodologies with
access to the endometrium of healthy control volunteers and human uterus transplant recipients to answer
questions about TRM trafficking and differentiation that will advance our understanding of human tissue immunity.
We expect that this proposal will have particular impact for women's health and transplant recipients but may
also inform vaccine strategies and cancer therapeutics as well. In summary, we expect that the knowledge
generated by this proposal can be used to expand our capabilities to modulate the human immune system and
treat a variety of human diseases."
10797063,"ABSTRACT
Liver is the major hub that is responsible for regulating both plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels as it is
involved in their synthesis, secretion, and clearance. Several studies have reported that any errors in these
processes will lead to metabolic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hypercholesterolemia.
Hypercholesterolemia will eventually result in atherosclerosis that is the leading cause of death in US. Also,
plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels are highly heritable and several human genome-wide association
studies have identified hundreds of genetic loci that could control the levels of these plasma lipids. Unfortunately,
only a small number of these loci have been translated into a gene target and validated through experimental
studies. Therefore, there is a critical need for identifying and validating novel biologically causal candidate genes
that could serve as a therapeutic target. To this end, we used an integrative genomics approach in a panel of
diverse inbred strains of mice to integrate information on natural genetic variations (genomics) with molecular
phenotypes (transcriptomics) and clinical phenotypes (phenomics) and identified a liver gene, liver pyruvate
kinase (L-PK), in regulating hepatic steatosis via mitochondrial involvement. When L-PK was downregulated,
both insulin sensitivity and liver triglyceride levels improved, while L-PK overexpression overloaded the
mitochondrial function, augmenting the disease condition. More importantly, all these observations were made
in male but not female mice. Serendipitously, we also reported that L-PK was associated with regulating plasma
cholesterol levels. Over the next five years, we aim to mechanistically dissect this relationship and their
underlying pathways in a sex-specific manner. The studies proposed in this application aim to address this by
using a combination of an array of experimental approaches including gonadectomy, lipidomic, metabolomic,
transcriptomic and bioenergetic studies, and a novel humanized hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis animal
model. We propose to determine which of the cellular mechanisms (cholesterol synthesis, secretion, and
clearance) are altered by L-PK in altering plasma cholesterol levels and finally, test the hypothesis that L-PK
regulates hyperlipidemia-induced atherosclerosis in a sex-specific manner (Aim 1), and determine the sex-
specific signaling pathways (AR and PTEN-PI3K-AKT signaling) altered by L-PK in mediating this phenomenon
(Aim 2). Upon completion of this grant, we will be able to define how L-PK reprograms cholesterol metabolism,
thereby influencing atherosclerosis progression in a sex-specific manner. Ultimately, this information will aid in
identifying personalized therapeutic implications of L-PK in hypercholesterolemia."
10797271,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 8 million people with diabetes are hospitalized each year in the United States.
Hospitalized patients with uncontrolled diabetes have a disproportionate risk for poor hospital
outcomes. Current strategies using multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin often fail to improve
glycemic control. Recent trials have shown that adding continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to
MDI may have a positive but modest impact on inpatient glycemic control. While high quality
European studies from a single research group have shown improvement in glycemic control
with automated insulin delivery (AID), several questions remain about reproducibility,
sustainability, dissemination, and scalability. First, the use of expensive insulin pumps with
tubing is not ideal for the hospital (potential infection transmission if used in multiple patients,
reduced mobility, and cost concerns); second, the role of hospital staff in the use of AID has not
been defined; third, methods for confirmation of CGM accuracy and electronic health records
(EHR) documentation are not established; fourth, remote insulin delivery and remote AID and
glucose monitoring has not been tested in the hospital (relevant for patients under isolation
precautions); fifth, there is a need for regimens for heterogenous populations usually excluded
from clinical trials (e.g. type 1 diabetes, steroid-induced diabetes). The Automated Insulin
Delivery in Inpatients with Dysglycemia (AIDING) trial, informed by a recently completed
feasibility pilot study, will address these questions in a multicenter randomized clinical trial (Aim
1). A heterogenous adult population with diabetes requiring insulin therapy will be randomly
assigned to AID with remote real-time CGM or to MDI plus CGM. Patients in the intervention
arm will wear a disposable single-user patch pump capable of remote insulin delivery. Sensor
glucose values will be documented in the EHR with periodic confirmation of accuracy and will be
monitored remotely by nursing staff and the study team to detect potentially dangerous
hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic episodes. The primary endpoint is time spent in target glucose
range (70-180 mg/dL). Safety will be assessed by time spent in hypoglycemia (<54mg/dL). In
Aim 2, we will conduct a mixed-methods evaluation (surveys and semi-structured interviews) to
examine additional infrastructure needs and factors that influence the adoption of inpatient AID
among end-users (i.e., study participants, nursing staff) and relevant hospital staff stakeholders.
This approach will facilitate the creation of standardized care and implementation algorithms to
facilitate sustainability and scalability of inpatient technology use to other health systems and at-
risk populations."
10917304,"Project Summary/Abstract
The broad, long-term objectives of this proposal are two-fold: 1) to provide high-quality mentoring to contribute
to the career development of trainees from diverse backgrounds and 2) to advance the quality, rigor and
breadth of health equity research in transplantation and pediatric nephrology.
For decades, it has been recognized that Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to receive kidney transplantation
compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), especially from a living donor. Most published disparities studies
have used race/ethnicity as a social construct and attributed differences in transplant access and outcomes to
social determinants of health (SDOH). Yet, assessments of SDOH are often limited to race/ethnicity, health
insurance status and neighborhood poverty level, and most studies are descriptive with few providing
actionable findings to mitigate inequities. Further, proposed interventions are often targeted at the individual
patient rather than the healthcare systems that perpetuate systemic racial bias. Another challenge in achieving
equity in transplant access lies in the limits of national data. Currently, national surveillance registries capture
patients when they begin renal replacement therapy (United States Renal Data System) and when they are
waitlisted or transplanted (Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients), but not what happens during the time in
between when patients must undergo transplant referral and evaluation to be deemed transplant eligible.
Given this context, the transplant community has asserted a call to action to achieve equity in transplantation
by improving rigor, quality and transparency in transplant-related health equity research. Dr. Amaral’s research
proposal seeks to move from describing disparities to achieving equity in transplant access and outcomes
through research that leverages diverse study designs and varied data sources to identify potentially
modifiable healthcare system barriers to transplant access. Two current projects will support this award. The
REACH-TRANSPLANT study (R01 DK120886) examines racial/ethnic inequities that arise during recipient and
living donor (LD) evaluation, LD selection, and LD follow-up. The study has three aims and applies both
primary and secondary data collection, large electronic health records, research cohort data and survey data.
The second project, The House Calls Project, focuses on identifying and addressing adverse social
determinants of health (SDOH) that interfere with pediatric kidney transplant evaluation completion. This study
will use interview and survey data. These studies provide robust training opportunities in health equity research
for Dr. Amaral as a mentor and for mentees across many levels and background, making this proposal ideally
aligned with the overarching goals of the K26 award mechanism."

Osteoarthritis (OA), a disease associated with cartilage damages inside the joints, affects millions of people
every year. The current medicines, including analgesics and anti-inflammation drugs only alleviate symptoms
but do not cure the disease while surgical methods to use replacement cartilage auto- or allo-grafts struggle with
the problems of infection, donor-site morbidity, immune-rejection and limited tissue supply. In this regard,
regenerative engineering approaches which are based on biomaterial scaffolds, stem cells and biological growth
factors to construct artificial replacement cartilage tissues have become an important field. While growth factors
are powerful, these chemicals pose a significant concern regarding to their toxic and side effects. Alternatively,
electrical stimulation (ES) has been known to exhibit a significant effect on promoting bone and cartilage growth.
As bioelectricity is an intrinsic physiological signal of living organisms, the use of ES presumably, offers a more
natural approach for inducing cartilage growth. However, while extracorporeal electrical stimulators are not
effective, implanted devices rely on toxic batteries, requiring invasive surgery for removal, which can easily
damage the healing tissues. In this regard, we have developed a novel biodegradable piezoelectric nanofiber
scaffold, made of PLLA (Poly-L-lactide) and shown that this scaffold can self-generate ES under applied joint
force to heal cartilage defects in small animal models. Yet remaining important questions still need to be
addressed. These questions are (1) what the optimal stimulation and the best piezoelectric biodegradable
scaffold are for cartilage healing and (2) whether the scaffold with physical exercise can heal the major cartilage
defects in large animals. Here, we propose, for the first time, a new biodegradable piezoelectric
nanocomposite cartilage-graft (containing PLLA and magnesium oxide – MgO nanoparticles), and study
an optimal physical-exercise to obtain a novel regenerative approach which can heal critical-sized
cartilage defects in large animals. Accordingly, the work is designed with three specific aims; Aim 1 is to
characterize the proposed biodegradable piezoelectric composite scaffold in vitro to obtain a good replacement
cartilage graft. Aim 2 is to study and assess optimal physical exercise (duration, frequency, and intensity) and
optimal composite scaffolds for the best healing of cartilage defects in rabbits. Aim 3 is to study and demonstrate
cartilage healing in large animal model (sheep). The first milestone (in 1.5 years) is to find out the best
piezoelectric scaffold with desired properties in vitro. The second milestone after 3.5 years is to find out the
optimal physical training and scaffold to heal cartilage defects in rabbits. The final milestone (after 5 years) is to
demonstrate the ability of the MgO/PLLA scaffold with derived optimal joint load (N/m2) and treadmill training to
heal critical-sized cartilage defects in sheep."

10811666,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies of psychiatric disease have repeatedly linked risk for schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder to noncoding regions that are in or near genes relevant in synaptic organization, including an
interval in the third intron of the gene CACNA1C, which encodes the pore-forming subunit of a pan-neuronal
postsynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel. As these variants are located in noncoding DNA, they do not alter
the subsequent amino acid sequence of the protein. Rather, many of the risk variants are expected to be
expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) of synaptic genes, and it is most likely that the risk-containing
sequences are enhancers that regulate transcription of a targeted synaptic gene. This adds to a wide body of
research that have identified schizophrenia and bipolar disorder as “disorders of the synapse.” However,
though there is strong evidence linking the risk eQTLs and synaptic organization, the nature of this relationship
is unclear. In this project, I aim to test the hypotheses that (1) non-coding psychotic disorder risk eQTLs of
synaptic genes are enhancers during juvenile or adolescent cortical synaptic development and (2) risk-
associated sequence variation in high-priority enhancers in CACNA1C disrupts the cell-type specific ability of
the sequence to act as an enhancer during cortical synaptogenesis. I will test the first hypothesis by conducting
a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) of candidate genomic enhancers that contain eQTLs that
contribute transdiagnostic risk for bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in vivo during cortical synaptogenesis in
mice. I will conduct this MPRA at two time points representing juvenile (P7) and adolescent (P56) synaptic
developmental processes. These experiments will allow me to determine the functional role of top psychotic
disorder-associated risk regions across development during mammalian cortical synaptogenesis. I will also test
for allelic effects, which may allow me to identify eQTLs whose risk allele has a strong effect on transcriptional
regulation. I will test the second hypothesis by conducting a reduced complexity MPRA of identified enhancers
in CACNA1C in vivo during mouse cortical synaptogenesis, including sequences containing the risk allele, the
reference allele, and a deletion centered at the risk-associated SNP. I will also test for cell-type or regional
specificity of expression of CACNA1C enhancers. By testing fewer sequences in my second aim, my sensitivity
to detect allelic differences in activity will be strongly improved and I anticipate being able to determine any
potential differences in activity related to risk-associated sequence variation. The results of these experiments
will clarify the link between risk-related noncoding genomic variation and mechanisms of disease etiology in
mammalian cortical synaptogenesis. Future directions from this research include determining how expression
changes associated with risk variants impact synaptic biology and the study of transdiagnostic genomic or
molecular targets identified in this research for future therapeutic development."
10811667,"Project Summary/Abstract
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating disease with increased incidence in the world. Proposed therapeutic
therapies for this disease have focused on preservation of beta cells and immunomodulation. The mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1), a nutrient sensor, regulates beta cell mass and proliferation by acting on S6K and 4E-
BPs, two major downstream targets of mTORC1. 4E-BPs are hyperphosphorylated by mTORC1 causing their
release from eIF4E and promotion of translation initiation. Activation of 4E-BP2/eIF4E pathway by 4E-BP2
deletion induces beta cell expansion and proliferation by upregulation of IRS2 levels. In addition to beta cells,
mTORC1/4E-BP axis is also crucial for the regulation of adaptive immunity. Preliminary studies suggest that 4E-
BP2 deletion has prosurvival effects for the beta cell in vitro against the cytotoxic effects of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, a cause of beta cell demise in T1D. Using a newly generated global 4E-BP2 deficient mice in the NOD
background (4E-BP2KONOD), preliminary studies showed that 90% of male (not female) mice were protected from
the development of T1D by preserving beta cell mass. In addition, adoptive transfer studies into NOD.scid mice
showed that mice that received splenocytes from 4E-BP2KONOD mice developed significantly less diabetes than
controls that received splenocytes from WT mice. This suggests that inhibition of 4E-BP2/eIF4E interaction could
be a promising therapeutic strategy for T1D by potentially preserving functional beta cells, reduction in
autoimmune injury and enhancing beta cell regeneration. However, how 4E-BP2 deletion protects beta cells
from autoimmune injury and induces immunomodulatory effects and the potential sexual dimorphism of this
phenotype is unknown. Our hypothesis is that 4E-BP2 deletion reverses T1D by two distinct mechanisms: 1. .
Augmenting survival and conserving beta cell function in a T1D inflammatory environment, and 2. modulating
the ability of lymphocytes to mount an immune response. The following aims will test this hypothesis: Aim 1. To
determine the contribution and molecular mechanisms mediated by 4E-BP2 deletion on beta cell survival and
function in the context of T1D and Aim 2. To uncover how 4E-BP2 deletion induces immunomodulatory effects
to protect from T1D. In addition, studies assessing the contribution of beta cells or immune system in the gender
dimorphic phenotype of diabetes protection will complement these aims. The proposed studies will fill an
important knowledge gap by providing insights into the 4E-BP2/eIF4E activation as a pharmacological target for
T1D treatment. Such results will have a positive impact because this target will serve as a platform for designing
novel therapeutic strategies to expand drug development for diabetes."
10811668,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hispanic communities are targeted by tobacco marketing. The continued growth of social media platforms
(e.g., YouTube, TikTok) provides a novel and inexpensive forum through which the tobacco industry can
market its products, including electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Hispanic young adults of college
age use social media at higher rates than adults from other age and ethnic groups, and are attending college in
unprecedented numbers. Recent data indicate that college attendance does not offer the protective effect
against ENDS use that is observed with cigarettes, as college students, including Hispanics, have the highest
prevalence of ENDS use of all age groups and are more likely than their non-college peers to use ENDS. Yet,
little is known about the role of ENDS-related social media on Hispanic college students’ ENDS use and the
underlying mechanisms or mediators that explain the social media effects. In addition, a major limitation of
prior research is the examination of Hispanics as a single group, rather than as distinct groups that vary on
tobacco use by country-of-origin and level of acculturation. We propose to examine the associations between
ENDS-related social media exposure and engagement on subsequent ENDS use among the largest subgroup
of Hispanics, Mexican Americans, and we consider the role of acculturation as a moderator in the
aforementioned associations. The overall goals of the proposed project are a) to identify mechanisms
underlying ENDS-related social media exposure and engagement, and ENDS use among Mexican American
college students and b) to examine the role of acculturation as a moderator of these mechanisms. The Specific
Aims are to 1) characterize ENDS-related social media and ENDS use from the perspective of Mexican
American college students, 2) identify the intrapersonal mediators in the associations between ENDS-related
social media at baseline and subsequent ENDS use two years later among Mexican American college
students, and 3) determine the moderating role of acculturation on the direct and mediated paths between
ENDS-related social media at baseline and subsequent ENDS use two years later . To examine Aim 1, we will
conduct an ecological momentary assessment study and qualitative one-on-one interviews with 51 college
students recruited from one of three colleges in Texas with the largest proportions of Hispanic students . To
examine Aims 2 and 3, we will conduct a three-wave yearly survey with 1,500 college students recruited from
these three colleges . A key innovation of this project is the collection of both subjective and objective data to
quantify and describe social-media exposure and engagement, which will allow us to characterize content that
appeals to and entices Mexican American college students to use ENDS. Results can uniquely inform
culturally relevant interventions and health communication campaigns directed at high-risk Mexican American
college students to decrease ENDS use. Our study team is highly qualified, with diverse complementary
expertise in tobacco use behaviors, related research experience and publications in key areas."
10792576,"Advancing Bio-Realistic Modeling via the Brain Modeling ToolKit and SONATA Data Format
One of the major goals of the BRAIN Initiative is to distill complex, multi-modal data into predictive frameworks
via theory/modeling. As the planning document ""BRAIN 2025: A Scientific Vision"" urges, “theory and modeling
should be woven into successive stages of ongoing experiments, enabling bridges to be built from single cells
to connectivity, population dynamics, and behavior.” However, data-driven, bio-realistic modeling is not widely
practiced, in part because the field needs software supporting such complex modeling and standards for model
sharing and reproducibility.
The Allen Institute has developed two powerful tools addressing these needs. One is the Brain Modeling
ToolKit (BMTK) – a software suite for model building and simulation at multiple levels of resolution, from
networks of biophysically detailed neuronal models, to point-neuron networks, to population-statistics
approaches. The other one is the SONATA (Scalable Open Network Architecture TemplAte) data format,
which provides computationally efficient solutions for storing and exchanging data describing all stages of the
modeling workflow (e.g., structure of model networks, configuration of simulations, simulation outputs). These
tools were developed in coordination with many initiatives, such as NEURON, NEST, Neurodata Without
Borders, NeuroML, PyNN, NetPyNE, and the Human Brain Project. As a result, BMTK and SONATA enable
many applications and have generated substantial interest, with many users already employing these tools.
Most recently, BMTK and SONATA were instrumental in integrating diverse data from the Allen Institute and
from the literature into some of the most sophisticated and bio-realistic models of a brain region to date.
We propose to build a comprehensive user support and dissemination platform for BMTK and SONATA and
help integrate these tools into model building and simulation practices in the community. In addition, the Allen
Institute team joins forces with a University of Illinois team that developed a widely used molecular visualization
software VMD. By integrating this software with SONATA, we will leverage its powerful existing capabilities to
offer a free, highly efficient visualization tool for neuroscience modeling. Together, these tools will facilitate free
exchange and reproducibility of models and support sophisticated modeling work – especially in cases of
large-scale biologically realistic models relying on systematic integration of experimental data – for novice and
expert users alike. These contributions will advance the BRAIN Initiative’s priority areas of Theory and Data
Analysis and Integrated Approaches and will strongly facilitate FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets) in neuroscience modeling."
10792578,"Summary
The study of germ cells has shaped our understanding of many basic fundamental processes across
different species. Germ cells share a number of features that have long fascinated biologists. These cells
undergo meiosis to form haploid gametes, they are exceptionally good at repairing DNA damage, they
utilize a number of small RNA pathways to silence transposable elements, and they reprogram their
epigenome back to a state that supports totipotency. Here, we proposed to use the Drosophila ovary as
a model to continue to gain insights into genome stability, germ cell differentiation, and the cell-specific
regulation of mRNA translation and ribosome biogenesis/turnover. Over the last five years, we have
adopted and optimized a number of innovative CRISPR-Cas9- and recombineering-based methods for
manipulating the Drosophila genome. Using these approaches, we have mutated and/or tagged over 100
genes that exhibit enriched expression in Drosophila gonads. This work provides a solid foundation for
our planned efforts over the next five years. We will focus on a number of different but related areas. We
will continue to characterize the highly conserved Germ Cell Nuclear Acidic Peptidase (GCNA) gene and
its function in protecting the integrity of germ cells across species. We will also continue to characterize
how cytoplasmic Rbfox1 controls early germ cell development. Our previous screening efforts have
identified a small number of mutations that exhibit germ cell tumor formation or germ cell loss
phenotypes. The molecule function of the disrupted genes will be characterized using the tools and
methods we have in hand. Lastly, we are in the process of generating a number of innovative tools that
will allow us to better assess ribosome biogenesis and turnover during germ cell development and early
embryogenesis. We are very excited by this proposed work and believe the successful completion of
these projects will have a positive impact on our understanding of germ cell biology and other molecular
processes that impact human health."
10792580,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
An estimated 15–20 million people in the United States have peripheral artery disease (PAD). Despite
advances in medical therapy, PAD remains associated with considerable cardiac and limb morbidity and
mortality. Currently, more invasive procedures are performed in the lower extremities than in the heart,
demonstrating increasing costs to the system of advanced PAD. Although the pathogenesis of coronary artery
disease (CAD) is well characterized, the pathophysiology of PAD is less understood and the mechanism(s)
that regulate this complex disorder remain uncertain. While antiplatelet therapy (as a class effect) decreases
the incidence and complications from PAD, we noted that the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy differs
between PAD and other vascular phenotypes. In contrast to CAD, aspirin was not particularly effective in PAD
nor was there clinical benefit with more potent P2Y12 inhibition. Clearly, new directions are needed to better
understand the role of platelets in PAD pathogenesis and identify new therapeutic targets. Our group
demonstrated the importance in coding and noncoding RNAs in regulating platelet activity. Leveraging our
established cohort of PAD patients with well-phenotyped platelet activities, we demonstrated the importance of
platelet–leukocyte interactions (in contrast to platelet–platelet aggregation) in the pathogenesis of PAD.
Moreover, we identified an aberrant post-transcriptional regulation of platelets in PAD and demonstrated that
platelets play a central effector role in activating monocytes and fostering inflammation in PAD. Here, we
propose to comprehensively investigate the relationship between (1) platelet activity, (2) the platelet
transcriptome, and (3) effector cell properties in patients with PAD. We will analyze stored platelet samples
from >1,000 patients with longitudinal follow-up, many of whom provided serial collections. Leveraging these
valuable platelet samples, we will focus on identifying novel platelet transcripts associated with vascular
phenotypes and incident cardiovascular events. For example, we will compare patients with (1) PAD vs. other
vascular phenotypes (e.g., CAD, carotid artery stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm), (2) stable PAD vs. CLI,
and (3) incident cardiac (myocardial infarction) vs. limb (major amputation) events. Mechanistic studies using
both cultured megakaryocytes and animal models with platelet-specific knock-in and knock-out of candidate
genes will characterize how these processes are regulated. We are also well positioned to validate our findings
in well-established local, national, and international cohorts. Our data suggest these types of studies can
provide conceptual advances in our understanding of the mechanisms influencing the pathogenesis and
severity of PAD. These insights could be leveraged to design clinical biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to
treat and prevent vascular disease and its life-threatening complications."

African American women (AAW) have higher rates of death and disability from chronic cardiometabolic (CM)
illnesses compared to any other group of women in the US, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
stroke. 80% of AAW are overweight or obese, and they are the largest US sociodemographic group with
inadequate engagement in exercise. Nearly 50% of AAW have cardiovascular disease, and AAW have more
than twice the rate of diabetes compared to White women. Compelling evidence shows that AAW are least
successful at achieving and sustaining CM risk-reduction goals compared to men and women of other
racial/ethnic groups, despite participating in comprehensive lifestyle interventions. These alarming disparities
are due in part to disproportionately high rates of exposure to psychological stress. Culturally-relevant stressors
in AAW are positively and significantly associated with perceived stress, depressive symptoms, unhealthy
eating, and physical inactivity in AAW – CM risk factors. A shortcoming of interventions with AAW is their
inadequate focus on stress exposure, including gender and racialized stress, stress physiology and stress-
related barriers to healthy eating and exercise known to reduce CM risk. To address this shortcoming, we
propose a randomized controlled trial to test a culturally-tailored mindfulness-based stress management
intervention. This RCT is designed to help AAW build on their strengths to promote stress management and
improved CM health by enhancing positive reappraisal, self-regulation, and self-efficacy, all of which are
cognitive-behavioral facilitators of self-management and positively impacted by mindfulness training. In this 2-
arm CM-risk reduction RCT with 200 AAW ≥ 18 years old with CM risk, we will be powered to detect group
differences in exercise and healthy eating behaviors Specific aims are: AIM 1: Test the hypothesis that AAW
participating in an 8-session culturally-relevant mindfulness-based intervention to reduce CM risk have: AIM 1A
(primary) greater sustained improvements in exercise and healthy eating behaviors and AIM 1B (secondary)
greater reduction in CM risk biomarkers (BMI, % body fat, waist to hip ratio [WHR], BP, and inflammatory
cytokines [High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein; hs-CRP])) at 4, 8, and 12 months, compared to AAW in an
attention-control CM risk reduction intervention without mindfulness. AIM 2 (exploratory: Test the hypothesis
that improvements in mindfulness, stress management, positive reappraisal, self-regulation, and self-efficacy
mediate the effects of the intervention on exercise and healthy eating. We will work with a community health
agency and a community advisory board to facilitate the implementation and success of our intervention. We
address the NIH call to identify interventions that promote self-management to reduce disparities through a
culturally-tailored, community-based mindfulness-based intervention for AAW that targets resilience in the face
of culturally-relevant stressors. If effective, we will scale this contextually relevant mindfulness intervention

The Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) utilizes the Cancer Center Support Grant
(CCSG) developmental funds to invest in specific efforts that support the research goals of its overall Strategic
Plan. During the current project period, a total of $903,200 of CCSG developmental funds was distributed for
pilot funding in support of 27 research projects, and to date these investments have already yielded a $16.6M
(18-fold) return on investment. More importantly, the WFBCCC leadership leveraged the CCSG developmental
funds with other Center resources during the project period, and in total it invested $3.4M in pilot awards during
the project period (minus the awards made in late 2020). This investment can be directly linked to the successful
award of $37.9M in extramural, multi-year grant funding – more than an 11-fold yield from the combined
investment. In the next project period, the WFBCCC is requesting developmental funds to support pilot projects,
and up to 20% effort for two early-stage clinical investigators annually who will be charged with developing and
launching an innovative investigator-initiated trial and maximizing WFBCCC’s participation in the National

10813809,"BIOINFORMATICS SHARED RESOURCE (BISR): PROJECT SUMMARY
The rapid generation of highly complex biological and clinical data, along with the evolution of proteomics,
metabolomics, imaging, deep-learning, and single-cell analysis provides unprecedented opportunities for cancer
research. Concomitantly, it also presents major challenges for analyzing, integrating, interpreting, and sharing
these data. In 2017, based on feedback from internal and external advisors and the expanding bioinformatics
needs of the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) members, the former Biostatistics
and Bioinformatics Shared Resource was divided into two independent, but highly collaborative, shared
resources: the Biostatistics Shared Resource (BSSR) and the Bioinformatics Shared Resource (BISR). The
BISR was established by Co-Director Wei Zhang, PhD, who later recruited Umit Topaloglu, PhD, to serve as
Co-Director. The primary goal of BISR is to provide bioinformatics, data, and computational support for state-of-
the-art multi-omics, clinical, and population research efforts at WFBCCC. BISR is responsible for bioinformatics
and high-performance computing support, including study design, data analysis, visualization, and storage, and
preparation of peer-reviewed publications and grant applications. In response to WFBCCC members’ rapidly
growing demand, BISR expanded the genomic data analyses from traditional platforms (e.g., microarray,
sequencing) to the newest state-of-the-art genomics technologies, including 10X single-cell RNAseq, Visium
Spatial gene expression, ATAC-seq, and SPLiT-seq. Working closely with other WFBCCC Shared Resources,
especially the Cancer Genomics and the Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resources, BISR integrates
WFBCCC investigators’ analytic needs for genomics/proteomics/metabolomics for multi-omics projects. BISR
provides data support, management, and sharing for public omics databases such as TCGA, AACR GENIE,
CCLE, as well as data from WFBCCC’s Precision Oncology Initiative. It also uses the institutionally maintained
Translational Data Warehouse and the WFBCCC Cancer Registry. A cost-effective computational solution has
been established with Google Cloud computing, which has clocked more than 3.2 million computing hours. The
services provided by BISR increased by more than 200% since 2017, providing more than 22,900 service-hours
since 2017 to 186 researchers, of whom 137 (>73%) are WFBCCC members. Among the 59 WFBCCC
publications BISR contributed to, 13 have been published to date in high-impact journals (e.g., Lancet Oncol,
JAMA Oncol, Nat Commun, J Exp Med, Cancer Commun, Nucleic Acids Res, and Mol Cancer). BISR provided
support for 16 WFBCCC funded grants since 2017 to date: 1 U54 grant, 3 R01 grants, 1 R21, 2 NCI
Administrative Supplements, 4 DoD grants, 1 SU2C grant, 1 ACS grant, and 3 Foundation grants (1 ACSR grant,
1 V Foundation grant, and 1 NFCR grant). Based on the trending utilization data, BISR anticipates that the
service requests to the BISR will continue to increase by at least 30% every year, and expected to be covered
50/50 by extramural funding and increased WFBCCC intramural support."

The overarching objective of the Cancer Genomics Shared Resource (CGSR)is to maximize the scientific impact
of basic, translational, and clinical cancer research at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center
(WFBCCC). CGSR achieves this objective by providing rapid and cost-effective access to state-of-the-art next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technologies and services, while promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and
education in genomic sciences. CGSR services support a range of research proje cts chiefly directed at the
discovery and characterization of genomic, transcriptomic, and/or epigenetic alterations that: (1) underlie cancer
formation and progression; (2) predict clinical cancer behavior and treatment outcomes; (3) define inter- and
intra-tumoral molecular and clonal heterogeneity; and (4) impact tumor-immune and drug-response interactions.
CGSR prioritizes cancer-related funded research, creates an optimal environment for the rapidly developing
Cancer Center’s Precision Oncology Initiative, as set forth in its Strategic Plan, and partners with other shared
resources to promote integrated cross-shared resource service workflows for advanced genomic applications,
such as single-cell sequencingand spatial single-cell gene expression profiling. CGSR is co-led by Lance Miller,
MS, PhD and GregoryHawkins, PhD, who have established records in cancer genomics research and funding.
CGSR is operated by four full-time technicians with advanced genomics expertise. To expedite data processing
and analysis, a staff bioinformatician is shared between the CGSR and the Bioinformatics Shared Resource.
During the current funding cycle, CGSR has expanded from2.5 to 4.0 full-time technicians, grown its sequencing
services by more than 3-fold, established single-cell sequencing platforms, introduced automation of NGS library
preparation, upgraded NGS sequencing capacity, raised its user base from 39 to 57 WFBCCC members, and
coordinated multiple successful collaborations with other WFBCCC Shared Resources. Du ring the current
funding cycle (11/01/15–10/31/20), CGSR provided genomic services to 92 investigators, 57 (62%) of whom
were WFBCCC members. Notably, 70% of CGSR’s total service capacity (measured by total staff -hours) was
utilized by WFBCCC members. CGSR services directly supported 34 cancer-focused publications and
contributed to the successful award of 22 NCI grants (12 R01s, 5 R21s, 2 R37s, 1 R33, 1 U01, and 1 K22) and

The objective of the Cell Engineering Shared Resource (CESR) is to offer expertise in cell line engineering using
viral and non-viral approaches and to provide the resources to analyze cancer cell growth/death in vitro and in
vivo under a wide variety of experimental conditions. The use of various viral and non-viral vectors, as well as
gene editing techniques (CRISPR/Cas9) have become critical in the experimental toolbox of cancer researchers
to effectively manipulate gene expression and to create desired mutations. CESR has expertise in designing,
implementing, and optimizing new cell culture, cell transduction, and cell line engineering procedures for
investigators and can conduct short-term experiments in a cost-effective manner. CESR provides consultation
without charge for project design. CESR offers ready-to-use stocks of lentiviruses for fluorescent and
luminescent labeling and packages any retrovirus, lentivirus, or adeno-associated virus transfer plasmids into a
replication-deficient viral vector. Additionally, CESR uses Gateway cloning to insert genes of interest into viral
vector transfer plasmids, enabling generation of viral vectors from any cDNA. CESR is a member of Sigma-
Aldrich’s CRISPR Core Partnership Program, which enables CESR users to directly work with scientists at
Sigma-Aldrich to have sgRNAs designed to suit their needs. CESR stocks ready-to-use lentivirus-based Cas9
expression vectors, produces and delivers Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoproteins to cells for gene editing, and
evaluates on-target cutting efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9 through quantification of in/del frequency using targeted
PCR and DNA resolvase-based approaches. CESR establishes cell lines from primary patient samples and
maintains a regional partnership with the Duke University Functional Genomics Facility for high -throughput
screening of small molecules and CRISPR/shRNA libraries. CESR manages advanced instrumentation for

10814186,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and has a high global
health burden. While several AD genetic risk loci have been identified, the causal variant at these genome-
wide association study (GWAS) sites is still unknown despite intensive sequencing efforts. Importantly,
however, most genome-wide sequencing methods fail to accurately resolve tandem repeats, over 40 of
which are key drivers of neurological disorders. We hypothesize that a substantial fraction of genetic
contributions to AD come from variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) that often contain internal repeat
units 20 nucleotides or more and that until now have not been systematically assessed genome-wide. We
have surmounted critical sequencing barriers by establishing state-of-the-art long-read sequencing
techniques to amplify and characterize the exact nucleotide sequence across tandem repeats. We recently
reported the identification of a tandem repeat in WDR7 that is associated with Amyotrophic Lateral
Sclerosis (ALS). Using the pipeline that we established for tandem repeat length estimation and validation,
we propose to characterize human-specific tandem repeat expansions in AD. Our exciting preliminary
analysis reveals many examples of repeats with increased or decreased length in AD. Several of these
significantly differentially expanded repeats are in GWAS loci previously implicated in AD. Remarkably,
the lead SNP at these loci is associated with stepwise changes in repeat length in individuals heterozygous
or homozygous for the risk allele, suggesting that VNTRs may even play a causal role at these loci. We
also identify rare instances of massive expansions, and/or internal sequence differences that depend on
disease state. Our goal is to assess tandem repeats prone to expansion to estimate VNTR length genome-
wide in AD to identify the contribution of novel repeat expansions in disease. We leverage large cohorts of
whole genome sequence data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project. The thousands of
genomes available means we can detect VNTR expansions in Hispanic, African American and Non-
Hispanic White individuals as well as sex-specific effects of VNTR expansions. We will then perform
targeted long-read sequencing of AD DNA samples to resolve the complete sequence of tandem repeats
and define the consequence of internal sequence variation to AD. Finally, we will work to establish
mechanisms of pathogenesis of novel tandem repeat expansions in AD. Our proposed studies will
establish a novel paradigm to interrogate the mechanism of repeat expansion and will reveal insight into
novel genetic factors that cause or modulate risk for AD."

aims: (1) augment external stakeholder awareness of and alliance with TMRC Program expertise and
resources by providing a conduit between the TMRC Program and the broader NTD research community; (2)
enhance the TMRC Program’s collaborative and coordinated scientific impact by providing centralized
administrative, communications, logistical, and operational support; (3) increase the utility of scientific TMRC
resources, including data and specimens collected within the TMRC Program, by increasing data
harmonization and developing and supporting a virtual repository; and (4) support the next generation of
investigators and in-country scientists by implementing and managing the TMRC Program Opportunity Fund.
Successful completion of these aims will include innovative implementation of technological communication
and collaboration tools through a TMRC Program web presence that includes access to critical Program
virtual resources, such as the virtual repository, the Opportunity Fund Gateway, and a Knowledge and
Mentoring Network, to facilitate knowledge transfer and establish mentoring relationships. As the TMRC CC,
we will use our team’s broad experience leading, managing, and providing administrative and data and
specimen sharing support as the CC to numerous complex research consortiums. The team will use existing
relationships with key stakeholders, established procedures and processes that can be easily adapted, and
proven informatics technology to ramp up quickly as the TMRC CC and help advance the work being
completed in support of the TMRC Program objective."
10920474,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This goal of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award is for the candidate
to gain expertise in childhood threat exposure, social motivation (SM), and risk for suicidal thoughts and
behaviors (STBs). Childhood threat exposure increases risk for STBs by affecting brain functioning associated
interpersonal stress. Adolescence is filled with interpersonal stress; yet, not all adolescents with childhood
threat exposure experience STBs, indicating that additional factors exacerbate risk. Identifying additional
factors that interact with threat to increase STBs is imperative for identifying novel suicide prevention target
mechanisms. This project will identify whether SM represents an additional factor that moderates the link
between childhood threat exposure and STBs. Training objectives for this award will include skill acquisition in:
(1) Developmental psychopathology models of childhood threat exposure and SM, (2) Neurobiological and
behavioral mechanisms of risk for STBs, and (3) Advanced intensive time series modeling of brain
connectivity. Training will facilitate the ability to conduct a study characterizing self-report, brain, and behavioral
measures of SM in adolescents (Aim 1) to examine whether maladaptive social motivation strengthens the link
between threat exposure and STBs (Aim 2). A final exploratory Aim 3 will allow for a preliminary investigation
into how puberty, biological sex, and age further moderate the interaction between threat exposure and SM on
STBs. This study will leverage two R01 projects to test Aims in two Cohorts; Cohort 1 (n = 220) includes early
adolescent females aged 9 – 16, while Cohort 2 (n = 275) consists of adolescent male and females aged 15-
18. Experts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Washington University St. Louis, and the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign will mentor and consult with the candidate on the 3 training goals of
this project: Margaret Sheridan Ph.D. & Adam Miller Ph.D. (Co-primary mentors), along with Karen Rudolph
Ph.D., Deanna Barch Ph.D., Katie Gates, Ph.D. (Scientific Advisors), and Eva Telzer, Ph.D. and Joan Luby,
M.D. (Consultants). This award provides the necessary training to become a unique, transdisciplinary
researcher at the intersection of clinical, social, and developmental neuroscience. In consultation with the
mentors, the candidate will use the training and the results of the research to inform the next steps in the
candidate’s program of research on childhood adversity, social motivation, and risk for STBs during
adolescence. Training and results from this award will also inform future R01 submission."

over many decades. Those contributions have been scientific, administrative, and participatory (enrollment on
clinical trials). Contributions have been consistent and numerous over the years. This application summarizes
the intent of its 4 Co-PIs (Levine/Ernstoff/Lele/Singh) and the membership of RPCI to sustain its commitment
to the many strengths inherent to cooperative group research: therapeutic advances; a better understanding of
the biology of cancer; cancer prevention; means to improve the quality of life of cancer patients; piloting of new
drugs and radiologic and radiation and surgical techniques; establishing the relevance of new cellular and
molecular advances to the predictive, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches to patients; and the
advancement of patient advocacy. Investigators at RPCI and its supporting staff fully recognize the essential
importance of the timely and accurate submission of data and specimens to achieve these aims."

 Despite strides in social and political protections for transgender and nonbinary (i.e., transgender) people,
transgender populations continue to face crisis-level rates of mental health concerns. Recent national surveys
show that transgender people face also continue to face a burden of unmet need within healthcare systems,
reporting elevated rates of mental healthcare avoidance of and exclusion from often life-saving services. This
is often a result of discrimination from healthcare providers.
 Many hospital systems are unequipped to support transgender people seeking mental healthcare. As such,
efforts to engage transgender individuals have not made significant dents in improving access to care and
reducing psychological stress. One particular site of risk and opportunity for intervention is the Bronx, NY, a
New York City borough containing the nation’s poorest congressional district and an epicenter of the ongoing
health concerns for TNB people. The current project aims to data from a large group of patients at Montefiore
Medical Center, a hospital system with over 3 million visits per year, to measure and address mental
healthcare disparities. This study targets mental healthcare disparities using patients’ medical charts as well as
interview data with transgender advocates and stakeholders.
 For Aim 1 (Year 1), we will analyze the extent to which transgender people receive fewer and/or worse
quality mental health services at a large hospital site. We will do so by measuring differences between a large
sample of 9,968 transgender adults with an even larger sample of 49,840 non-transgender adults.
 For Aim 2 (Year 2), we will meet with three groups of 36 stakeholders to contextualize why service
disparities exist and strategies to address them. The first group will be composed of transgender people
connected to mental health services. The second will be transgender people who are not connected to mental
health services. The third will be hospital staff and administrators who specialize in transgender-affirming care.
 For Aim 3 (Years 3-4), we will integrate both types of data ( together and create a map to shift the ways
mental health services are provided to improve transgender-affirming care. This award was developed with the
goal of identifying barriers to and enablers of comprehensive TNB care, in order to measure and reduce mental
healthcare disparities for diverse, resilient adult transgender populations."

Emerging viral diseases comprise several of the greatest global risks to human health, and West Africa is a
source and epicenter for several. These include arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), such as chikungunya,
Zika, and yellow fever with African origin and both ancient and recent histories of spread to Asia and the Americas
to initiate massive epidemics. Dengue also increasingly recognized in Africa as a major public health problem.
Zoonotic African hemorrhagic viruses also caused unprecedented outbreaks during the past decade. In 2014,
the first West African epidemic of hemorrhagic fever attributed to Ebola virus spread to several countries
including Sierra Leone, representing by far the most devastating filoviral outbreak on record with over 11,000
fatalities. Lassa virus, causing an estimated 100,000-300,000 hemorrhagic fever cases in Africa annually,
produced an unprecedented 2018-2019 epidemic in Nigeria. The mechanisms whereby these zoonotic viruses
emerge remain obscure along with understanding of their true disease burden and varied clinical disease and
sequelae outcomes. To address these challenges, we will develop a new generation of West African scientists
to predict, prevent and contain emerging viral diseases through multidisciplinary scientific and public health
training. Leveraging our West African Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases (WAC-EID, NIAID U01AI151801),
outstanding research leaders in West Africa, and the exceptional breadth of expertise in emerging viral diseases
at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), we will provide multidisciplinary training for young scientists
from two leading universities: Njala University in Sierra Leone and Jos University in Nigeria. The aims of Training
and Research on Arboviruses and Zoonoses In Nigeria and Sierra Leone (TRAIN) include: 1. Provide general
on-site training at Njala and Jos Universities to Master’s/PhD students enrolled in the local graduate programs;
2. Provide specialized training at UTMB on the most advanced methods and techniques for expertise transfer to
Sierra Leone and Nigeria; 3. Provide on-site research training at Njala and Jos Universities to ensure successful
local implementation of the program, which will include education of laboratory technicians/managers among
others; 4. Integrate trainees into the WAC-EID’s research programs to gain hands-on experience in surveillance
activities, diagnostics and data management. Five trainees per year will participate in short-, medium-, and long-
term training phases at UTMB and in W. Africa. Training activities will include didactic courses, online modules,
field training, molecular/virological techniques including the study of animal models and pathogenesis, biosafety
training, and lab management education. Upon the completion of our training program, these young scientists
will play critical roles in surveillance to better understand the circulation of emerging viruses in the region,
mechanisms of emergence, virus discovery, epidemic transmission, pathogenesis, and countermeasures to
mitigate emerging viral threats. The local training programs are designed to be sustainable, and the 3-way
research and training partnerships will broadly benefit science and public health throughout the region."

 The Southern Consortium Node (SCN) has been an integral part of the NIDA-funded Clinical Trials
Network (CTN) consortium since 2000, evolving to meet changing CTN needs and leading and contributing to a
portfolio of compelling addiction science and treatment research projects with outstanding performance metrics.
We have expanded our network throughout the Southeast and established close and collaborative working
relationships with a diverse and geographically dispersed group of programs including primary care and medical
specialty practices. We have a cost-effective system for accessing specialized expertise for specific CTN trials.
We have solid collaborative relationships with community substance use disorder (SUD) treatment programs,
primary care providers and governmental agencies that facilitate research, implementation and dissemination
efforts. Our CTN efforts are complemented and enhanced by our statewide CTSA infrastructure, creating a
research capacity that extends far beyond our academic home.
 For this renewal, we propose to further expand our network to include six rural states in the Southeast
with a research agenda focused on best practices for bringing evidence-based care to underserved rural
populations across the full continuum of care. We will develop a Health Technology Core to facilitate exploration
of the use of technology to address health disparities in SUD treatment. We will develop an Implementation
Science Core and employ Learning Health System principles to move positive findings into our partnering
practice systems, fulfilling the core CTN mission of moving evidence-based treatment beyond academic settings.
 In sum, the SCN has demonstrated remarkable flexibility, creativity and the collaborative and innovative
spirit required to meet new challenges and take advantage of growing CTN opportunities. We have gathered a
multidisciplinary team with expertise in addiction psychiatry, clinical research, informatics, analytics, healthcare
technology, dissemination and implementation science. We will employ our resources and expertise in
innovative areas to address identified gaps in access, engagement and retention in treatment for individuals with
SUDs. The SCN team looks forward to continued participation in the CTN consortium."
10790013,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intergenerational obesity and diabetes are at epidemic proportions in the US, with exclusive breastfeeding
thought to lessen the risk of obesity and diabetes transmission from mother to child. However, human milk
exhibits high individual variability in non-nutritive bioactive compounds and we are now realizing that this
variation tracks maternal nutritional status. It is critical to provide a more refined evidence base on the
causes and consequences of breast milk variation, especially for infants at high risk of future obesity and
diabetes. In our current grant period we are advancing the field of human milk research to show that milk
hormone and cytokine concentrations, as well as novel milk metabolomic signatures, significantly vary with
maternal body weight and adiposity, and that these milk “bioactives” predict altered early infant growth. The
successful first 5 years of the MILk cohort (Mothers and Infants Linked for Healthy Growth), composed of
360 exclusively breastfeeding, non-diabetic mother-infant dyads, is one of very few studies that are
equipped to both comprehensively characterize milk variation in a large sample of deeply phenotyped
women, and also to examine prospective associations in their children. The primary objectives of the
proposed renewal application are: 1) to expand our understanding of the causes and consequences of
breast milk variation for women and children from birth to age 5 years. The Specific Aims are 1) To identify
human milk bioactives that differ by maternal pregnancy metabolic and weight status; 2) To identify human
milk bioactives that are associated with infant and early childhood growth and metabolic outcomes; and 3)
To test changes during lactation in the metabolomic profile of human milk in women with and without GDM.
These aims will be achieved by leveraging the resources of the existing MILk Study cohort and milk specimens,
and by expanding enrollment to additional women with GDM, with a particular emphasis on enrolling and
retaining women of color. The study uses state-of-the-science infant body composition methods, evaluating
energy expenditure and fuel oxidation in the offspring while employing comprehensive breast-milk sampling
techniques and metabolomic analysis. The proposed research is significant because it tackles an understudied,
but potentially important pathway explaining the vicious cycle of maternal-child obesity/diabetes transmission
prevalent today. The results of the study will help to design interventions to optimize milk composition in, and
provide tailored lactation support for, women with obesity and diabetes. The ultimate goal is to support
breastfeeding women and their infants during the first 1000 days of the child’s life."
10815875,"How oncogenes integrate metabolic pathways to meet the biosynthetic demands of cancer cell growth and
proliferation is a central question of cancer research with broad clinical implications. In high-risk
neuroblastoma, one of the deadliest childhood cancers, the mevalonate pathway is transcriptionally activated.
This metabolic pathway uses acetyl-CoA carbon to produce cholesterol and other metabolites essential to
sustain the proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines in culture and the growth of neuroblastoma tumors in
mouse models. We recently obtained evidence that the oncogenic transcription factor MYCN is required for the
transcriptional activation of mevalonate pathway enzymes and the increased production of cholesterol in cell
lines derived from high-risk neuroblastoma tumors with genomic amplification of MYCN. The proposed
research will address two major questions concerning the molecular basis of MYCN action in reprogramming
of mevalonate metabolism and cholesterol synthesis: 1) how MYCN activates the mevalonate pathway to
increase its output; and 2) how MYCN coordinates other metabolic pathways to increase the supply of acetyl-
CoA. In Aim 1, we will use a combination of cellular and molecular approaches to test the hypothesis that
MYCN disrupts end-product feedback inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by transcriptional activation of
SCAP, a positive regulator of mevalonate metabolism and repression of INSIG2, a negative regulator, leading
to constitutive activation of the mevalonate pathway. We will further investigate the molecular basis for MYCN
repression of INSIG2 expression. In Aim 2, we will use stable isotope tracers in combination with shRNA
silencing and enzyme inhibitors to delineate the metabolic pathways that supply the substrate acetyl-CoA. We
will test the hypothesis that MYCN increases the flux of glutamine carbon into the mevalonate pathway for
cholesterol synthesis via transcriptional activation of nucleotide and serine-glycine synthesis pathways. In Aim
3, we will use stable isotope tracers in combination with enzyme inhibitors to provide in vivo evidence for
glutamine as a major source of carbon for cholesterol synthesis via nucleotide and serine-glycine synthesis
pathways in patient-derived xenografts and the TH-MYCN mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma.
Successful completion of this project will define a molecular mechanism for MYCN to integrate nucleotide,
amino acid, and cholesterol metabolism in driving and sustaining high-risk neuroblastoma, which may suggest
new avenues of therapeutic intervention."
10815879,"Abstract
Toxicant exposures early in life adversely affect health outcomes in both animal models and humans, in part
due to epigenetic mechanisms. Accumulating studies also indicate that exposures' impact on the epigenome
can be tissue and even cell specific. Yet, toxicoepigenetic animal studies are often conducted with single
tissues in bulk and/or limited epigenomic targets (e.g. DNA methylation). Additionally, epigenetic epidemiology
analysis of toxicants is almost always restricted to biologically available, “surrogate” (e.g. blood) samples.
Using a combination of toxicological and epidemiological approaches, the first of two overarching goals of this
Revolutionizing Innovative, Visionary Environmental Health Research (RIVER) application is to advance the
understanding of the effects of representative perinatal exposures (e.g. metals including lead and endocrine
active compounds including phthalates) on the epigenome and longitudinal health risks. To accomplish this, we
will use human physiologically relevant mouse models and longitudinal human birth cohort samples alongside
targeted and unbiased approaches to evaluate DNA methylation, non-coding RNA, chromatin structure, and
gene expression in both sexes in multiple tissues, incorporating single cell approaches when relevant.
Ultimately, we seek to identify tissue-specific epigenomic signatures of exposures contributing to disease
susceptibility as well as regions of the epigenome that may be interrogated with the use of surrogate tissues.
While precision modification of the epigenome holds great promise to modify environmentally induced changes
and reduce disease risk, it is currently out of reach using common available global (e.g. azacytidine) and
targeted (e.g. TALENs, CRISPR) systems. Thus, our second overarching goal is to advance the development
of a suite of tools, based on the PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) system to transform precision environmental
health, while avoiding drawbacks of current technology. In mice, we have shown that piRNA and associated
processing machinery are present and active in somatic tissues, especially the brain, in contrast to prior belief
that the piRNA suppression system was restricted to the germ-line. Evidence from our viable yellow agouti
(Avy) mouse experiments supports piRNA-based DNA methylation induction in vivo. Thus, we propose to use
this class of RNA to develop precision environmental health tools to target specific genes and loci for stable,
mitotically heritable, silencing in somatic cells. First, we will evaluate piRNA/PIWIL machinery across somatic
human tissues to prioritize cell types with high endogenous piRNA machinery for epigenetic editing. Then, we
will develop synthetic piRNAs to target DNA methylation in vitro in exposed rodent and human cell lines. The
research will expand the repertoire of human epigenome editing tools resulting in therapeutics to treat a broad
array of environmental and epigenetic diseases including imprinted gene disorders and cancer. The vision for
the flexible and sustained RIVER support is to innovate the field of environmental epigenomics, develop
translational tools for precision epigenome editing, and be a resource for research and training."

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), caused by the inappropriate activation of the hedgehog
(Hh) pathway, represents a common skin cancer that, while treated surgically, can also exhibit
rapid invasion and metastasis. While Smoothened inhibitors (Smoi) show efficacy, the majority of
advanced BCCs acquire resistance. 5ARO54780 showed that increased expression in BCCs of
the polarity kinase atypical protein kinase C (PRKCi) amplifies Gli activity and confers
resistance, although the mechanism remains unknown. PRKCi cooperates with histone
deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to promote Gli deacetylation and chromatin association. A vicinal
proteomics approach led to the surprising identification that isoforms of the Lamina-Associated
Polypeptide 2 (LAP2) bind to the Gli zinc finger domain. Nuclear envelope tethered LAP2b and
an associated acetyl-lysine reader promote Gli accumulation at a site termed the paused nuclear
complex that protects Gli from degradation or nuclear export. By contrast, nucleoplasmic LAP2a
binds both HDAC1 and Gli allowing it to stably accumulate on chromatin. In turn, PRKCi
prevents LAP2a-HDAC1-GLI degradation while promoting switching from LAP2b to LAP2a. Now
in its 10th year, 5ARO54780 will test the overarching hypothesis that PRKCi-dependent Gli
deacetylation directs association with distinct LAP2 isoforms that amplify pathway activity in
resistant BCCs. We will: 1) Elucidate the structure and function of the Gli-LAP2b paused nuclear
complex as we identify the LAP2b functional domains required for Gli activity, identify
components of the Gli-LAP2b acetyl-lysine reader, and dissect how LAP2 regulates Gli
localization and mobility; 2) Elucidate the structure and function of the GLI-LAP2a activation
complex as we determine whether LAP2a requires Gli for colocalization, define the non-base
contact surface of LAP2-Gli1, and elucidate how PRKCi regulates LAP2a-HDAC1-Gli stability;
3) Establish resistance pathway efficacy and epistasis as we determine the prevalence of the
BCC resistance pathways and determine efficacy of the LAP2-LLD in human and mouse BCC
explants. Completion of the project will deepen our mechanistic insights into transcription factor
trafficking and regulation in the nucleus, help optimize rational BCC therapy, and identify new
therapeutic targets."

This project is a pilot clinical trial of a new brain stimulation treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. OCD
is a mental illness that affects 4-7 million people in the US. Of those, 50-70% still have substantial symptoms
after being treated with medication or talk therapy. Recently, clinicians have started trying to treat OCD with
deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS involves surgically placing electrodes into the brain, then sending electrical
stimulation currents through those electrodes. Most investigators think that DBS for OCD works by affecting
brain circuits called the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops, or CSTC loops. The belief is that OCD is caused
by the CSTC loops being too strongly connected, so that signals get ""stuck"" in them and become the stuck,
perseverative, obsessional thinking of OCD. To interrupt these loops, investigators have placed DBS into the
ventral capsule/ventral striatum (VC/VS), the ""S"" of CSTC.
VC/VS DBS has helped several patient who had very treatment-resistant OCD. However, about half do not get
better. We hypothesize that this is because DBS does not always influence cortico-striatal loops correctly,
because it only affects a single area in this multi-area circuit. Our main objective (Aim 1) is to test a stimulator
that affects the deep brain and the cortex (brain surface) at once and tries to break the abnormal CSTC
synchrony. It drives two brain areas at slightly different frequencies, keeping them ""out of sync"". Our second
objective is to test whether activity in the CSTC loop correlates to the symptoms of OCD. No study has proven
that these two are linked in humans, because it is difficult to record from the human brain, especially over long
periods of time and from deep brain areas. We will use a novel technology, the Medtronic PC+S ""sensing
DBS"", to record the brain's activity while delivering the stimulation treatment (Aim 2a). As patients' symptoms
improve, we expect to see that connectivity and synchrony between the surface and deep brain decreases
along the same trajectory. We will also capture recordings during symptom flares and as patients participate in
symptom-triggering activities such as exposure therapy sessions. This will help us further determine how well
this brain activity correlates to symptoms. Finally, to help capture clearer signals, we will also collect those
recordings while patients do a fear task that is linked to OCD severity, using EEG to further understand the
cortico-striatal response to DBS (Aim 2b). This study leverages a broad interdisciplinary team of psychiatrists,
statisticians, a neurosurgeon, and electrophysiologists, all with experience in OCD and brain stimulation."

The overarching research goal of this K23 Mentored Career Development Award is to improve outcomes
assessment for microbial keratitis (MK), or infectious corneal ulceration. MK affects 2 million people per year
and causes significant harm to vision and quality of life. Meaningful measurement of MK for clinical and
research purposes remains challenging. Traditional clinical assessments of MK severity and response to
treatment are subjective and imprecise, making it difficult to compare efficacy of treatments in clinical research
studies due to low reproducibility and increased sample size requirements. Prior MK clinical trials have used
outcome metrics such as best spectacle-corrected visual acuity which are not disease-specific and may fail to
capture key information about corneal damage caused by MK. These measurement limitations reduce the
quality and impact of MK research. To date, most large-scale prospective randomized trials in MK have failed
to demonstrate clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences in treatment response between
groups. Single-center MK studies can also lack applicability to other healthcare settings due to differences in
patient characteristics and microbial distributions across populations. Developing more objective, reproducible,
clinically relevant, and generalizable outcome metrics and predictors for MK would enhance the clinical
relevance and statistical power of future multicenter MK studies. New imaging modalities such as Scheimpflug
tomography and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT) can provide objective, precise,
reproducible, and clinically relevant assessments of corneal structure, but these modalities have not been
critically evaluated for MK clinical care or research using prospective studies. This application proposes to
conduct a prospective cohort study of MK patients at Johns Hopkins. We will collect detailed clinical and
microbiologic data and perform serial multimodal imaging using slit lamp photography, Scheimpflug
tomography, and ASOCT over 6 months. Aim 1 will compare the reproducibility and concordance of ultrasound
pachymetry, Scheimpflug tomography, and ASOCT for objective quantification of corneal thinning in MK. Aim 2
will evaluate Scheimpflug densitometry as a means of objectively quantifying longitudinal changes in corneal
scar density in MK. Aim 3 will assess whether certain early anatomic or clinical features can improve prediction
of subsequent visual outcomes in MK and whether these predictors are applicable across different MK
populations and infection subgroups, indicating the suitability of these novel outcome metrics for use in
collaborative multicenter clinical trials. This proposal will provide the candidate with the advanced training and
research experience needed to become an expert in clinical trials methodology and an independently funded
clinician-scientist in the field of cornea and external diseases. The candidate proposes a comprehensive
training plan combining rigorous formal coursework, seminars, and workshops in the intellectually rich
environment at Johns Hopkins University; world-class mentorship under Drs. Douglas Jabs, Thomas Lietman,
Elizabeth Sugar, and Albert Jun; immersive experience with ongoing prospective multicenter clinical trials; and
applied research experience. Specific training areas include: (1) advanced clinical trial methodology; (2)
practical clinical trial implementation; (3) advanced biostatistics; (4) clinical and research expertise in microbial
keratitis; and (5) career development as a clinician-scientist. Results from the candidate’s research will be used
to develop a proposal for a R01 or UG1 funded clinical trial that will improve evidence-based treatment for
cornea and external diseases."
10818550,"Early developmental exposure to GABAergic drugs leads to lasting changes in brain reward systems and reward-
related behaviors, possibly due to the protracted development of the brain GABA system which extends several
years into postnatal development, presenting a long developmental vulnerability window. Exposed individuals
are more vulnerable to mood and addiction disorders as adults. Over 1.5 million infants and toddlers go through
procedures that require general anesthetics (GAs) each year. GAs achieve most of their therapeutic end-points
through their interactions with GABAA receptors (GABAARs) and cause persistent changes in the expression and
trafficking of GABAARs similar to those caused by other GABAergic drugs. However, there is a significant gap in
knowledge when it comes to the question of whether limited early developmental exposure to GABAA-acting GAs
may also induce molecular and plastic changes in brain reward systems and reward-related behaviors that last
into adulthood. The overall objective of this application is to address this gap using mice as a model system,
focusing on evolutionarily-conserved brain circuits in well-controlled experiments. Our central hypothesis is
that early exposure to GAs, as a robust and well-controlled model of GABAergic drug exposure, induces per-
manent changes in GABAAR expression and/or trafficking in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), disrupting neuro-
transmission in intra-NAc microcircuits and affecting reward-related behaviors. As such, our specific aims are
to determine early GA exposure induced changes at the molecular level (GABAAR expression and trafficking),
circuit level (intra-NAc neurotransmission and PFC–NAc feedforward inhibition) and behavioral level (respon-
sivity to natural and drug rewards, stress-susceptibility). Considering the diffuse and extensive molecular effects
of early GA exposure across brain circuits, our specific aims also include establishing causality between the dif-
ferent levels of analyses, by attempting to alleviate disruptions in neurotransmission and behavior by normaliz-
ing NAc GABAAR expression and activity. We believe the contribution of these findings to the field will be signif-
icant, as they will extend our fundamental knowledge of long-lasting changes in the GABAAR system induced by
GABAAR manipulations during specific developmental vulnerability periods. Translationally, the findings will
indicate whether early GA-exposed children may be at risk for addiction and mood disorders as adults and will
identify a causal molecular, pharmacologically targetable culprit. The findings will have wide-ranging impli-
cations for short-term postnatal exposure to other GABAergic drugs, such as anxiolytics, sedatives and antiepi-
leptics. Our studies are innovative, we believe, as they represent a significant departure from the status quo in
their focus on this significant, yet neglected question, in their approach that pertains to multiple levels of analyses
and establishes causality between them, and in the use of state-of-the-art techniques, such as single-cell protein
analysis and temporally-precise optogenetic control of receptor activity, which makes it possible to address the
questions at hand with a level of detail and precision that is not possible with more conventional approaches."
10818553,"Osteocalcin is among the most highly expressed proteins in bone. Based on studies performed using the
Ocnm1 strain of osteocalcin knockout (KO) mice, osteocalcin was suggested to be a bone-derived hormone that
regulates glucose metabolism, fat storage, male fertility, muscle mass, brain development, and cognition. These
novel and exciting roles for osteocalcin led to many downstream studies in mice, and in humans, which yielded
inconsistent and even contradictory results. Two independently generated and examined new strains of
osteocalcin KO mice (Bglap/2dko and Ocn-) did not have abnormal glucose metabolism, fat storage, male fertility,
or muscle mass; neurologic phenotypes were not examined in the 2 new KO strains. The inconsistent findings
between the original (Ocnm1) and new (Bglap/2dko and Ocn-) osteocalcin KO strains creates a challenge and an
opportunity. The challenge is to determine which originally reported hormonal phenotypes are robust (i.e., true
positives), and whether these phenotypes may have been missed (i.e., false negatives) in the new KO strains.
Opportunity arises if the previously published data are correct, since this would mean that differences between
the specific KO allele, the genetic background (e.g., 129 vs C57), or the environment (e.g., diet, microbiome) in
which animals were raised (or studied) are responsible for whether and how osteocalcin deficiency affects
metabolism, fertility, ageing, and cognition. We will determine which findings in the original Ocnm1 KO strain and
in the Bglap/2dko KO strain are robust, and whether there are any consistent phenotypes (e.g., behavioral, bone
apatite crystal orientation) across strains. These are possible now that both strains are available from The
Jackson Laboratory (JAX). JAX will expand each strain in its maxi-safe vivarium to minimize environmental
confounders. JAX will genotype and ship animals from each strain to laboratories expert in studying metabolic,
reproductive, muscle, neurologic, and skeletal phenotypes; these expert labs will perform phenotyping blinded
to animal strain (Ocnm1 or Bglap/2dko) and genotype (WT or KO). Phenotype data will be sent to the study
statistician, PI, and Data Review Panel for review. The Data Review Panel has 4 expert skeletal biologists, all
past-Presidents of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Manuscripts deriving from this work
will be posted on BioRxiv and submitted to open-access, peer-reviewed, journals. Performing well-powered,
blinded studies using publicly available mice raised in a common environment, studied by expert laboratories,
and reviewed by respected leaders in the field of skeletal biology is essential for resolving conflicts regarding the
endogenous role of osteocalcin and for identifying factors (e.g., KO allele, genetic background, environment)
that may modify the effect of osteocalcin deficiency between mouse strains and between human populations."
10819152,"Chronic pain mismanagement has led to opioid overuse, overdose related deaths and cardiovascular, renal
and neurological complications at epidemic proportions. To combat these problems, it is essential to elucidate
critical gaps in knowledge pertaining to the underlying mechanisms controlling the processes of initiation and
maintenance of chronic pain conditions. The current paradigm implies that tissue or nerve damage triggers
protective immune response that should be resolved as soon as its function is fulfilled. If inflammation is not
resolved, then transition from the acute to chronic pain could occur. We propose that critical regulators of a
delicate balance between protective immunity and immunopathology could be good candidates for controlling
a sustained inflammatory response after tissue or nerve damage; and subsequently, regulating the process of
development of chronic pain. One of such critical regulators is lymphotoxin-beta receptor (LTβR), a
member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate whether
and how peripheral LTβR signaling regulates the process of the initiation and maintenance of pain in
inflammatory and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) models. Based on the existing
literature and our preliminary data, we propose an entirely novel regulatory mechanism for the initiation and
maintenance of inflammatory as well as CIPN pain wherein peripheral LTβR signaling controls these
processes by regulating the network of transcriptional and cellular plasticity in hindpaw and DRG cells.
Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that peripheral LTβR signaling controls the processes of initiation
and maintenance of inflammatory and CIPN pain via governing the network of transcriptional and
cellular plasticity mediating communication between peripheral cells and sensory neurons. Our
hypothesis will be tested by three interconnected yet independent aims. Aim 1 defines the impact of
peripheral LTβR signaling on the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory and CIPN pain in male and
female mice. Aim 2 determines the cellular basis of LTβR signaling at the periphery during inflammatory and
CIPN pain. Aim 3 examines the impact of peripheral LTβR signaling on inflammation- and CIPN-induced
sensory neuronal and non-neuronal transcriptional and cell plasticity in paw and DRG. The proposed study is
innovative because it describes conceptually novel peripheral regulatory mechanism controlling the
processes of initiation and maintenance of chronic pain, which are regulated by LTβR. The proposed
research is significant as it (1) advances our understanding of mechanisms regulating the transition from
acute to chronic pain; and (2) offers LTβR signaling antagonists as potential therapeutic targets for prevention
and full and sustained reversal of CIPN chronic pain, as well as effective and long-lasting management of
inflammatory pain."
10819174,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are extending the survival of patients with advanced, metastatic cancer,
across many cancer types. Remarkably, immunotherapies may be curative, yet, only a fraction of cancer pa-
tients have strong durable responses to ICIs. Response rates also differ greatly between cancer types, and
some ICIs are only effective against a handful of cancers. The reasons for this remain unclear, underscoring
the need for further research.
Many ICIs, like antibodies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, act on tumor-specific T cells that are already
fighting the cancer at the time the patient is diagnosed with disease. The therapies reinvigorate T cells and
cause them to attack and sometimes destroy the cancer. Little is known about the T cells that mediate thera-
peutic responses or the factors that modulate their therapeutic efficacy. Thus, there is great interest in deter-
mining how these therapies work and in augmenting them so that response rates increase. Unfortunately, it
has not been easy, because few animal models recapitulate the natural biology of human cancer and elicit de-
tectable anti-tumor immune responses. Genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models are widely used for stud-
ies in cancer biology because they allow investigators to study developing tumors and to understand how tu-
mors change over the course of disease. Yet, these gold-standard models are not used for cancer immunology
studies because tumors do not express neoantigens, which are required for anti-tumor T cell responses.
It has been challenging to develop GEM models where tumors express neoantigens. To remedy this problem,
we engineered the “NINJA” mouse, and, in this proposal, we will use NINJA to generate “immunogenic” GEM
models for cancer (i.e., models that elicit anti-cancer immune responses). We will standardize immunogenic
models for lung and pancreatic cancer, investigate how neoantigens alter the immune cell infiltrates into tu-
mors, and confirm their translational potential as faithful mimics of human cancer. Moreover, we will develop
cell line and organoid models from these immunogenic GEMs, which will greatly increase the available tools for
researchers in lung and pancreatic cancer.
These state-of-the-art models will allow scientists to look at lung and pancreatic tumors at early stages (before
cancers would be diagnosed in a patient), and to figure out how these early tumors and immune cells interact.
Moreover, our studies will validate NINJA as a platform that can be used by other investigators for the genera-
tion of immunogenic GEMs for other cancer types. As these models can be used to improve responses of pa-
tients to immunotherapy, NINJA will be useful for enhancing the applicability of almost any GEM model for
translational research."

specifically from enucleation to reticulocyte maturation into red blood cells. Several outstanding questions in
this field include what factors regulate the exit of last mitosis of erythroblast for enucleation, how nascent
reticulocyte separate from the extruded nucleus, and what signals are involved in regulating the clearance of
organelles in reticulocytes. Answers to these questions with mechanistic insights are important not only for our
understanding of the basic biology of terminal erythropoiesis and pathophysiology of many red cell-related
diseases, but also to provide clues for efficient strategies of in vitro or ex vivo generation of red blood cells in
transfusion medicine. In this respect, we have been working on the role of mDia formins in terminal
erythropoiesis and our recent novel unpublished findings may help shed light on the clues to these questions.
Using a mDia2 hematopoietic-specific knockout mouse model, we revealed that mDia2 controls the motility of
the nascent reticulocyte that is required for the detachment of the pyknotic nucleus. Reticulocytes in mDia2
deficient mice are rigid with extended spectrin chains, primarily due to the disrupted actin profilaments. mDia2
deficient reticulocytes also show defects in membrane remodeling and organelle clearance. We further
revealed in our preliminary data that Chmp5, one of the major components of the ESCRT III complex, is a
novel downstream mediator of mDia2. Our preliminary mechanistic studies indicated that mDia2 regulates the
transcriptional activity of serum response factor (SRF) and Chmp5 is a potential novel target of SRF. These
results led us to hypothesize that mDia2 regulates the ESCRT III complex to control membrane remodeling
and organelle clearance during reticulocyte formation. In this project, we will use in vivo mouse models,
transplantation assays, various biochemical assays, and cutting-edge microscopy to study 1) the functional
roles of mDia2 in the formation and organelle clearance of reticulocytes. 2) the mechanism of mDia2-SRF-
Chmp5 signaling in the regulation of reticulocyte membrane remodeling and organelle clearance, and 3) the
post-translational modifications of mDia2 in its roles in reticulocyte maturation. Successful completion of our
proposed studies has the potential to open a new field in signaling transduction that modulates enucleation to
reticulocyte formation. Understanding the emerging roles of mDia2 as a master regulator of the late stage
terminal erythropoiesis will have an important impact in this field as a paradigm."

Natural vision relies on segmenting spatially distributed stimuli within the visual environment and encoding them
according to spatial context. For neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), their response depends on the
variance of visual stimuli between the classical receptive field and the surround. This property known as
“surround modulation” powerfully influences sensory coding but its magnitude and sign flexibly depends on the
degree of similarity of features, such as orientation, between the center and surround. The specific V1 circuits
that explain orientation dependence of surround modulation are largely unknown. This project aims to elucidate
the synaptic and circuit mechanisms of orientation dependence of surround suppression through an all-in-vivo
approach combining two-photon (2P) targeted whole-cell electrophysiology, single-cell resolution 2P holographic
optogenetics to map synaptic connectivity, and 2P calcium imaging to record population activity. The hypothesis
of this project is that the orientation dependence of surround suppression depends on orientation-tuned
somatostatin (SST) interneuron-mediated lateral inhibition via co-tuned excitation from the surround. As SST
interneurons respond strongly to large iso-oriented but not cross-oriented visual stimulation where the center
and surround are orthogonally oriented, this suggests that the tuning of SST interneurons to spatial context is
key to feature dependence of surround suppression. To test the core hypothesis of tuning-specific connectivity
driving feature-preference across retinotopic space, the aims in this project will first examine the synaptic drive
in SST interneurons that gives rise to their selectivity for relative orientation of the center and surround, and next
use a novel combinatory in vivo 2p calcium imaging/2p holographic optogenetic approach to test whether
orientation-specific connectivity supports the physiological tuning of V1 SST neurons and pyramidal cells to
contextual stimuli. These experiments will not only provide a mechanistic understanding of aspects of visual
computation, but also demonstrate conceptual and technical advances that may be applied broadly to other key
questions in neuroscience."

Cortical visual impairment (CVI) is the leading cause of pediatric visual impairment in developed countries. There
is no evidence-based treatment, and design of clinical trials is hampered by the absence of a validated method
of visual assessment that captures the numerous aspects of visual function that are compromised in pediatric
CVI. Our laboratory is investigating the use of eye tracking in children with CVI. During eye tracking, an infrared
camera tracks the pupillary and corneal light reflections while a child watches visual stimuli on a computer
monitor. The eye tracker calculates the direction of eye gaze with high spatial and temporal frequency. Our eye
tracking protocol assesses multiple afferent, efferent, and higher-order visual parameters during a 12-minute
recording session. Our initial data show that eye tracking is reliable and quantifies multiple visual and oculomotor
parameters in children with CVI. Given the large amount of data generated by eye tracking (2,000 data points
per second), higher-level analytics are required. We will validate a machine-learning model of eye tracking in
children with CVI via three Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will quantify deficits of visual function in pediatric CVI
using eye tracking, strengthening the findings in our preliminary data by inclusion of a well-powered sample. In
Aim 2, we will use machine learning to develop a CVI eye tracking severity score. In Aim 3, we will validate eye
tracking by comparing and contrasting with two other methods of visual assessment in children with CVI, sweep
visual evoked potentials and the CVI Range. Together, these studies will establish eye tracking as a quantitative,
objective, and comprehensive measure of visual function in pediatric CVI. In the R01 application planned at the
end of the K23 award period, we will incorporate the CVI eye tracking severity score as an outcome measure in
a longitudinal study of standard and targeted therapies for CVI. In pursuit of these aims, I will be mentored by a
highly experienced, interdisciplinary, internationally recognized team at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles and
University of Southern California. Under their guidance, I will also pursue a Masters degree in Applied Data
Science and gain experiential learning in electrophysiology. The training acquired during my Career
Development Award will enable me to transition to an independent investigator leading a research program
focused on developing next-generation technologies to interrogate the visual system in children with a variety of
neurodevelopmental disorders."

In this K01 proposal, Dr. Arin Oestreich, PhD, presents a detailed career development plan that will culminate in
an independent academic faculty position. Dr. Oestreich will obtain critical skills in (1) animal models of
osteoarthritis (OA), (2) chromatin profiling and transcriptomic analysis using single nucleus sequencing, and (3)
bioinformatic approaches to integrate multiomic platforms and decipher signaling pathways programed by
maternal obesity. Dr. Oestreich uniquely combines her background in maternal obesity with new training in OA
to enhance her scientific career. Equipped with this unique dual expertise and preliminary data, Dr. Oestreich
will be well positioned to develop an independent research program focused on studying the effects of specific
components of the maternal obese milieu on offspring joint health.
The scientific goal of this project is to determine the impact of maternal n-6 HFD on the epigenetic regulatory
mechanisms governing offspring OA risk and to isolate the effect of maternal dietary n-6 fatty acids on
programming offspring OA. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that maternal n-6 enriched HFD increases the severity
of injury-induced OA in the adult offspring and determine the critical window of developmental exposure. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that maternal n-6 HFD directly programs the knee joint by stably altering the epigenetic
landscape of the musculoskeletal progenitors during development. This aim will use multiomic single nucleus
sequencing of the epigenome and transcriptome to pursue genetic targets are epigenetically regulated by
maternal obesity and known to heighten OA severity in the adult knee. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
controlling the n-6:n-3 fatty acid ratio in obese dams will decrease maternal-fetal inflammation and protect the
adult offspring from developing OA. By determining the impact of specific maternal dietary fatty acids on fetal
limb development, the data collected in this proposal will be invaluable for formulating prenatal vitamins with
optimal ratios of n-3 PUFAs as a novel strategy to protect the adult offspring joint health.
With the support of this K01 and the training provided in her career development plan, Dr. Oestreich will be
uniquely poised to attain her primary goal of becoming an independent researcher in the field of developmental
programming of musculoskeletal disease."
10914827,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - MECHANOSURVEILLANCE IN BREAST CANCER METASTASIS
Metastatic breast cancer is a devastating disease that impacts the lives of tens of thousands of women each
year. Unfortunately, the majority of treatment options for patients diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer are
palliative. Current treatment strategies often target cancer cells’ genetic and biochemical abnormalities, but
cancer cells also undergo profound changes in their biophysical properties such as cellular stiffness. Targeting
biophysical properties offers exciting new therapeutic avenues, but the basic knowledge on the relationship
between cancer cell stiffness and regulation of metastasis is incomplete. Emerging evidence suggests that
cancer cell stiffness acts as a mechanical input for activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes that destroy cancer
cells. Thereby, stiffness becomes an immune vulnerability of cancer cells during the metastatic cascade. This
process, where mechanical inputs activate the immune surveillance, is termed mechanosurveillance and it is
strongly regulated by the expression of Myocardin related transcription factors A and B (MRTFA/B) in cancer
cells. Based on the published and the preliminary data, the overarching hypothesis of this project is that
MRTFA driven calcium influx increases cancer cell stiffness and thereby activates mechanosurveillance during
breast cancer metastasis. The long-term goal of this project is to determine the molecular mediators of MRTFA
associated mechanosurveillance and thereby inform pharmacological methods to exploit this cancer cell
vulnerability for better treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The research design includes a set
of interdisciplinary approaches, such as transcriptomic and genomic analyses of patient samples and cancer
models, atomic force microscopy on patient derived xenograft organoids (PDXos) and on immunocompetent
models of metastatic colonization, and histological analyses of human breast cancer metastases. The specific
aims of this project are:
1) to determine the contribution of MRTFA driven calcium influx on cancer cell stiffness in PDXos, in
 vitro, and in situ mouse models by using atomic force microscopy and confocal microscopy.
2) to determine the degree of cytotoxic lymphocyte activation by MRTFA and the associated stiffness
 in vivo by using multiplexed imaging and machine learning on metastatic tissue samples from patients and
 by using flow cytometry in metastases in syngeneic mouse models.
3) to determine how to exploit MRTFA associated mechanosurveillance to target metastases by testing
 the impact of clinically relevant immune checkpoint blockade treatments on metastasis bearing mice.
This work will uncover mediators of mechanosurveillance and demonstrate its prevalence in human cancer.
Thus, results of this work will impact the immediate use of immune checkpoint blockade and the future
strategies to enhance mechanosurveillance in patients with metastatic breast cancer."

 Therapeutic trials in rare diseases are challenging, particularly those that involve children and therapeutic
choices with potentially life or death consequences. Patient-specific tissue-chip approaches have the potential
to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy without exposing patients to risks associated with experimental therapy or
randomization to the control arm. Moreover, patient-specific tissue-chip approaches may de-risk clinical trials
by optimizing patient selection and inform future clinical trials by elucidating mechanisms that underlie the vari-
ation in patients' therapeutic responses. Achieving these long range goals requires demonstration that patient-
specific tissue-chip platforms accurately predict the therapeutic responses of individual patients. Here we pro-
pose to test the hypothesis that tissue-chips predict therapeutic responses in catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a rare inherited arrhythmia and to gather information critical for the design of
future therapeutic trials.
 CPVT is among the most malignant and difficult to treat of the inherited cardiac arrhythmias. A hallmark of
CPVT is ventricular arrhythmia induced by exercise and emotional stress. Despite standard-of-care therapy, in-
cluding β-blockers, implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs), or surgical sympathetic cardiac denervation, the
estimated 8 year fatal or near-fatal event rate is ~15%, with death occurring in ~6%. Over the past decade, fle-
cainide has proven to be effective therapy for many CPVT patients, either in combination with β-blocker or as
monotherapy. However, some patients do not respond to flecainide. Mechanisms of non-responsiveness and
predictors of response have not been identified. We have recently reported that CaMKII inhibition is a promis-
ing therapeutic strategy for CPVT, and future therapeutic trials of CaMKII inhibition will likely be performed in
CPVT.
 In the UG3 phase of this proposal, we will recruit patients whose clinical response to flecainide is known,
and generate iPSCs from these patients. At the same time, we will optimize tissue chip platforms to assess ar-
rhythmia risk using patient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). In the UH3 phase, we will per-
form two ""clinical trials"" in a dish: First, in a ""retrospective clinical trial"" in a dish, we will compare patients'
known flecainide responses to the responses of their iPSC-CMs. Second, we will assess the spectrum of
genotypes where CPVT inhibition is effective, and determine if there are favorable or unfavorable interactions
between CaMKII inhibition and flecainide.
 Together these studies will rigorously test the hypothesis that personalized disease models can predict indi-
vidual patient therapeutic responses and can be used to help plan future clinical trials."

 Age-related cognitive decline is an important concern in the United States, as approximately 20% of the
US population is expected to be age 65 or older by year 2030. Understanding the molecular mechansims of
brain aging to prolong healthy cognitive function is therefore increasingly important as the population ages and
older people remain in the work force. Brain cells exhibit profound and heterogeneous changes during aging at
molecular and cellular levels. The simple intervention of physical exercise has emerged as a major positive
modulator of cognitive function in aging. In response to RFA-RM-20-005, we have formed an interdisciplinary
team with expertise in single-cell genomics, neural circuitry, and aging, to investigate age- and physical activity-
related changes of 4D nucleome in post-mortem human brain hippocampus cells across the lifespan with single-
cell resolution. We hypothesize that cell-type-specific re-organization of nucleome occurs in the human
hippocampal brain region during aging and with physical activity. The changes in nucleome in turn control brain
epigenome and transcriptome, modulating neural circuit functionality. The “Methyl-HiC”, a new approach for
joint profiling of DNA methylation and chromatin contacts in single cells, combined with “Paired-seq”, an ultra-
high-throughput method for single-cell joint analysis of open chromatin and transcriptome, will be used to
interrogate the chromatin architecture along with DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and gene expression
in the human hippocampus. In Aim 1, we will determine changes in nucleome in major cell types of post-mortem
human hippocampus across the life-span with 4 age ranges (20–39, 40–59, 60–79, and 80–99 years old). We
will further correlate these changes in nucleome with epigenome and transcriptome in each cell type, to identify
vulnerable cell types during aging, and uncover potential gene regulatory programs that could be impacted by
aging. In Aim 2, we will determine how physical activity modifies and restores nucleome in specific human
hippocampal cell types. We will study two age-matched cognitively–healthy cohorts (70-99 years old) with either
high level or low level physical activity, as measured by wearable activity monitors. We will correlate restorative
effects on nucleome with epigenome and transcriptome. In Aim 3, we will map how aging and exercise alter
nucleome in specific hippocampal cell types with highly controlled quantifiable physical activity in the mouse
model, for comparison with human data. These mouse studies allow the exercise variable to be investigated in
isolation from effects of other lifestyle factors that can affect hippocampal nucleome, which is not possible with
human subjects. The proposed research will help to transform our ability to understand the mechanisms of
chromatin organization and function in the context of human brain aging."

Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common, costly, and cause significant impairment that can
begin in infancy. FGIDs remain poorly understood, and treatment are often ineffective, prompting a recent
NIDDK workshop to conclude an urgent need for improved understanding and management paradigms. In this
proposal, we test the hypothesis that serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant exposure in pregnancy
is a major contributor to FGIDs in children. This is based on the premise that SSRIs, when used by women in
pregnancy, alter the fetal availability of serotonin (5-HT), which is critical for healthy nervous system
development in both the brain and the gut. There are significant public health implications, as SSRI use in
pregnancy is continually increasing and it is estimated that upwards of 350,000 newborns per year were
exposed to an SSRI during gestation. Most of the studies to date on the long-term effects of SSRI exposures
have focused on offspring brain development. In contrast, studies on the effects of maternal SSRI exposure on
gut development are lacking. However, our group has compelling evidence, through both published studies
and new preliminary data, suggesting associations between SSRI exposure and FGID risk, which are
independent of exposure to maternal depression. We have also identified a specific microbiome profile
(enterotype) that is highly linked to FGIDs, and which our preliminary results suggest, may be transferred from
mother to infant where it continues to drive elevated 5-HT signaling. Thus, SSRI exposure could increase
offspring FGID risk, and this risk could be mediated by microbiome changes in the mother and child. We will
investigate these questions by building on an ongoing birth cohort study of 375 mother-infant dyads (“The
MYRNA Study”; controls, maternal depression +/- SSRI exposure) being followed through pregnancy and the
first two years of life. Our new study, which we term, “Gestational SSRI Exposures in the DevelopmenT of
Functional GAStrointestinal Disorders (GETGAS)”, will leverage MYRNA infrastructure and population, while
adding extensive characterization of FGID diagnoses and symptoms, and analyzing stool samples (mother in
pregnancy, and infant at birth, 1 yr and 2 yr) to test the role of microbiota-driven 5-HT signaling pathways. We
will do this through three specific aims: Aim 1: Confirm effects of gestational SSRI exposure on infant FGID
development trajectories in the first two years. Aim 2: Test whether maternal SSRI use during pregnancy
promotes a 5-HT producing microbiome that is vertically transferred to the offspring where it increases FGID
risk. Aim 3: Use data driven methods to identify clusters of maternal and infant factors most predictive of
FGIDs in early life. Findings from this innovative and cost-effective proposal will help disambiguate the effects
of PMD, SSRI exposure, and transmission of maternal microbiota on the development of FGIDs in early life,
inform clinical management of FGIDs, and provide a foundation for biomarker and therapeutic target discovery."
10818189,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a highly contagious global pathogen that infects millions of individuals
annually. Almost 38 million individuals worldwide are living with HIV, and approximately 62% with HIV are
receiving antiretroviral therapy. Rapid, sensitive, and accurate detection of HIV infection is critical for
controlling transmission and accurately prescribe antiviral treatment to patients. Laboratory-based detection of
HIV genomes, antigens and specific antibodies in patient samples is commonly used detect acute HIV
infection, but tends to be slow and require in-clinic sample collection. Rapid point-of-care diagnostic HIV
assays are commercially available for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) patients but are relatively insensitive
and cannot detect early phase infections or directly detect viral particles to indicate an acute infection,
increasing the chance of unknowingly transmitting HIV to their partners. Therefore, development of new types
of low-cost at-home HIV diagnostics are urgently needed to improve HIV detection and help clinicians, public
health departments, and individuals limit the spread of HIV.
The goal of this application is to continue development of a novel electrochemical diagnostic system we call
the HIV electrochemical Capillary-Driven Immunoassay (HIV-eCaDI) to selectively detect HIV-1 p24
antigen present in patient blood samples at limits of detection of 10 pg/ml in a simple, rapid, and inexpensive
format that can be easily perform at home by individuals undergoing PrEP. HIV-eCaDI is a fundamentally
different point-of-care system that integrates inexpensive automated unpowered microfluidic sample
preparation with a highly sensitive and accurate electrochemical detection modality to provide robust
diagnostics results that can rapidly provide critical data to physicians and public health departments. The heart
of this system is our eCaDI system, a disposable hybrid paper/plastic-based electrochemical sensor unit we
have developed that is designed to automate sample preparation and analyte detection in patient blood
samples. The disposable eCaDI cartridge is integrated with an inexpensive custom onboard near field
communication potentiostat that is powered and controlled by the user’s mobile phone, providing simple,
robust, and user-friendly HIV monitoring and patient data management. The proposed HIV-eCaDI system
leverages a number of different Colorado State University strengths (infectious diseases, electrochemistry,
microfluidics platform development) with deidentified clinical samples from Columbia University Medical Center
towards development and validation of a single fully integrated and highly adaptable system to rapidly detect
HIV infection early that will save lives and help HIV positive individuals maintain quality of life."

Taxi ROADmAP (Realizing Optimization Around Diet And Physical activity) is an effectiveness-
implementation hybrid type 1 design using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to
address the overweight and obesity crisis in a growing, at-risk, multilingual low socioeconomic
status (SES), hard-to-reach, predominantly immigrant and minority essential worker population:
taxi and for-hire vehicle (FHV) drivers (Lyft, Uber, etc.). MOST, an innovative framework, involves
highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the effects of individual treatment
components to guide assembly of an optimized treatment package that achieves target outcomes
with the lowest resource consumption and participant burden. Hybrid trials, which blend
effectiveness and implementation studies, can lead to more rapid translational uptake and more
effective implementation. There are over 750,000 licensed taxi and FHV drivers in in the U.S. and
over 185,000 in New York City (NYC). They have higher rates of overweight/obese range body
mass index (BMI) than New Yorkers in general (77% vs 56%) and have high rates of elevated
waist circumference, sedentary behavior, poor diets, and health care services underutilization.
Obesity, a shared cardiovascular disease and cancer risk, and its consequences affect minority
and low SES populations disproportionately. Modifiable factors, such as physical inactivity,
compound drivers’ obesity risk. While there is much evidence on effective multicomponent lifestyle
interventions focused on weight loss in non-minority populations, such as the Diabetes Prevention
Program (DPP) and Look AHEAD, these programs were not designed to be translatable to
community settings and are considered too expensive and burdensome to be widely disseminated.
There is a paucity of data on how to optimize such approaches for minorities (who have benefitted
less from weight loss programs than non-Hispanic whites), to reduce participant burden and costs
but still lead to meaningful weight loss. Even less literature addresses implementation potential
and strategies for such interventions. ROADmAP builds on our unique preliminary work and
uses a hybrid type 1 design and MOST, to address these gaps. ROADmAP will test 4
evidence- and theory-based (Social Cognitive Theory [SCT]) behavior change intervention
components, developed and piloted by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Immigrant Health and Cancer
Disparities Center, and which include DPP and Look AHEAD features. We will use MOST to
identify which of the 4 components contribute most significantly and cost-effectively to weight loss
among NYC drivers recruited at workplace health fairs (HFs) and virtually. Objectives are to
apply MOST to design an optimized version of a scalable, lifestyle intervention for taxi/FHV
drivers, and then to conduct a mixed methods multistakeholder process evaluation to
facilitate widespread intervention implementation."

Most tumors are not homogeneous, but rather comprised of highly distinct and heterogenous cancer cell
populations. Adjacent cells within a tumor may harbor different genetic alterations and have different phenotypes.
Thus, complex tumors are more 'than the sum of their parts', which contributes to aggressiveness, metastatic
potential, and drug resistance. This complexity of intratumor heterogeneity is a major challenge in cancer
therapy. In contrast to normal cells in which chromosome segregation is tightly controlled to maintain a diploid
chromosome set, cancer cells are frequently aneuploid. Indeed, abnormal gains or losses of chromosomes are
amongst the most common characteristics of cancer cells with nearly all solid cancers exhibiting some type of
aneuploidy. A high degree of tumor aneuploidy also correlates with poor clinical outcomes. Although this strong
correlation between aneuploidy and cancer is well known, causal relationships are incompletely understood.
Especially in normal tissues and during early stages of carcinogenesis, chromosome segregation errors are rare
and transient events that are notoriously difficult to study. To advance our understanding how chromosome
segregation errors drive cancer initiation, development, evolution, and heterogeneity and enable novel types of
model systems to, for example, explore aneuploidy as a therapeutic target in patient-derived cancer organoids,
this pilot project proposes to develop a molecular and imaging toolkit to observe and manipulate chromosome
segregation dynamics with high spatial and temporal accuracy in three-dimensional model and patient-derived
cancer organoids. In Aim 1, we develop methods to identify, count and track specific chromosomes during
multiple cell divisions in cancer organoids. Two proposed approaches involve endonuclease-deactivated dCas9
combined with gRNAs to create unique chromosome-specific spectral barcodes or using dCas9 imaging of
repetitive DNA sequences to generate chromosome-specific fluorescence patterns, with the long-term goal of
enabling ""live karyotyping"" in cancer organoids using deep learning networks. In Aim 2, we develop three
alternative strategies to control chromosome dynamics and integrity using optogenetics. The proposed
optogenetic actuators include a light-controlled kinetochore-microtubule interface, an optogenetic chromosome
trap to immobilize specific chromosomes during cytokinesis, and photoactivated Cas9 to produce acentric
chromosome arms or induce chromothripsis. The effectiveness of these strategies will be evaluated in mammary
epithelial and breast cancer models, with the goal of understanding how acutely induced segregation errors or
chromothripsis of specific chromosomes affects cancer cell dynamics and tumor evolution."

 PTEN is a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase that antagonizes signaling downstream of growth factor
receptors. Mutations in PTEN have been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
macrocephaly. Further, experimental deletion of Pten in the mouse brain causes macrocephaly and deficits in
social behavior, suggesting a causative role in the development of ASD. In neurons, Pten knockout results in
aberrant growth and increased excitatory synaptic function. Thus, studying Pten fits with our long-term goal of
understanding how synaptic connectivity and activity contribute to cognitive and emotional functions. My central
hypothesis is that PTEN dysfunction causes aberrant neuronal growth leading to altered synaptic circuit
formation during development.
 Guided by this hypothesis, the specific aims of this proposal will strengthen our understanding of the
molecular and neurophysiological basis of ASD. Manipulation of Pten in vivo presents a unique opportunity to
examine the neurophysiological basis of ASD in a model organism. Our first aim will test our central
hypothesis by determining the downstream signaling intermediates necessary for neuronal growth,
synapse formation, and increased excitability after Pten knockout. We have discovered that cytoskeletal
polymerization rate is increased in dendritic growth cones of neurons lacking Pten. We hypothesize that the
change in polymerization rate is not dependent on mTORC1 or protein synthesis and therefore represents a
parallel molecular pathway that could be targeted for treatment. Understanding the molecular mechanisms
underlying these cellular phenotypes could lead to new treatments for ASDs. Our second aim will define how
PTEN dependent cytoskeletal polymerization contributes to neuronal growth and synapse function and
test if this is mTORC2 dependent. A gap in our understanding of neuronal cell biology exists because signaling
downstream of Pten has been largely defined in immortalized cell lines. Thus, we do not know the requirements
for specific signaling intermediates regulating translation and cytoskeletal remodeling in specialized processes
such as dendritic branching, filopodial growth, and synapse formation. I hypothesize that PTEN function must
be regulated in distinct subcellular compartments to regulate soma migration and growth versus dendritic growth
and synapse formation. For the third aim, we will test subcellular localization of PTEN necessary to
regulate neuronal growth, synapse formation, and synapse function.
 This proposal will use innovative genetic approaches to both knockout endogenous mouse genes and
replace them with mutated forms in vivo. The strategy of gene knockout and molecular substitution will allow us
to test specific mechanisms regulating neuronal development and function. The broad goal of this research is
to understand the molecular basis of neuronal dendritic arborization facilitating synaptic contact and function."
10818251,"Abstract. Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by recurrent swelling of cutaneous tissues, gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Almost all
cases are caused by deficiency in plasma C1-esterase inhibitor (C1EI, a serine protease inhibitor coded
by SERPING1 which functions to regulate the contact, complement and fibrinolytic systems. The
deficiency of C1EI leads to uncontrolled, spontaneous activation of C1 and consumption of C2 and C4,
resulting in increased levels of bradykinin which promotes vascular leak. Our focus is to restore functional
levels of C1 esterase inhibitor by providing a copy of the human C1EI cDNA by gene therapy. ENYX
Therapeutics, an early-stage biotechnology company, is collaborating with the R. Crystal laboratory at
Weill Cornell to develop adeno-associated (AAV)-mediated gene therapy for HAE. In a murine model of
C1EI deficiency, one-time administration of an AAVrh.10 gene transfer vector expressing human C1EI
(AAVrh.10hC1EI, ENX05) provides sustained C1EI activity levels in plasma, sufficient to prevent
angioedema episodes. AAVrh10.hC1EI-treated mice displayed a marked decrease in dye extravasation in
paws and organs, compared with untreated littermates, i.e., a single treatment with ENX05 has the
potential to provide long-term protection from angioedema attacks. The goal of this phase 1 STTR is the
next step in translation of this therapy to humans: demonstration of the safety of the therapy. As detailed in
the proposal, C1EI deficient mice were corrected with an ENX05 dose of 4x1012 gc/kg, a dose for which
prior studies have shown that the AAVrh.10 capsid should not pose a safety risk. However, there is the
theoretical risk that overexpression of C1EI could evoke dysfunction of the complement system. We will
test this in nonhuman primates. Specific aim 1. To assess the hypothesis that overexpression of
ENYX05 (AAVrh.10hC1EI) will not cause dysfunction of the complement system. We will assess the
complement system (serum CH50, AH50, C3, C4) and other safety parameters in male and female
nonhuman primates (NHP) following high dose (1013 gc/kg) intravenous administration of ENX05 (to
assess ENX05 administration without preexisting anti-AAVrh.10 immunity) and then in the same NHP over
the next 6 wk following a 2nd high dose (1013 gc/kg) intravenous administration of ENX05 (to assess
ENX05 administration in the context of existing anti-AAVrh.10 immunity). Controls will include nonhuman
primates treated with AAVrh.10Null, a vector identical to ENX05 but without the human C1EI coding
sequence. At the end of the study, all major organs will be assessed at the histologic level. With this study,
assuming there is no observed dysfunction in the complement system evoked by ENX05, we will have
eliminated an important theoretical safety issue in the translation of ENX05 to the clinic."
10818280,"Mechanistic and Translational Investigations of HSPB8-associated dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy.
 Autosomal dominant mutations in the heat shock protein family B member 8 (HSPB8) have been
associated with (i) distal hereditary motor neuropathy; (ii) axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease; and (iii) most
recently autosomal dominant rimmed vacuolar myopathy (RVM). Patients with HSPB8 RVM primarily develop a
distal myopathy in their 30s-40s, with proximal limb girdle weakness in their 40s-50s, and eventually become
wheelchair-bound. Muscle biopsy shows fatty replacement, fibrosis, and rimmed vacuoles. HSPB8 is involved in
chaperone-assisted selective autophagy (CASA), and in conjunction with BAG3, recognizes and promotes the
autophagy-mediated removal of misfolded proteins. Our long-term goal is to develop a potent therapy to
stop/reduce the progression of HSPB8-associated dominant-rimmed vacuolar myopathy. Major gaps: The
mechanisms through which mutant HSPB8 results in aggregation, and the availability of treatments that preserve
or restore proteostasis by enhancing autophagy for HSPB8-rimmed vacuolar myopathies. Preliminary results:
To investigate, in vitro and in vivo, the molecular mechanism of HSPB8-associated myopathy, and to assess the
potential of new treatments, we generated: (i) patient myoblasts derived from induced pluripotent cell lines
(iPSCs); and (ii) a clinically relevant C57BL/6NJ-Hspb8 knock-in mouse model with the c.515dupC variant using
CRISPR/Cas9 technology which manifests myopathic weakness starting at 6 months. We demonstrated that the
HSPB8 fs mutant is associated with: (A) increased TDP-43 and autophagy markers in the patient muscle,
fibroblasts, and myoblasts. (B) The Hspb8 knock-in mouse muscle histology revealed central nuclei and muscle
degeneration with fibrous and adipose replacement; and immunohistochemical and biochemical studies
revealed aggregates, increased TDP-43, and autophagy pathology resembling human pathology. Our group
performed two high-throughput drug screenings and identified colchicine and trehalose to reduce the aggregates,
additionally, trehalose benefitted a mouse model of neurodegeneration. Hypothesis: Based on both in vitro and
in vivo studies, our central hypothesis is that mutated HSPB8 exerts a toxic gain of function, and leads to HSPB8
mutant aggregation. Our current results support the hypothesis that compounds that stimulate autophagy favor
the removal of protein aggregates related to HSPB8 fs mutations. Specific Aims: To test our hypothesis, we
propose three specific aims: Aim 1: To investigate the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis of HSPB8-
associated myopathy in vitro patient iPSC-derived myoblasts and the Hspb8515dupC mouse model. Aim 2: To
reverse the mutant HSPB8 pathology in vitro in patient myoblasts with an autophagy inducer trehalose. Aim 3:
To stop or reduce the HSPB8-associated myopathy by upregulating autophagy in the mutant mouse model.
Based on our previous studies, we will use trehalose in vivo in the Hspb8515dupC mouse model. Successful
completion of the present mechanistic and translational study will pave the way for the treatment of HSPB8-
associated dominant-rimmed vacuolar myopathy, and will also benefit other related disorders."

This mentored International Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from UC Davis and Mahidol
University-Thailand will support Dr. Kristen Aiemjoy, Assistant Professor of Epidemiology, to establish an
impactful, independent global health research program developing seroepidemiologic tools to measure and
reduce the burden on infectious diseases globally. In Thailand, a priority research need is scalable tools to
understand the population-level burden for etiologies of acute fever, with acute undifferentiated fever being the
second-leading cause of care-seeking nationwide. To meet this need, the scope of this K01 is to evaluate
innovative and pragmatic seroepidemiologic tools to characterize the population-level burden of three etiologies
of acute undifferentiated fever: scrub typhus, melioidosis, and typhoid fever. The Specific Aims are Aim 1A) To
model longitudinal antibody responses for scrub typhus and melioidosis and estimate peak antibody response,
decay rate, and decay shape, and Aim 1B) To determine if antibody responses vary according to age; Aim 2)
To develop an analytic approach for estimating the seroincidence of scrub typhus, melioidosis and typhoid fever
from cross-sectional survey data; and Aim 3) To quantify the magnitude of selection bias induced by a school-
based sample relative to a random population-based sample when estimating the incidence of scrub typhus,
melioidosis, and typhoid fever. Data sources for the research strategy include existing longitudinal data from
confirmed melioidosis, scrub typhus, and typhoid fever cases; high-dimensional simulated data; and prospective
population-level serosurveys in Nong Khai province in Northeast Thailand. The research aims are paired with
training goals designed to provide Dr. Aiemjoy with the skills and experiences necessary to build an independent
global health research program. The specific training goals are to 1) acquire technical proficiency in the
fundamental immunology of scrub typhus, enteric fever, melioidosis infections relevant for seroepidemiology; 2)
establish expertise in innovative analytic approaches and computation tools for serologic data; and 3) cultivate
the leadership, professional skills, and research partnerships necessary to become an independent global health
research scientist. The training plan will be guided by a team of experienced mentors led by Dr. Narisara
Chantratita (primary co-mentor, Mahidol University), a globally recognized leader in melioidosis immunology with
over 30 years of clinical and laboratory infectious disease research in Thailand. Dr. Jason Andrews (primary co-
mentor, Stanford University), a clinical scientist with expertise in statistical inference and mathematical modeling,
will provide mentorship to evaluate diagnostics and interventions for tropical infectious diseases. The prolonged
field experience and collaborative research supported by this IRSDA-K01, coupled with strong institutional
support from UC Davis (Dr. Pollock, UCD Chair of Public Health Sciences and professional development
mentor), will cultivate a sustained international research partnership with Dr. Aiemjoy and Mahidol University
aimed at reducing the burden of infectious disease in Thailand and Globally."
10934599,"Project Summary/Abstract
Older adults are disproportionately affected by falls. Older adults who have memory loss (mild to moderate
cognitive impairment) can forget to wear wireless alert pendants or wristbands that are used in case they fall in
their home. Falls among adults 65 and older caused over 34,000 deaths in 2019, making it the leading cause
of injury death for that group. Older adult falls cost $50 billion in medical costs annually. Of those who fall,
many suffer serious injuries, such as hip fractures and head traumas, which reduces their mobility,
independence, and life expectancy. Studies have found an increased risk of complications associated with
prolonged periods of lying on the floor following a fall. Older adults living alone or with memory loss are at the
greatest risk of delayed assistance following a fall and cannot always be counted on to use their wearable
emergency alert button. A low-cost, unobtrusive system capable of automatically detecting and alerting falls in
the homes of older adults living alone or those with mild to moderate cognitive impairment, could help
significantly reduce the incidence of delayed assistance after a fall.
This phase II project, building on a successful phase I project, will develop an innovative new in-home fall
monitoring system that solves many practical problems with existing systems. The technical approach uses
structured light sensing (SLS) that creates 3D point clouds of a scene to allow detection of motion sequences
using machine learning (ML) algorithms which will allow for the automatic detection of a person’s fall. There are
multiple benefits of this approach for the target users: 1. The person is not required to carry or wear an
electronic device that might be forgotten to be worn. 2. No action is required to be taken by the person after a
fall. 3. The system does not use visible light video that would create privacy concerns for the person. 4. The
system can work in darkness or very low light unlike visible light camera-based approaches. 5. The system is
unobtrusive and works with existing Personal Emergency Response Systems (PERS), with minimal or no
active user interaction.
The SLS fall detection system is intended to work with multiple vendors of in-home alert systems. It will operate
in lieu of or in parallel with, wearable buttons to signal an alert. The proposed system would be used if
caregivers determine that a wearable button is not an adequate solution for the person being monitored. The
proposed devices will be mounted high on the wall of each room and will wirelessly communicate to a central
device in the home. The central device will send the alert to the in-home alert system upon detecting a fall. The
proposed solution will not require any Internet connectivity. The out-of-home communication method is
provided by the chosen vendor of the in-home alert system."
10820493,"Abstract
The purpose of this grant application is to promote the excellence in biomedical research of underrepresented
graduate and undergraduate students of the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus. World-wide,
cancer related deaths continue to increase due to their ability to become chemotherapy resistant and
metastasize. For women with ovarian cancer, a staggering 70% will become resistant to the front-line therapy,
cisplatin. While the mechanism of cisplatin resistance has been extensively studied, no effective treatments have
resulted, making such research critical and important. During the search for new therapeutic strategies to reverse
these horrendous trends, we identified matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3) to be highly abundant in cisplatin
resistant ovarian cancer cells, as compared to responsive ones, using differential gene expression studies. Our
seminal findings have further demonstrated that ovarian cancer tumors with high MMP3 levels relapse at a faster
rate than those expressing lower levels, further supporting the notion that this enzyme plays a key role in disease
progression. MMP3 belongs to the MMPs family of proteolytic enzymes that degrade multiple components of the
extracellular matrix (ECM). The protein structure of MMPs includes a catalytic domain and a hemopexin (HPX)
domain. Several synthetic and natural MMP inhibitors have been designed to inhibit the catalytic domain of
MMPs. However, these studies were abandoned years ago due to the overt toxicities resulting from the non-
specific profile of those inhibitors. However, exciting data from our laboratory seeks to reverse these
disappointing trends by demonstrating that MMP3-targeting small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) significantly
reduced cell proliferation and the invasiveness ability of cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells. We did not
observe reduced proliferation or invasiveness when we used an inhibitor that binds to the catalytic domain of the
MMP3. Our preliminary results are in agreement with evidence that the HPX domain of MMP3 could binds to
proteins connecting the ECM with intracellular molecular pathways. Therefore, we are poised to examine not
only the contribution of MMP3 to the cisplatin resistance, but also to identify associated proteins that might
contribute to this disease and they themselves represent new therapeutic targets for investigation. Therefore,
we plan to test our hypothesis that other regions of MMP3 (HPX domain) interact with proteins promoting cisplatin
resistance. Using a combination of molecular biology tools and our extensive and well established ovarian
cancer models, we will test this central hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) determine whether MMP3
in ovarian cancer models mediates susceptibility to the chemotherapy agent cisplatin, (2) identify the protein
directly interacting with MMP3 in cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells, and (3) determine the biological
consequences and therapeutic effects of siRNA-mediated MMP3 targeting in ovarian cancer models. Results of
this research project have the potential to provide impact by enhancing understanding of therapy resistance
and non-catalytic functions of MMP3 in ovarian cancer."

Summary
 Our research focuses on uncovering the molecular mechanisms of a form of non-Hebbian synaptic
plasticity, namely homeostatic synaptic plasticity. In contrast to the self-reinforcing nature of Hebbian plasticity,
homeostatic plasticity operates under different rules as a “corrective” mechanism to prevent run-away Hebbian
plasticity. Compared to Hebbian plasticity, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying homeostatic
synaptic plasticity is much less understood, and their implication in neuropsychiatric disorders is largely
unexplored. Work from our labs in the past years show that retinoic acid (RA) signaling, a major signaling
pathway mediating homeostatic synaptic plasticity, is severely impaired in the absence of FMRP expression,
resulting in a lack of homeostatic plasticity in both mouse and human FXS neurons. Moreover, we demonstrate
that under a more natural, enriched environment, compromised homeostatic synaptic plasticity in adult mice
induces run away Hebbian plasticity as manifested by greatly enhanced LTP and diminished LTD. As a
behavioral consequence, animals with defective homeostatic plasticity exhibit enhanced learning but reduced
behavioral flexibility when raised in enriched environment. Together, our work establishes a link between
synaptic RA signaling, homeostatic plasticity and cognitive function, and suggests that impaired homeostatic
plasticity may contribute to cognitive deficits in FXS. The goal of the proposed research project is to gain further
understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of RA-dependent homeostatic plasticity. Specifically,
we will focus on three aspects of RA signaling in the context of homeostatic synaptic plasticity: the trans-synaptic
cell adhesion molecule neurexins, the BDNF-TrkB retrograde signaling, and the functional interaction between
FMRP and RA receptor RARα. Together, results from this proposed study will identify new candidate molecular
tools for investigating in vivo function of homeostatic synaptic plasticity, and also provide insight into discovering
new drug targets for treating FXS and potentially other mental disorders.
Relevance
This project will investigate molecular mechanisms through which synaptic RA signaling regulates synaptic
strength in a homeostatic manner. Recent studies using FXS model mice and human FXS patient neurons
establish that defective RA-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity is a major synaptic dysfunction phenotype
associated with fragile-x syndrome. Thus, uncovering additional molecular players critically involved in
homeostatic plasticity will provide the opportunity to discover new drug targets for treating FXS and other forms
of mental illness in which circuit maladaptation due to compromised homeostatic plasticity is a major contributor
to disease symptoms.

10824264,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The purpose of this proposal is to develop clinical prediction tools to risk stratify patients with
pulmonary sarcoidosis. Because the course of sarcoidal inflammation lasts for many years even
in those with self-limiting sarcoid, the lack of prognostic indicators upon which to develop a
management plan is not a trivial issue for both patient and physician. Thus, without
prognostication tools, clinicians will not be able to improve the longitudinal care they provide for
the types of outcomes that are used in the clinic. The conception of this study was motivated by
the preliminary data showing that levels of blood protein and RNA transcripts related to interferon
inflammation were predictive of future declines in lung function using Cox proportional hazards
modeling. An important feature of the study design is the focus on clinically relevant outcomes
and clinical variables so that results can be immediately translated into clinical practice. This goal
is realized in Aim 1 in which we will deliver the best performing clinical prediction model that relies
only on clinically available data and lab tests to predict a clinical outcome used in pulmonary
clinics to define sarcoidosis disease progression. This outcome is a clinically meaningful decline
in lung function. In Aim 2, we will measure the added value of incorporating novel blood-based
interferon related markers into the clinical prediction models. The goal of this Aim is to identify
which novel markers should be developed and moved into the clinical arena for use in sarcoidosis
prognostication. Finally, in Aim 3 we will apply these models to an important clinical management
problem in sarcoidosis which is identifying the optimal monitoring frequency for a given patient.
Addressing this last question is the first step towards being able to better anticipate disease
progression before extensive organ damage occurs. The team of sarcoidosis investigators are
highly qualified to execute this study because they have a track record of performing sarcoidosis
clinical research, have ongoing collaborations and have participated in prior studies that involve
biospecimen collection from patients including NIH-sponsored consortium studies. To execute
this study, the investigators will contribute longitudinal biospecimens and clinical data from 357
patients with sarcoidosis that have been enrolled in longitudinal cohorts at centers across the US.
Two hundred additional patients will be enrolled and followed for up to 39 months leading to a
total sample size of 557, of which a majority will be African American. Our team also includes a
uniquely qualified biostatistician, Dr. Charles McCulloch, who has pioneered aspects of the
longitudinal modeling approach we will be using. Therefore, the proposed Aims have a high
likelihood of success for tackling this long-overdue clinical problem."

10824386,"ABSTRACT: The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how the gain-of-function MUC5B promoter
variant affects transcriptional regulation and gene expression that are common to clinically distinct types of usual
interstitial pneumonia (UIP). UIP was initially described as a morphologic entity, however, recently has been
defined using specific pathologic and radiographic criteria. While UIP is characteristic of idiopathic pulmonary
fibrosis (IPF), these pathologic and radiographic patterns of chronic fibrosing interstitial pneumonia are also
typical of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), rheumatoid arthritis-associated interstitial lung disease
(RA-ILD), asbestosis, and several drug-induced lung diseases. The gain-of-function promoter variant in MUC5B
(rs35705950) is the dominant risk factor for IPF, is present in >50% of affected patients, and has also been
reported to be the dominant genetic risk variant for the development of CHP and RA-ILD. However, while IPF is
by definition idiopathic, CHP develops following repeated exposure to organic antigens, and RA-ILD is a
complication of rheumatoid arthritis. We proposed by understanding the relationship between the MUC5B
promoter variant, transcriptional regulation, and gene expression in IPF, CHP, and RA-ILD, we will be able to
identify the common molecular elements that are critical to the development of UIP. The two critical questions
that we plan to address are: 1) what are the common molecular features of UIP, irrespective of clinical context,
and 2) does MUC5B promoter variant have a unique molecular signature common to UIP? The hypothesis we
plan to test is that the gain-of-function MUC5B promoter variant drives cell-specific chromatin
accessibility and gene expression that define UIP. In Aim 1, we will use single nucleus RNA sequencing
(snRNA-seq) to identify the cell-specific transcriptional profiles for IPF, CHP, and RA-ILD, and determine the
relationship of the common cell-specific transcriptional profiles of UIP to the MUC5B promoter variant. In Aim 2,
we will use a combinatorial indexing single nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq)
to identify the cell-specific chromatin accessibility profiles for IPF, CHP, and RA-ILD, and determine the
relationship of the common cell-specific chromatin accessibility profiles of UIP to the MUC5B promoter variant.
In Aim 3, we will perform integrative analyses of the MUC5B promoter genotype, snRNA-seq, and snATAC-seq
data using single-cell expression QTL, multi-omic and network inference methods to identify UIP-specific gene
regulatory networks with key drivers of UIP in specific cell types. In Aim 4, we will validate the transcriptional
features that are common to MUC5B-associated UIP by determining the relationship of these key genes to the
pathogenic heterogeneity of UIP and relevant in vitro biology. In aggregate, we will characterize regulatory
effects of MUC5B on cell-specific transcriptional profiles and networks in UIP, launching investigation of novel
pathogenic mechanisms and drug targets for these incurable diseases."
10824388,"Project Summary/Abstract
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. Even with
intensive surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis is still dismal. Completely removal (negative
surgical margin) with surgery is the goal of the treatment, but it is difficult to achieve due to the infiltration of
vital structures. Since positive surgery margin is associated with poor prognosis, there is a great need to
develop novel treatments which could not only guide the surgery but also destroy the residual tumors while
sparing normal tissues with important functions. Moreover, development of theranostic agents that can detect
and eliminate early HNSCC lesions, particularly the aggressive sub-types, will have tremendous impact in
many patients with HNSCC. We recently developed a set of highly innovative Transformable Nano-
Theranostics (TNTs) that possess outstanding capability to circumvent the sequential biological barriers which
have generally hindered drug delivery to tumors including HNSCC. We have demonstrated that 1) the smart
dual size/charge- transformation of TNTs in response to tumor acidosis could dramatically increase the tumor
accumulation and penetration of TNTs in HNSCC tissue, and facilitate uptake in cancer cells; 2) TNTs enabled
effective visualization of tumor, drug delivery and therapeutic effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
near infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRFI); 3) the synergistic trimodal therapy via TNTs achieved a 100%
complete cure rate in orthotopic HNSCC mouse models. These highly encouraging data suggest that such
nano-platform can be translated into early detection and elimination of HNSCC lesions, which are readily
accessible to illumination with light. The goal of this proposal is to tackle the biological barriers and
translational barriers of theranostic agents via the development of highly effective, non-toxic yet easy-to-make
targeting Transformable Nano-Theranostics (t-TNTs) for image-guided intervention using companion cats with
spontaneous HNSCC. In aim 1, a robust set of t-TNT nanoconstructs with HNSCC targeting ligand will be
developed, optimized and fully characterized. In aim 2, the biodistribution and tumor targeting properties of the
selected t-TNTs will be studied with optical imaging and MRI in orthotopic HNSCC model. The in vivo toxicity
and anti-tumor efficacy of the top t-TNTs will be evaluated in HNSCC xenograft models including PDX models.
The best t-TNT nanoconstruct selected from aim 2 will be used for image-guided treatment studies in aim 3 in
cats with spontaneous HNSCC. Successful development of such theranostic agents will significantly enhance
the delivery of imaging agents and synergistic therapies of HNSCC while the therapeutic delivery process can
be monitored at various spatial and temporal resolution scales. Results from this study will be significant not
only in advancing the development of next-generation nano-theranostics for effective imaging & therapy of
HNSCC, but also in generating new fundamental knowledge of using transformable nanotheranostics for
overcoming a variety of biological barriers to enhance the efficiency of image-guided drug delivery in cancers."

The objective of our Cooperative Center for Human Immunology (CCHI) is to use the analysis of
vaccine induced immunity and natural infections to Influenza and Sars COV-2 as a model for defining
adaptive and innate immune mechanisms and antiviral protection in adults. The Clinical Core will be
responsible for coordinating protocol design and implementation to maximize opportunities for parallel
evaluations across the research projects and scientific cores, obtaining human subjects approvals,
and creating and managing the centralized database to record clinical data. The Clinical Core will
coordinate distribution of relevant specimens to the HIMC Core and provide matched de-identified
clinical data for analysis. As the work proceeds, the Clinical Core database will facilitate comparative
analyses of results obtained from the individual research projects. One of the goals of the Clinical
Core is to make the necessary IRB submissions for clinical studies, recruit and enroll adults into the
protocols, assure that participant rights are respected throughout the duration of their trial participation
and provide follow-up to assure collection of complete sets of data from all subjects. Participant
reimbursement payments will be provided by the core. We will provide centralized clinical data
management for research projects and other cores using an electronic database with electronic data
entry and implement a quality management plan to assure data integrity. These data will then be made
available to the research projects and scientific cores for final data analysis. Biospecimens (blood)
and clinical data will be collected by the Clinical Core staff according to the specifications of each
clinical study protocol and delivered either to the CTRU laboratory or directly to research project staff."
10824443,"Bleeding resulting from factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) can occur in any tissue including the brain. Current
treatments, including factor VIII (FVIII) replacement and recent novel therapeutics, focus primarily on joint
health. In spite of advancements in treatment options, disabilities remain. People with hemophilia suffer from
increased rates of mental health disorders compared to age and sex matched controls (45% vs. 18.5%). While
significant progress has been made in prevention and treatment of hemophilia-related joint and muscle disease
with current standards of care, there is a paucity of research in hemophilia A to understand, treat, or prevent
brain disease. The long-term goal is to find diagnostic and treatment approaches that address the mechanism
and structure of neurologic disease in hemophilia A. The objective of this proposal is to examine the role of
FVIII deficiency on neurologic function and structure. The central hypothesis is that cerebral microbleeds and
neuroinflammation lead to changes in brain structure, causing behavioral changes in hemophilia A mice. The
rationale underlying this proposal is that completion will identify mechanisms causing poor neurologic
outcomes in hemophilia A. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1)
Examine cerebral microbleeds and neuroanatomy phenotypes in hemophilia A mice. Aim 2) Investigate glial
activation and neuroinflammation in hemophilia A mice. Aim 3) Identify the role of FVIII replacement in
neuropsychiatric behavioral phenotypes in hemophilia A mice. We will pursue these aims using innovative
quantitative neuroimaging and gene transfer techniques to evaluate brain structure and function in hemophilia
animal model over time. The proposed research is significant because we will gain insights into the
neuroanatomic changes and neuroinflammatory pathways impacted in a model of FVIII deficiency. The
expected outcome of this work is that lack of FVIII will result in significant neurologic abnormalities. The results
will have an important positive impact because they will establish a better understanding of the developing
brain structure and function in FVIII deficiency, and long-term will improve cognitive, psychiatric, and quality of
life outcomes for people with hemophilia A."

10805665,"Project Summary/Abstract: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a small vessel disease characterized by the
deposition of amyloid-β in the walls of cortical and leptomeningeal blood vessels of the brain, is a leading cause
of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in the elderly. Patients with CAA present clinically with hemorrhagic lesions,
including acute symptomatic lobar ICH, convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH), and the chronic
manifestation of cSAH, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS). There are currently no effective treatments for
hemorrhage prevention in CAA, in part due to limitations in our understanding of the mechanisms leading to
vessel rupture and hemorrhage. Recent studies suggest that leptomeningeal bleeding is an important risk factor
in the development of lobar ICH. The proposed research focuses on the central hypothesis that severe
leptomeningeal CAA and leptomeningeal bleeding (including cSAH and cSS) cause CAA-related lobar
ICH. The applicant will use a multimodal approach including ex vivo MRI-targeted neuropathological examination
of human brain tissue and complementary in vivo imaging of mouse models of CAA. Inflammatory-mediated
leptomeningeal vascular remodeling will be explored as a putative cause of leptomeningeal bleeding and
potentially lobar ICH. Additionally, the consequences of leptomeningeal bleeding for the underlying cortex and
cortical vasculature will be investigated. Inflammation secondary to blood products is hypothesized to be a crucial
mechanistic link between initial leptomeningeal bleeding and rupture of additional blood vessels leading to ICH.
This hypothesis will be explored in human brain tissue and in two complementary animal models of cSAH/cSS
developed by the applicant. Importantly, patients with CAA typically present to clinical attention when the
underlying vessel pathology has significantly progressed, and bleeding events have begun to occur. The
overarching goal of these studies is to identify novel, and urgently needed, treatment targets for
hemorrhage prevention, accessible at the time of symptomatic patient presentation.
 The proposed experiments and career development plan build on the applicant’s strong background in
in vivo optical imaging of rodent models, with the career development plan focused on expanding the applicant’s
knowledge base in advanced neuropathology and neuroinflammation through experimental training, formal
coursework, conferences, and mentorship. The excellent scientific environment and resources of Massachusetts
General Hospital and Harvard Medical School as well as the applicant’s outstanding mentorship team (including
mentor, co-mentor, and scientific advisory board) of internationally recognized leaders in the fields of CAA,
ICH/SAH, in vivo optical imaging, neuropathology, and neuroinflammation, will be critical to the applicant’s career
development and completion of the proposed work. This K08 award will be instrumental in the applicant’s
progression to a successful independent career as a clinician-scientist focused on ICH."
10808042,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Status epilepticus affects approximately 160,000 people in the U.S. each year and carries substantial
associated morbidity and mortality. Use of prehospital benzodiazepines by EMS providers varies widely,
resulting in failures to provide evidence-based care to a large proportion of patients. Despite the striking
underuse of prehospital benzodiazepines for status epilepticus, the causes and the clinical consequence have
not been fully delineated. Prehospital providers may hesitate to administer benzodiazepines because the
respiratory risks of undertreated seizures may be perceived as less morbid than the respiratory depression
caused by medication-related oversedation. Alternatively, prehospital care may be driven by variable
emergency medical services treatment protocols that frequently define status epilepticus incorrectly and
instruct providers to give benzodiazepine doses lower than established guidelines. Accordingly, the overall
objective of this proposal is to discover the key factors that dictate prehospital status epilepticus management
and quantify the extent to which our current shortcomings are associated with worse outcomes. The advent of
more detailed EMS electronic medical records and linkage of these records to hospital data provide a new
opportunity to examine these questions with increased rigor. The results will be critical in addressing the
clinical concerns of front-line providers and improving outcomes among patients with status epilepticus through
the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Assess the association between undertreated status epilepticus and clinical outcomes.
Aim 2. Determine the association between prehospital benzodiazepine dose and EMS agency protocol
instructions for status epilepticus.
Aim 3. Identify barriers and facilitators to evidence-based benzodiazepine administration for patients with out-
of-hospital status epilepticus using qualitative methods.
Through the proposed research, relevant coursework, and a mentoring team with wide-ranging expertise, Dr.
Guterman will build necessary skills in study design and advanced biostatistical methods (Dr. Daniel
Lowenstein, the primary mentor, and Dr. John Neuhaus), implementation science (Dr. S. Andrew Josephson
and Dr. Sara Ackerman), and qualitative and mixed methods research (Dr. Sara Ackerman). The findings from
this project will address an understudied aspect of status epilepticus care and provide insight needed to
improve its prehospital treatment. The results will build the evidence base for a future R01 proposal to
prospectively evaluate prehospital treatment and outcomes in patients presenting with status epilepticus. This
project will also bring Dr. Guterman closer to her long-term goal of becoming a leading clinician-investigator
dedicated to advancing the treatment of status epilepticus and ensuring that real-world care for these patients
matches the best available evidence."

Antihyperlipidemic agents, including statins, currently rank as the second most frequently prescribed drugs in
the U.S. While there is adequate evidence supporting the benefits of statins for the prevention of CVD events,
evidence to support the beneficial or harmful effects of statins on cognition and the risk of Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias (ADRD) is inconclusive. Findings from two large randomized controlled trials of statins
found no effect on cognitive outcomes over the short-term (4 to 5 years). Results from observational studies
have been mixed. Given the widespread use of statins, this knowledge gap represents a huge opportunity for
illuminating viable prevention strategies for ADRD. The most plausible explanation for these inconsistent results
is that the effectiveness of statin treatment varies across patient characteristics such as age, sex, and the
presence of chronic conditions. Importantly, most trials do not have adequate statistical power to examine these
heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Further, trials typically include participants who are healthier than the
general population of statin-users and less likely to experience side effects, and often exclude participants who
do not tolerate statins. Large, administrative observational data sources can provide sufficient sample sizes to
address these limitations, but traditional analytical techniques are insufficient in the presence of strong
confounding. In this study, we propose to leverage a widespread clinical prescription guideline and established
statistical methods in economics, specifically regression discontinuity (RD) designs, to address confounding and
approximate a randomized trial. Our data (N=175,234) will come from the Health Improvement Network (THIN)
database which includes general practices in the UK covering about 5% of the total population. In 2008, the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK passed a guideline which recommends statin use
when a patient’s 10-year CVD risk score exceeds 20%. Since treatment is given or withheld according to this
guideline, we assume that patients who are “near” the 20% cutoff will be similar except for the treatment received,
thus creating the ideal setup to estimate the causal effect of statins. We will also apply an honest causal forest,
a state-of-the-art causal inference and supervised learning method, to flexibly identify novel patient subgroups
who could most benefit from statin use. The proposed research will (Aim 1) estimate the effect of statins on
ADRD risk, using an RD design, accounting for adherence. We will (Aim 2) then estimate the effect of statins on
ADRD risk across a priori (hypothesis-driven HTEs) and newly identified (data-driven HTEs) patient subgroups,
using RD and machine-learning methods. Finally, we will (Aim 3) quantify the reduction in ADRD cases that
could be achieved if specific subgroups of the population are treated with statins. Using contemporary methods,
this innovative study will provide more valid and public health relevant estimates of the effects of statins on ADRD
risk. By also examining HTEs and identifying groups that may particularly benefit or be harmed from statins, this
study will allow us to move towards targeted “precision medicine” approach for the prevention of ADRD."
10807412,"Project Summary/Abstract
Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening but exacts an outsized toll on patients and the healthcare system. This
system’s burden is due in part to one size fits all national guidelines that necessitate emergency department
(ED) care for all patients and ≥ 4-6-hour observational periods that are agnostic to reaction severity and patient
characteristics. This generic approach is ill-suited to most reactions, thereby contributing to ED overutilization,
long ED wait times, ED overcrowding, avoidable hospitalizations, and inflated healthcare costs. The proposed
K23 study seeks to deliver personalized anaphylaxis care and will further develop my skillset as an independent
translational investigator. I hypothesize that machine learning can be applied to my actively enrolling KL2 cohort
to develop prediction models capable of customizing ED observation periods in real-time based on patient-
specific risk. The rationale for this hypothesis comes from preliminary KL2 data (n = 91) in which 51.6% of
patients had complete symptom resolution within 2 hours from the first epinephrine dose. The next logical step
is to expand my prospective cohort and employ machine learning to develop a model capable of predicting
time-to-symptom resolution in real-time to reduce observation periods, prevent unnecessary hospitalizations,
and identify patients who may not require ED care and can instead be safely managed at home. Additionally,
there is an unmet need for clinically actionable biomarkers to enhance patient risk stratification and enable
customizable therapeutic approaches; however, there is an incomplete understanding of immunological
mechanisms contributing to human anaphylaxis pathogenesis. Most research has focused on the role of IgE-
mediated mast cell and basophil activation, yet emerging data support my second hypothesis that neutrophils
are key drivers of anaphylaxis that govern divergent progression into either refractory or biphasic courses. The
rationale for this hypothesis comes from preliminary KL2 data in which 100% of patients with severe reactions
exhibited elevated markers of neutrophil activation and levels were dynamic over time. The specific aims of
this application are 1) To derive a dynamic clinical prediction model to customize anaphylaxis
observation periods. Simultaneously, I will acquire training in biostatistical and biomedical informatics,
machine learning, dynamic prediction modeling, and mediation analysis; and 2) Demonstrate that serum
biomarkers of neutrophil activation predict reaction severity and clinical courses. This aim will help me
acquire essential training in translational approaches to neutrophil biology and will provide a mechanistic
gateway for future research on the immunology of anaphylaxis courses. Findings from this study will result in a
novel prediction model to optimize anaphylaxis observation periods and prevent unnecessary hospitalizations.
These outcomes will aid my transition to independent investigator status by conducting validation studies of the
predictive model in a multicenter cohort. Study findings will also open avenues of investigation on the
integration of neutrophil measures into clinical care and the prognostic machine learning tool."
10807413,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is accompanied by progressive
neurodegeneration and stereotypic deposition of misfolded amyloid β- (Aβ) and tau proteins. However, the
basis for cellular dysfunction in AD is not well understood, underscoring an important need to broaden the
biologic scope of AD research. Technological advances, based on single-cell whole-genome sequencing
(scWGS) on frozen postmortem human brain tissue, now allow examination of previously inaccessible aspects
of the genome of individual cells in the brain. Recent research from our group has found that neurons in
individuals with AD show greater somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) in their genomes than in
individuals without AD. Using mutational signature analysis, our study also found that the specific causes of
somatic mutations differed in AD, implicating oxidative stress and signal suggesting other cytopathologic
events.
 This study aims to understand neuronal somatic mutation in AD at a deeper level, to probe how disease
progression and protein misfolding impact the burden and signatures of sSNV. The first aim will examine
neurons from individuals with different pathologic stages of AD. This will give us a better understanding of
when somatic mutations develop in disease, and whether certain mutagenic events occur with distinct timing in
the development of AD. The second aim will study how intracellular tau pathology relates to somatic mutation,
utilizing a novel method to separate individual nuclei according to tau tangle formation. In applying this method
to specific brain regions at specific pathologic stages at the forefront of AD progression, we will be able to
determine if somatic mutation is tied to tau pathology at the level of individual cells. In the final aim, we will test
whether Aβ trigger somatic mutation, using a human iPSC-derived neuronal cellular model and incubation with
human brain-derived Aβ oligomers.
 With complementary approaches of novel scWGS technology, single-nucleus sorting, and specific human
tissues and and cellular systems, we will examine the mechanistic role of neuronal somatic mutations in AD.
This examination of the interplay between disease progression, protein misfolding, and the landscape of
somatic mutations will be an important step in understanding the molecular causes of AD. Moreover, the
capability of somatic mutational signature analysis to reveal previously unrecognized disease mechanisms
lends additional promise toward development of better treatments and cures."

The lack of diversity in US biomedical and behavioral science research continues to be a significant challenge.
To address this concern, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) funded the Summer Institute
Program to Increase Diversity (SIPID) in 2006. Subsequently, the Program to Increase Diversity Among
Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research-Functional and Translational Genomics of Blood Disorders
(PRIDE-FTG) was established at Augusta University (AU). Through the PRIDE-FTG program, we have
provided mentored training for 114 underrepresented minority faculty. Mentees learned hands-on bench
research and grantsmanship skills during two consecutive Summer Institutes. Program evaluation supports
achievement of our primary goal of aiding mentees to submit an NIH or equivalent grant application within two
years of program completion; 42.3% of PRIDE-FTG mentees have NIH grant-funding as principal investigators.
In the next iteration of the PRIDE-FTG program, we included innovative components and collaboration with the
PRIDE-OHD (Obesity Health Disparities) and PRIDE-FOCUS (Future Faculty of Cardiovascular Sciences)
programs. We will test the hypothesis that a mentored training program to build research and grant-writing
skills will increase the ability of URM and disabled faculty, conducting blood disorders research to obtain
extramural funding and transition to independent research careers. Four aims will be accomplished: AIM 1.
Conduct innovative Summer Institute 1 at AU (Component 1). Mentees will participate in a grant-writing core
curriculum and hands-on-bench research training to enhance funding strategies. We will implement a K to R
Club to increase R series grant success. AIM 2. Support Small Research Project funding initiative (Component
4). In collaboration with the PRIDE Steering Committee and NHLBI program staff, we will fund pilot research
projects as administrative supplements to support competitive grant proposals addressing blood disorders
research. AIM 3. Facilitate Mentoring and Networking Activities (Component 2). Mentorship Committees
comprised of the mentee, PRIDE research mentor and home institution mentor will be established. Peer-
mentorship teams will launch within cohorts to promote collaboration. We will support a mid-year meeting at
AU to conduct a mock study section and mentee networking, and attendance at the PRIDE Coordination Core
annual meeting. AIM 4. Conduct innovative Summer Institute 2 (Component 3). Mentees will return to AU to
complete a one-on-one grant review to support the primary goal of the PRIDE program to submit an NIH or
equivalent grant application and participate in additional research experiences. The mentored training
supported by the PRIDE-FTG program will influence the number of underrepresented and disabled scientists
achieving successful biomedical research careers."

 The ability to efficiently defend one’s home territory from intruders is an essential behavioral adaptation.
However, the neurobiology of this experience-dependent plasticity is unknown. Furthermore, the neural
mechanisms in females and sex differences are also unknown; these are critical barriers of therapeutic
interventions aimed at improving mental health. My graduate research suggests that females are more
sensitive to the rewarding effects of aggressive experience and that oxytocin (OT) transmission may underlie
these sex differences. My recent post-doctoral studies support synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
and nucleus accumbens (NAc) underlies the adaptive consequences of aggressive experience. Thus, the goal
of this proposal is to synthesize my research by 1) acquiring training in state-of-the-art electrophysiological
techniques and investigate aggression-induced synaptic plasticity of PFC input to medium spiny neurons
(MSNs) in the NAc, and 2) then apply these new skills to assess the contribution of OT to synaptic plasticity of
NAc MSNs. Both phases will advance our understanding of the causal role of two distinct circuits in driving
aggression reward in both sexes, and provide the training and resources to establish my independent career.
 Under the collective mentorship of Drs. Patrick Rothwell (primary mentor), Robert Meisel (co-mentor),
state-of-the-art research facilities, and expert research consultants, I will have access to a unique and custom
set of resources. Dr. Rothwell will lead my training in slice electrophysiology, optogenetics and calcium
imaging with fiber photometry. To elucidate specific components of neuronal physiology, I will learn how to
measure the effects of aggressive experience on basal synaptic strength of NAc MSNs in male and female
Syrian hamsters. I will then assess the effects of aggressive experience on calcium signaling of NAc MSNs in
male and females. In combination, I will also utilize optogenetics to assess the involvement of PFC glutamate
projections in driving physiological changes and aggression reward in males and females. I predict enhanced
PFC synaptic transmission onto NAc MSN drives aggressive experience-dependent behavioral plasticity, e.g.
aggression reward and motivation.
 For the R00 phase I will establish an independent research lab and then implement the skills acquired
during the K99 to investigate the role of OT in NAc synaptic plasticity, as well as driving aggression reward and
motivation in males and females. OT has been historically considered a monotonic love hormone. However,
this proposal seeks to further revolutionize our understanding of the non-canonical and non-monotonic nature
of OT and improve sex-specific therapeutic strategies to combat psychiatric disease. I predict OT is a mediator
of the NAc MSN synaptic plasticity that drives the enhanced aggression reward and motivation in females
compared to males. Collectively, this proposal will provide me skills and professional development for running
a research lab that makes fundamental discoveries about brain function to combat mental illnesses."

The ability to move from one place to another and acquire different motor skills is critical for our survival. Many
human disorders including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and Tourette syndrome, cause
abnormal motor behaviors. Identifying neural circuits that mediate locomotion and motor learning are therefore
crucial both in terms of basic science and understanding how their dysfunction in disease models may
contribute to motor defects. Parafascicular (PF) thalamus has extensive connectivity within the basal ganglia
motor system, and is involved in reversal learning as well as the initiation of movement sequences. Although
heterogeneity within PF thalamic neurons has been reported at the cellular level, the functional relevance of
distinct PF subpopulations in motor behaviors remains unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
PF thalamus contains distinct projection-specific subpopulations that mediate different motor processes.
During the K99 phase, using chemogenetic neuronal inhibition and in vivo calcium imaging, I will test the
hypothesis that the thalamostriatal (PF!dorsal striatum) pathway is mainly involved in locomotion whereas the
thalamosubthalamic (PF!subthalamic nucleus) pathway is mainly involved in motor learning. By comparing
inputs from motor cortex, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra to these PF subpopulations followed by
optogenetic circuit manipulations, I will identify PF subpopulation-specific inputs that are critical for their
behavioral contributions. During the R00 phase, using ex vivo electrophysiology, I will determine how these two
PF circuits are altered in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, which will set the stage for the identification of
circuit-based manipulations that may rescue both locomotion and motor learning in this mouse model. To
further these rescue experiments, I will perform single cell RNA sequencing of the two PF subpopulations in
wild type mice to identify potential molecular targets capable of rescuing both motor phenotypes in Parkinson's
disease mice. Together, the proposed project will not only enhance our understanding regarding the role of
distinct PF circuits in motor functions, but also potentially indicate that targeting PF circuits may be sufficient to
rescue multiple motor phenotypes in neurodegenerative disease models. The proposed research and career
development plan will be conducted in the lab of Dr. Guoping Feng at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard,
which will prepare Dr. Dheeraj Roy to direct an innovative research program as an independent investigator
studying neural circuit mechanisms mediating normal and disease states."

Alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs is extensively employed by the nervous system to expand the transcriptomic
manifold. Regulated in specific cellular contexts by multiple RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), this process is a major
contributor to cellular identity that acts orthogonally to transcriptional regulation and has been implicated in many
neurodevelopmental disorders. Understanding and integrating the impact of alternative RNA splicing on the
establishment and organizational hierarchy of interneuron subtype specification is therefore of high value, though
there has been relatively little progress in this direction. To address this gap, we have designed a high throughput
system to determine the role of alternative splicing regulatory networks in cortical interneuron subtype
specification. We hypothesize that alternative splicing is an informative component of interneuron cell fate
decisions. Using scRNA-seq datasets with in-depth and full transcript read coverage across diverse neuronal
cell types, we will identify key RBPs by highly correlated expression with cell-type specific splicing patterns
together with integrative analysis of RBP target networks. We will then test the role of these RBPs by CRISPR
knockout in mESCs differentiated into interneuron subtypes using a dual interneuron lineage fluorescent reporter
line that we have developed. Training in splicing analysis in the expert environment of the Zhang lab is an ideal
complement to the trainee’s previous extensive training in interneuron biology. The proposed studies and training
plan will provide a fertile basis for a productive independent research program synthesizing traditional
neurodevelopment with state of the art bioinformatics. Alternative splicing and cellular diversity are known to be
closely intertwined and important in mature neurons; a better understanding of the inception of these
relationships will be greatly impactful to our understanding of the nervous system in health and
neurodevelopmental disease."

The effects of chronic and heavy alcohol use on individuals and communities are of major public
health and socio-economic concern. Research aimed at reducing alcohol intake and organ damage,
must be underpinned by a sound knowledge of the pathobiology of alcohol use at a cellular and
molecular level. A key resource for such research is access to high quality, extensively characterized
tissue from individuals with a history chronic alcohol use and matched controls. The NSW Brain
Tissue Resource Center (BTRC) is a brain bank that was established to facilitate research into alcohol
use and specifically alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD). The BTRC, based at The University of
Sydney, provides human post-mortem brain tissue, demographic data and clinical information, to
researchers worldwide. Tissues are collected from individuals with alcohol use disorders and controls
through a prospective donor program or retrospectively following forensic autopsy. Case selection is
based on a range of specific inclusion and exclusion criteria to maintain cohorts that are easily
matched and relatively uncomplicated by co-morbidities. Tissues are prepared so that fresh frozen,
formalin-fixed and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples are available to researchers.
Preparation and storage of tissues has been developed, and continually modified, to produce high
quality specimens for implementation across the widest range of research techniques. All cases
undergo a thorough neuropathologic examination by a specialist pathologist and are assigned DSMIV
and DSM 5 diagnoses following review of medical records and medical, family history and lifestyle
information provided by the donor and/or their family. Cohorts of people with a history of alcohol use
and controls with and without complicating factors (e.g. comorbid cigarette smoking, liver disease) are
then established to allow researchers to address specific questions. Access to tissue is open to any
researcher with institutional ethics approval, following approval by an NIAAA-convened Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure appropriate and efficient use of the resource. The BTRC holds institutional
ethics approval to collect, hold and distribute tissues and associated data. Its operations are overseen
by a Director, Associate Professor Greg Sutherland, and Manager, Ms Julia Stevens, both of whom
have extensive experience in biobanking and alcohol research and have, over their careers,
contributed directly to 22 alcohol-related research articles. Since 2000, the BTRC has facilitated 277
publications on various aspects of alcohol use, with another 400+ publications on various neurological
and psychiatric disorders."

People with cancer have a higher risk of infections in general because of vulnerabilities arising
from their cancer and its treatments. This is especially true for the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-
2. People with cancer are twice as likely to die from COVID-19 compared to the general
population, with some subgroups appearing to fare much worse. The pandemic has also led to
significant disruption in cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment, which is anticipated to lead
to an indirect increase in morbidity and mortality in this population. Thus, studying COVID-19 in
people with cancer is highly warranted. In this U01 project, “The COVID-19 and Cancer
Consortium (CCC19) Registry”, we leverage the established CCC19 registry (NCT04354701),
which is the largest registry of adults with COVID-19 and cancer in North America, to answer a
number of important scientific questions. In Aim 1, we evaluate how anticancer treatments, anti-
COVID-19 treatments, vaccination, and, importantly, their interactions modify short- and long-
term complications. We will explore whether race, ethnicity, and sociodemographic factors (e.g.,
insurance, access to treatment) are associated with outcomes. We will explore whether data-
driven feature selection with machine-learning algorithms reveals unrecognized associations. In
Aim 2, we hypothesize that there will be measurable changes in cancer recurrence and
progression in patients who survive COVID-19. We will also investigate whether anticancer
treatment modifications, which we have observed in 40% of patients who were on anticancer
therapy at the time of infection, will affect longer-term prognosis. In Aim 3, we will develop
methods to measure ascertainment and collider biases, which are some of the most important
sources of bias in registry-based study designs. Along with these aims, we will continue to support
and maintain the CCC19 registry and promote its use by the general community, following the
FAIR principles."

This application for renewal of the Cardiovascular T32 training program at the University of Hawaii
draws on the strengths of our Center for Cardiovascular Research (CCR) and our established
graduate program in Cell and Molecular Biology. We also have maintained and enhanced an alliance
with the Cardiovascular Division at Stanford University Medical School to enrich the local academic
environment and increase the number of seasoned senior investigators available as mentors for our
trainees. In recent years our medical school has embarked on a new direction, emphasizing basic
investigation that has instilled new energy into our graduate programs. We have moved into a modern
campus on the shore of Honolulu and attracted nationally competitive investigators. Our
Cardiovascular Center has recruited or developed 6 independent investigators who have a principal
focus on cardiovascular investigation. In addition we have a group of UH faculty with established
research programs pertinent to cardiovascular science. We now have the critical mass of
investigators needed for a successful T32 program. During our first cycle of funding we were the only
T32 in the State. During both cycles we have had success in training under-represented minority
scientists and in helping our trainees to obtain independent grant funding. During the past cycle we
also saw the development of a joint T32 between the Cancer Center and USC as well as a K12
program in Tropical Medicine. We assisted both programs in their applications and they have helped
to augment our training efforts and the pool of young investigators at the School. We still have our
roots in our minority-serving, clinically-focused school, but are adding an important level of scientific
sophistication to serve our special location and multiethnic population. During the third cycle of
funding, described in this application, we will continue to place our best graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in laboratories devoted to cardiovascular projects, and provide mentoring that will
help them succeed. They will benefit from an established curriculum, CCR core resources, and will
also be able to draw upon the Stanford Cardiovascular Division for world-class expertise and
research resources. We request support for three graduate students and three postdoctoral fellows
per year. We expect, on average, that the graduate students will be supported for no more than three
years and the postdocs for no more than two years before they either finish or obtain independent
funding. Thus we anticipate supporting approximately 7 individual postdoctoral fellows and 5 graduate
students during the 5 years of this program. Our goal is to train our next generation of cardiovascular
investigators, with special attention to the priorities of our local population."
10797440,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The last decade has seen significant advances in stroke prevention, treatment, rehab and recovery. Yet, more externally valid effectiveness trials with diverse populations are critical. The NIH Stroke Trials Network (Stroke Net) was founded with the purpose of addressing inefficiencies with trial start-up, conduction and the high cost associated with lengthy processes. The use of a single IRB, standardized, non-negotiable contracts and use of a single electronic data capture system (webDCU) were implemented in order to reduce start-up times, costs and improve data quality. Inclusion of centers across the US aims to increase participant numbers and diversity. University of Utah Health (UUH) is a highly successful NIH Stroke Net Regional Coordinating Center (RCC). Utah (UT) Stroke Net is centered in the Mountain West, a 5-state region covering 10% of the U.S. landmass with 25 million inhabitants of increasing diversity. UT Stroke Net includes 11 Clinical Performing Sites (CPS), 9 adult and 2 pediatric, in Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and Montana, with a 12th site pending activation in Idaho. In the next funding period, UT Stroke Net will continue supporting and investing in its network of geographically dispersed sites and provide the diverse patients of the Mountain West access to NIH-funded stroke trials in prevention, treatment, and recovery- including under-represented minority patients and those living far from academic medical centers. UT Stroke Net will utilize innovative recruitment and retention methods coupled with the development of tools that ensure equity of access to clinical trial for all patients by capitalizing on existing tele stroke and tele neurology networks as well as deep CTSI recruitment resources. UT Stroke Net will also facilitate multi- disciplinary collaborations of local clinical and translational stroke experts in order to propose innovative trials to NINDS and the Network. UT Stroke Net will foster the education and career development of post-doctoral clinical and translational scientists through a focused, individualized training program that includes experiential learning, a mentored research project, targeted methodological training and optional courses tailored to the individual trainee. By achieving these goals, UT Stroke Net will contribute to the continued development of the national network, advancement of stroke research, and, ultimately, an improvement of stroke care for all persons in the Mountain West."
10797494,"Type 1 diabetes represents a major public health burden. While the availability of improved insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors has eased some of the daily practical and psychological burden of T1D, technology has not dramatically improved glucose control, with studies conducted by the T1DExchange ~5 years apart showing no improvement in HbA1c over the lifespan. There has also been only limited improvement in the shortened lifespan observed in those with T1D, and the incidence of T1D has increased over the last twenty or more years. Initiated and perpetuated by a complex interplay of genetic risk factors, environmental triggers and dysregulated immune responses, the natural history of T1D unfolds in a series of events that progress at variable rates towards onset of clinical disease. Yet the precise correlates and determinants of T1D pathogenesis remain incompletely defined. The identification and validation of novel biomarkers is critical to promote better stratification of T1D risk and progression, can illuminate pathways of disease pathogenesis and heterogeneity, and likely will inform the development of interventional strategies to delay or prevent disease. 
To precipitate the identification of robust and improved biomarkers, the TrialNet consortium designed the key question 1 (KQ1) PBMC study, a nested case/control study of 178 multiple Aab+ at-risk individuals that over a period of three years either did (“cases”) or did not (“controls”) progress to clinical disease. This earlier study aimed to correlate the evolution of transcriptomic and phenotypic immune cell profiles with incipient T1D onset. KQ1 analyses incorporating detailed clinical metadata are currently ongoing, and we now seek to complement these efforts with a broad interrogation of soluble serum factors from the very same KQ1 donor cohort. Here, the “KQ1 serum study” aims to 1., to identify and validate serum biomarkers for T1D risk, development and/or progression; 2., to establish a comprehensive data resource for reference and orientation, hypothesis generation and improved interventional study design; and 3., to execute broadly integrated data analyses in particular with emerging transcriptional and phenotypic immune cell data from the KQ1 cohort. To this end, we have identified and prioritized suitable targets and analytical approaches, robust technology platforms, and investigator teams with track records to perform high-throughput analyses. Since the scope of our proposal is delimited by the amount of available KQ1 serum samples, we developed a highly collaborative Research Plan that deploys both discovery- and hypothesis-driven investigative strategies. Our proposed interrogations include expansive measurements of serum proteins, antibody responses against commensal bacteria, PBMC responder transcriptomics, and exocrine pancreatic factors. Integrative analytics will be leveraged to define novel serum signatures for T1D risk stratification, improve prediction of disease progression rates, and elucidate aspects of T1D pathogenesis that may accelerate the development of tailored diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic modalities. Altogether, the KQ1 serum study has unique potential to build a robust framework for future integration of serum biomarkers in the improved management of T1D."
10797790,"Project Summary/Abstract. The overarching goal for the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) Oklahoma Tribal,
Rural, Urban Cancer Screening Trial (OK TRUST) ACCESS Hub is to enhance capacity for increasing cancer
screening trials accrual and participation among tribal, rural and urban populations across Oklahoma. OK
TRUST is designed specifically to accrue large numbers of participants from these groups, as tribal, rural, and
low-income urban populations have disproportionately high cancer rates, but low rates of participation in
clinical trials at the national level. To increase clinical trial accessibility in rural locations, OK TRUST Affiliate
Organizations include a large, rural federally qualified health center (FQHC) with seven primary clinics, two
rural Tribes operating 10 tribal primary care clinics, and another rural Tribe closely associated with three Indian
Health Service clinics. As inaccessibility to clinical trials also affects low-income patients living in urban areas,
OK TRUST includes two large urban FQHCs located in Oklahoma City, one operating 21 clinics serving
predominately Spanish-speaking patients and the other operating 7 clinics serving many Black/African
American patients, and University of Oklahoma clinics in Oklahoma City and Tulsa that also serve large
numbers of Black/African American patients. OK Trust also includes the Oklahoma City Indian Clinic - the
largest urban Indian healthcare facility in the nation. In aggregate, 80,000 persons aged 45 to 70 years receive
healthcare at the OK TRUST Affiliate Organizations. Given the historical distrust between American Indian
communities and academic researchers and centers, it is notable that several Tribes and American Indian-
serving clinical facilities are participating in a project collecting biological data. These partners are involved
because they understand the impact that new cancer screening tests may have on reducing cancer disparities
among American Indian people. They also understand that a robust governance structure will guide use and
sharing of data involving American Indian participants, because Tribes, as sovereign nations, have rights that
are unique among underrepresented groups in the United States. Specifically, OK TRUST will implement
processes to: 1) Provide leadership and administrative support needed to conduct CSRN trials across tribal,
rural, and urban affiliate organizations in the Oklahoma catchment area and participate in shaping the CSRN
emerging research agenda. Provide leadership and administrative support to enhance the infrastructure
necessary to ensure Cancer Screening Research Network trial availability and participation across a diverse
set of tribal, rural, and urban Affiliate Organizations; 2) Expand access to and increase enrollment in cancer
screening trials by offering the Vanguard study, and future studies, in participants’ home communities and
healthcare facilities; and 3) Leverage SCC’s nationally recognized expertise in the provision of clinical trials to
include regulatory and operational support for cancer screening trials offered in tribal, rural and urban locations
statewide."

10798560,"ABSTRACT
Racial/ethnic minorities are projected to be a major portion of the aging U.S. population. Two of the strategic
research directions of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) are: 1) improving understanding of Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and 2) understanding health disparities to improve the health of
diverse older adult populations as evidenced by NOT-AG-21-033. While achieving these goals for racial/ethnic
disparities requires data, national aging research data are absent beyond (mostly White) Latinx, non-Latinx
Whites, and non-Latinx Blacks. Collecting research data under the traditional sampling framework is resource
intensive and prohibitively so for granular minority groups. In response to NOT-AG-21-033 that addresses this
gap, this study aims to improve inclusivity in ADRD research data by introducing Hybrid Sampling (HybS) for
building a nationally representative panel of middle-age and older adults with an oversample of seven granular
minority groups (Afro Latinx, non-Afro Latinx, Chinese, Asian Indians, Filipinos, Koreans and Vietnamese)
through the push-to-Web method. As an extension of address-based sampling (ABS) and respondent driven
sampling (RDS), HybS starts from a probability sample of seeds and exploits existing social networks for
participant recruitment through chain-referrals, capturing those who, otherwise, are difficult to reach, while
maintaining the probability sampling principles. To do so, we apply the push-to-Web method that also offers an
option of participating over phone to lower the costs and the constraints associated with the time, geography
and interview language. Racial/ethnic minorities are particularly well suited for the push-to-Web HybS, as they
are known to form tight in-group social networks and to access the Web at a high level. For managing such a
panel survey, we will also develop a sample management system and make it publicly available.
 Capitalizing on the connectedness of participants, this study will measure social networks from multiple
angles and examine the role of various social networks on ADRD risks and racial/ethnic disparities within. This
study will collect data using the same methods across racial/ethnic groups, which will eliminate methodological
confounders in examining disparities. Although rare, there are scientifically rigorous and well-established
population-based data about minorities and aging research data. We will triangulate data from these existing
studies with data from the proposed study’s panel through multiple frame estimation in order to improve its
representation properties. By developing a practical data collection framework and providing tools to implement
studies under this framework, outcomes of this study will enable the research community to address the needs
for ADRD data on granular racial/ethnic minorities. Increased inclusivity of research data will inform policy
makers to develop nuanced ADRD prevention and intervention strategies, which further leads to improving
conditions of minorities and reducing disparities among older adults, an important goal of the NIA."
10812232,"This application is a competing renewal of the ""Vervet Research Colony as a Biomedical Resource"" 
(VRC, P40-OD010965). The VRC is the only NIH-funded biomedical research resource for US-born 
vervet/African green monkeys (AGM; Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) and has been continuously funded 
since 2005. The VRC serves a wide range of local, regional and national investigators by providing 
animals, biological samples, data, consultation and training pertaining to the use of vervets/AGMs 
as multi-categorical, translational models of human disease. Since the previous renewal, the VRC 
has provided resources to over 100 investigators, including over 250 animals and over 1,500 
biological samples, as well as data and consultation. The VRC has also provided the necessary 
infrastructure and technical expertise enabling the on-site use of over 600 animals across 30 
different studies. The VRC has facilitated critical translational research across a wide variety of 
disciplines, including: a) the development of the vervet as an emerging nonhuman primate model of 
Alzheimer's disease risk with a focus on the assessment of amyloid burden, neurodegenerative 
disease biomarkers, and synaptic degeneration; b) investigations into the efficacy and enhancement 
of vaccines for infectious diseases such as neonatal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and 
dengue fever; c) studies focused on the etiology and health consequences of diabetes, metabolic 
disease and obesity; d) the development of novel, non-invasive biomedical imaging methodologies; 
and e) the expansion of the critical genetic resources available for vervets, including the 
sequencing of the vervet genome. The aims of the VRC resource are to: 1) provide the scientific 
community with access to animals, biological samples, data and expertise to facilitate the use of 
vervets for a wide-range of biomedical research; 2) to provide exceptional training opportunities 
for veterinarians and researchers interested in using vervets for translational research, and to 
serve as a platform for community and scientific outreach to foster better understanding of the use 
of nonhuman primates in biomedical research; and 3) to enhance the resource by engaging in applied 
research focused on continuing genetic and phenotypic characterization of vervets across the 
lifespan and evaluation of the vervet as a potential translational model in novel research areas. 
The VRC is a critical component of the Wake Forest Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), 
which provides administrative support and facilitates the utilization of the VRC resource across 
the larger CTSA network. The VRC is able to take full advantage of a wide-range of existing 
research facilities within the Wake Forest School of Medicine, including multi-modal imaging 
capabilities, veterinary and pathology expertise, and genetic and analytic resources."
10810571,"Project Summary
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are highly transmissible causative agents of benign and malignant
tumors/neoplasia in mucosal and cutaneous squamous epithelium. Papillomavirus (PV) disease is primarily
driven by the viral early proteins, E6 and E7. Despite prophylactic vaccines that can prevent infection by up to
nine HPV genotypes that cause genital warts, respiratory papillomas, pre-cancerous lesions, and malignancies,
millions of unvaccinated people and those with existing infections will develop HPV-related diseases for
the next two decades. Unfortunately, treatments for HPV-associated diseases, precancers, and cancers have
not been significantly improved for decades; current therapies lack HPV specificity, have high recurrence rates,
and pose risk of long-term morbidities with reduced quality of life. To date, there are no effective antiviral
HPV therapies and no cure for HPV infections.
We recently reported that the cellular MEK/ERK signaling pathway is a critical regulator of HPV early gene
expression and showed that MEK inhibitors (MEKi’s) profoundly suppress HPV early gene transcription
and neoplastic phenotypes in vitro; systemically delivered MEKi’s also lead to tumor regression in
mouse preclinical models of HPV tumorigenesis. However, oral MEKi’s have toxic side effects in humans.
As HPV lesions are localized and accessible at superficial epithelial sites, we propose to develop novel topical
MEK inhibitor (MEKi) formulations for the treatment of localized HPV-induced diseases. Preliminary data
support the feasibility and innovation of our approaches. In this proof-of-concept study, we will leverage
complementary preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of PV disease. We will use mucosal- and cutaneous-like
in vitro 3D epithelial tissue models to optimize the topical MEKi formulations for delivery to the basal epithelial
cells where PV genome persistence is maintained via early gene expression. In Aim 1, we will study how altered
formulations affect the depth of epithelial penetration, the longevity of MEK inhibition, and the suppression of
viral early gene expression in these in vitro models, which will inform how to alter formulations for testing in the
two in vivo MmuPV1 tumor/neoplasia models (Aim 2). Aim 2 will test topical MEKi formulations with the greatest
capacity for MEK inhibition in the basal cells in vitro for their ability to cause regression in preclinical murine
models of established MmuPV1 dorsal skin tumors and to reduce preneoplastic disease severity and progression
in MmuPV1-mediated cervicovaginal disease. Formulations and application frequencies will then be optimized
with a goal of achieving MEKi activities that are equal to or greater than those we find via oral MEKi delivery.
Successful completion of this project will position us to determine drug pharmacokinetics and confirm the
subsequent reduction achieved for systemic drug exposure; we will then submit an FDA investigational new drug
application to carry out clinical studies testing the efficacy of a topical MEKi in the treatment of persistent HPV
diseases."
10811631,"Project Summary/Abstract: The Na/K-ATPase (NKA), or “sodium pump”, is an enzyme that transports ions
across cell membranes. Between 30-70% of the cell’s ATP budget is spent by the NKA to create strong
chemical gradients for sodium and potassium. These gradients control cell volume, support electrical signaling
(action potentials) and energize many other transport processes. Disruption of sodium handling is associated
with diseases including cardiac hypertrophy/failure, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s
disease. Various cell types in diverse tissues of the body have very different requirements for Na/K transport,
and transport rates must respond to physiological challenges (e.g. exercise). To adapt NKA to these different
conditions, the pump is regulated by tissue-specific transmembrane peptides that increase or decrease the
pump’s enzymatic activity. In Aim 1 of the project we will focus on the normal physiological regulation of
NKA by FXYDs, testing how FXYD proteins bind and stabilize specific NKA conformations to alter NKA
transport kinetics. We will use novel spectroscopic assays to investigate the structure and stability of different
NKA-FXYD regulatory complexes. We will investigate how physical coupling of two pumps into a single
functional unit can allow faster overall cycling. Aim 2 is the translational arm of the research project. The
research team will investigate how NKA regulation by FXYDs becomes disordered in disease, using proteomic
analysis to compare the NKA-FXYD interactome in healthy and failing human heart tissue. We will determine
whether fragments of digested membrane proteins may disrupt NKA function in disease. We will also test the
feasibility of using gene delivery of an inhibitory species (FXYD1) as a therapy to improve the contraction
strength of a failing heart. Finally, we will compare FXYDs that activate NKA and FXYDs that inhibit NKA.
 The project brings together 6 different investigators that specialize in different complementary approaches.
The laboratory of the project PI, Prof. Seth Robia, uses fluorescence spectroscopy and cell physiology to
investigate the structure, affinity, and function of NKA-FXYD complexes in cardiac myocytes and heterologous
cells. He works closely with two Loyola University Chicago colleagues: Jonathan Kirk (Co-I) and Pete
Kekenes-Huskey (Co-I). Prof. Kirk will use proteomics approaches such as mass spectrometry to discover post-
translational modifications and novel NKA regulators. Prof. Kekenes-Huskey will assist with computational
modeling of the protein complexes. Prof. Julie Bossuyt (MPI) will investigate a-a coupling, conducting
microscopy and biochemistry experiments to identify the interaction interface. Prof. Artigas (Co-I) at Texas
Tech will perform detailed electrophysiological analyses of FXYD proteins and membrane protein fragments.
Prof. Razvan Cornea (Consultant) is an expert in membrane protein biophysics. He will advise the team on all
aspects of the project. Together, the collaborators will uncover important new information about NKA-FXYD
structure/function relationships, and learn how these mechanisms become disordered in disease."
10811635,"Summary
Hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are regulated by a balanced signaling network, which is critical
for HSPC homeostasis and prevention of malignant transformation. We previously showed that protein
ubiquitination by CBL family E3 ubiquitin ligases controls JAK2 stability and activity that is important for curbing
HSPC expansion and myeloid malignancies. Here we identified a novel signaling axis, where CBL/JAK2
upregulates RAB27B to enhance NRAS GTPase activity and ERK signaling. Importantly, aberrant activation of
this pathway is critical for leukemia cell growth conferred by CBL and RAS mutations. Intracellular signaling can
be dynamically modulated by post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate the temporal and spatial
distribution of signaling proteins. RAB27B, a Rab GTPase that is resident in the Golgi and endosome
membranes, regulates intracellular vesicle trafficking, docking, and fusion with plasma membrane (PM). Rab27b
knockout mice display normal steady-state hematopoiesis. Strikingly, we found that Rab27b deficiency in primary
HSPCs abrogates mutant but not wildtype NRAS-mediated signaling and cell growth. Mechanistically, we
demonstrated that RAB27B regulates NRAS palmitoylation, GTPase activity, stability, and subsequent c-
RAF/MEK/ERK activation. RAS proteins propagate signals only when associated with cellular membranes as a
consequence of various PTMs that impact their trafficking between endomembranes and the PM. Therefore, a
precise understanding of RAS’ interaction with membranes and trafficking is essential to understand RAS action
and to intervene in RAS-driven cancers. The discovery of RAB27B as a novel regulator of RAS palmitoylation,
a lipid modification for membrane anchors, propelled us to further define the molecular basis underlying the
regulation of RAS/ERK signaling by CBL/JAK2/RAB27B and explore its functional significance in malignant
HSPCs. In aim 1, we will investigate if Rab27b deficiency mitigates chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML)
development and malignant HSPC expansion induced by mutant Nras or Cbl deficient mice. More importantly
we will study if Rab27b deficiency dampens NRAS signaling, stability, lipid modification and subcellular
localization. In aim 2, we will use live-cell imaging and biochemical assays as well as genetic approaches, to
dissect the dynamic regulation of NRAS trafficking, palmitoylation, and compartmentalized signaling by RAB27B.
In aim 3, we will investigate the role of mutant CBL/JAK2 in regulating RAB27B level and explore the therapeutic
potential of targeting RAB27B in primary HSPCs from human myeloid malignancies. RAS pathway mutations
including NRAS and CBL define the proliferative CMML (pCMML) phenotype that is aggressive, predisposed to
AML transformation and associated with dismal outcomes. This work uncovers novel RAB27B-mediated
compartmentalized signaling dynamics that is crucial to key signaling proteins, and serves the basis for future
therapeutic strategies for molecular targeting."

Candidate. For my postdoctoral training, I transitioned from neurobiology-based methods in mouse sensory
processing (PhD), to molecular and genetic approaches in human neurodevelopment. At present, a large gap
exists in the field of functional neurogenomics, whereby clinically-derived genomic analysis is currently unable
to be faithfully translated into functional data. My continued training with Dr. Christopher Walsh's research
group will build into this research niche by supporting my development of new expertise in human genetics
and single-cell approaches. Further, my long-term goal is to develop the broad skills needed to assess how genes
that affect cellular excitability (e.g. channels, pumps, exchangers) can instruct neural circuit development; this
complements well with my graduate training, where I developed expertise in the cellular basis of electrical
signaling in olfactory and cerebellar neural circuits. In particular, my graduate studies cemented my expertise
in neural systems physiology and single neuron contributions to circuit function, including whole-cell patch
clamp electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics, chemogenetics, and in-vivo behavioral paradigms. The
application of these skills to the area of human neurodevelopment will form the basis for developing my
independent research program.
Research. The idea that ion channels can disrupt cortex formation is a new area of study, particularly when
exploring the mechanisms activated at a cellular level. Since dividing progenitor cells and newborn neurons in
the developing cerebral cortex rely on ions for controlling cellular processes, I will test the new hypothesis that
disrupted activity of specific ion fluxes is critical to cortex assembly. Proof of the existence of developmental
channelopathies in the brain has remained elusive due to the heterogenous nature of cortical malformations
and the fact that they are often are under extreme negative pressure evolutionarily. Given that I am describing
and categorizing brain disorders that improve our understanding of disease mechanisms and the treatment of
conditions related to malformation of cortical development (MCD), the significance of this work to human health
is immediate as the results generated by this research will immediately improve genetic testing for diagnosed
disorders. I will complete this research with a combination of both proven and innovative strategies, including:
1) sequencing analysis of non-consanguineous and consanguineous families to identify gene variants involved
in brain malformations; 2) characterizing a novel mouse model for a developmental channelopathy;
3) development of a novel physiological assay in developing human cerebral organoids."
10811746,"Abstract
Substance use disorders (SUD) are a major public health problem that impact millions of people and their
families. The factors that contribute to SUD vulnerability, as well as the transition from drug use to abuse to
SUD remain unclear. We know that the reward value for alcohol and drugs of abuse normally varies by time of
day. For example, for most individuals, the desire to drink wine or beer is very different at 6:00am compared to
6:00pm. There is a normal, time of day dependent, rhythm in the reward value for these drinks and this rhythm
is protective against SUD. In fact one of the key factors that is used to evaluate the transition to addiction is the
loss of diurnal rhythmicity in reward value (the desire to drink alcohol in the morning for example). In addition to
alcohol, when the reward circuitry has been hijacked by chronic exposure to other drugs of abuse, circadian
rhythms in reward circuitry are lost, and these rewards overtime develop equal value at any time of day.
Genetic factors (circadian gene variations) also contribute to reduced rhythms in reward at baseline, prior to
any drug exposure, and increased SUD-related vulnerability. Indeed mice with circadian gene mutations show
greater drug self-administration and a loss in the normal diurnal rhythm in this behavior. By determining the
molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie natural diurnal rhythms in reward, we can potentially help
prevent the transition between use to abuse to SUD. Our previous studies have found strong diurnal
differences in many aspects of reward circuitry including excitability of neurons in the nucleus accumbens
(NAc). We have also found that the circadian protein, NPAS2 plays an important role in the NAc in the
regulation of drug reward. In this R01 renewal, we first want to determine if this diurnal difference in excitability
is similar in D1R, D2R or cholinergic cells, if it is similar in males and females, if Npas2 mutants have disrupted
rhythmicity in MSN excitability, and if this rhythmicity is altered by chronic cocaine self-administration. We then
want to identify at a transcriptome level what actively transcribed genes have diurnal rhythms in specific cell
types in the NAc. This will help us identify the molecular mechanisms underlying these normal diurnal
differences in evoked response. We will then determine how these molecular rhythms are altered with chronic
cocaine self-administration. Finally, we will test particular molecular factors to determine their role in regulating
diurnal rhythms in excitability. Taken together, the study of the mechanisms that underlie diurnal rhythmicity in
reward are important and can help us develop future treatments that help maintain and strengthen these
normal rhythms."
10811747,"Predict to Prevent: Dynamic Spatiotemporal Analyses of Opioid Overdose to Guide
 Pre-Emptive Public Health Responses
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Opioid overdose (OD) fatalities have reached crisis levels in all socioeconomic and geographic communities
in the US. By utilizing a first-of-its-kind statewide Public Health Data Warehouse (PHD) with multiple
linked administrative datasets and state-of-the-art Bayesian spatiotemporal models, we are in a unique
position to fill in the fundamental gaps in the field’s ability to rapidly identify current OD patterns,
predict future OD epidemics, and evaluate the effectiveness of public health and clinical interventions.
In Massachusetts (MA), the State Legislature enacted policy in 2015 that provided authorization to the MA
Department of Public Health (MDPH) to develop a massively linked administrative dataset to allow public
health officials and policymakers to better understand the extent of and contributors to the opioid OD epidemic.
The PHD Warehouse, representing 98% of the MA population, currently links data from 25+ distinct sources
(e.g., death records, all-payer claims, post-mortem toxicology, hospital discharges, and the prescription
monitoring program). Supported by strong preliminary studies demonstrating the power of the PHD and our
strong partnership with MDPH, we aim to develop a new population health analytic framework to support opioid
OD control in MA that can be generalizable to other parts of the country. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Develop
a Bayesian multilevel spatiotemporal model to identify individual, interpersonal, community, and societal
factors that contribute to opioid OD; 2) develop an efficient Bayesian spatiotemporal model to identify time-
space OD clusters, and extend the model to construct a dynamic predictive model; and, 3) evaluate and
predict policy and intervention effects through model-based simulation studies to provide practical guidance
and decision-making support to public health officials. Aims 1, 2 and 3 can be easily adopted and reproduced
by users in other public health jurisdictions and sectors to foster cross-sector, cross-agency opioid OD control.
Our approach is innovative due to the use of PHD and sophisticated Bayesian spatiotemporal modeling
approaches. The proposed study is highly significant, because it is conceptualized to improve current and
future public health practice, facilitating data-driven and evidence-based implementation science interventions
in the locations at greatest risk and at the time when they are most needed. Our results can immediately and
significantly influence opioid OD prevention policies and practices, guiding pre-emptive public health and
clinical responses. We will develop our visualization tools, analytical approaches, and related code, in
collaboration with MDPH and our Community Advisory Board (CAB), to enhance PHD capabilities and improve
dissemination of findings. Our tools, approaches, and code will also be made available for national
dissemination, providing paradigm shifting approaches to address the opioid crisis. Our research directly
addresses NIDA’s goal to “Develop new and improved strategies to prevent drug use and its consequences.”"
10811674,"Project Summary/Abstract
The Human Genome Project (HGP) completed the first draft human genome sequence two decades ago. The
HGP revealed that human complexity arises from only approximately 20,000 coding genes, roughly the same
number as much simpler organisms such as nematodes. Intricate patterns of transcriptional regulation mediated
by non-coding regulatory elements specify the myriad cell types and states required for human complexity.
Genome-wide association studies have subsequently identified thousands of disease-associated variants, many
of which interrupt the function of these non-coding elements to disrupt transcriptional regulation. Thus, in order
to better understand human physiology and pathophysiology, comprehensive atlases of regulatory elements are
essential. Many previous efforts, including the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC), the
FANTOM Consortium, the Roadmap Epigenomics Project, and the ENCODE Project, have aimed to build
comprehensive collections of regulatory elements, as well as computational models to better predict regulatory
activity and understand the sequence features underlying regulatory function. ENCODE (2003-2022) is a large-
scale consortium effort which aims to annotate every functional non-coding element of the human genome;
during our work on the project, we built a Registry of approximately 1 million human candidate cis-regulatory
elements (cCREs). We further developed deep-learning approaches which model the transcription factor motif
syntax that underlies element function at base-pair resolution and built two web-based resources, SCREEN and
Factorbook, to make our results accessible to the scientific community. Here, we propose to extend this
framework to build the Community Resource for Transcriptional Regulation (CRTR), a comprehensive atlas of
non-coding regulatory elements and machine-learning models which will encompass community and consortium
deep-sequencing data, both bulk and single cell, across a broad array of cell types and states. Our project has
five aims. First, we aim to curate community and consortium data for inclusion in CRTR and perform uniform
processing and quality control. Second, we aim to train deep-learning sequence models on bulk epigenetic
datasets to identify transcription factor motif syntax driving regulatory element activity in distinct tissues and cell
types. Third, we aim to train sequence models on single cell datasets to identify transcription factor motif syntax
driving transcriptional regulation in high-resolution cell states and during cell state transitions. Fourth, we aim to
use the aforementioned results to build comprehensive benchmark datasets and machine-learning model
collections, which will aid future analysts in designing new models to predict regulatory readouts. Fifth, we aim
to build a state-of-the-art web-based user interface to enable users to perform integrative analyses and in silico
experimentation with CRTR, and hold workshops and other outreach to maximize the impact of the resource and
its accessibility to the broader scientific community."

Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and are increasingly prevalent due to an aging
population with diabetes, heart failure and hypertension. Atrial fibrillation (AF) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), are
chaotic arrhythmias, whereas, atrial tachycardia (AT), atrial flutter (AFL) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) are
more organized, focal or macro-reentrant arrhythmias. Our grasp of the specific mechanisms that allow for the
cardiac substrate to harbor organized and/or chaotic rhythms is incomplete. Causative factors of arrhythmias
include fibrosis, increased late Na+ current and increased reactive oxidative stress (ROS) causing augmented
mitophagy, which is a process of eliminating defective mitochondria to maintain the overall health of the
mitochondrial pool. Our methodological breakthrough is to use 3D panoramic anatomical and optical mapping,
in conjunction with mitophagy detection to characterize the interplay amongst electrical activation, substrate
heterogeneity due to fibrosis and mitophagy, and action potential duration (APD) heterogeneity. Our proposed
concept is that larger or greater number of areas of fibrosis, APD heterogeneity and/or mitophagy will allow for
more chaotic atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. By individually disrupting these pathways and defining the
consequences on arrhythmogenesis, we will determine how these three processes are co-regulated or
functionally inter-dependent. We crossed mice with a reporter Keima protein which detects mitophagy, together
with two lines of transgenic mice with spontaneous and sustained AF, AFL, AT, VT and VF due to mutations in
the human cardiac NaV1.5 channel gene SCN5A. This project presents an integrated experimental approach
using (1) multi-modality imaging of whole hearts of murine models of Na+ overload with AF, AFL, AT, VT and VF
or myocardial infarction induced VT/VF to understand the mechanisms of organized and chaotic atrial and
ventricular arrhythmogenesis, (2) AAV delivery of mitochondrial catalase to reverse increased mitophagy after
myocardial infarction and (3) optogenetics via AAV delivery of channelrhodopsin-2 into whole murine hearts and
use of focused light stimulation to trigger, prevent and terminate atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. The proposed
experiments are highly significant and innovative in that co-registered 3D panoramic imaging will allow us to
dissect the mechanisms that drive organized and chaotic cardiac arrhythmias, which may lead to new and
effective treatment strategies of cardiac arrhythmias."
